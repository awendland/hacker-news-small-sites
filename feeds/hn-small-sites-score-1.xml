<h2 id="pointers-that-free-themselves">Pointers that free themselves</h2>

<p>If you are coming from the C world, you have been managing all your resources manually so far.
You allocate each heap memory block using <code>malloc</code> and need to take care of a call to <code>free</code> in every exit path of the function.
As you have probably observed already, this easily leads to human mistakes:
A forgotten <code>free</code> in just one exit path is enough to cause a severe memory leak.
Freeing a pointer twice or using it after a <code>free</code> happens just as easy and can be the source of very painful bugs.</p>

<p>Being a C API, Win32 is no different in this regard.
It offers you <code>HeapAlloc</code> and <code>HeapFree</code>, which are a bit closer to the operating system than their C library counterparts, but otherwise suffer from the same issues.</p>

<p>Now you may argue that YOU obviously never make such mistakes.
So let’s just talk about the code you import from someone else.
If you see a manual memory allocation there, how can you be sure that the programmer correctly handled all exit paths?
There is no way to ensure that unless you check the entire code yourself.</p>

<p>C++ has been trying to be better at memory management since its infancy.
But it has taken until 2011 for C++ to finally come up with a reliable solution that is also going to work tomorrow: <code>std::unique_ptr</code><br>
This template class is a wrapper around any object that you want to put on the heap.
It allocates memory for the wrapped object in its constructor and frees it in its destructor.
As C++ automatically calls the destructor whenever the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope, you can no longer forget that and the human is taken out of the equation.
This makes <code>std::unique_ptr</code> a so-called <em>smart pointer</em>.</p>

<p>If you have been into C++ for quite a while, you may know <code>std::unique_ptr</code>’s predecessor <code>std::auto_ptr</code>.
This one has been deprecated for good (and entirely removed in newer C++ standards) due to its unclear ownership semantics.
The details don’t matter here, just keep in mind that <code>std::unique_ptr</code> fully owns an object and can’t accidentally lose it.
Unlike <code>std::auto_ptr</code>, you can only transfer ownership of that object by using an explicit <code>std::move</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>std::unique_ptr</code> is only an option for allocating a single object.
It does not work for arrays, because those need to be freed differently (<code>delete[]</code> vs. <code>delete</code>).
While people have often asked for an “auto_array_ptr”, modern C++ offers something even better, which we will dive into in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="universal-c-containers">Universal C++ containers</h2>

<p>For a long time, C <code>char</code> arrays and C++ <code>std::string</code> have been two different worlds.
You could get a constant representation of a <code>char</code> array from an <code>std::string</code> using the <code>c_str</code> method, but a true two-way interaction between both types wasn’t possible.
As a result, legacy C interfaces like the Win32 API often limited you to using traditional C-style arrays without the benefits of modern C++ containers.
You had fun managing all the memory allocations yourself, making sure that nothing leaks, and doing <code>strlen</code> over and over again because a <code>char</code> array doesn’t know its size.</p>

<p>This has changed for good starting with C++11, which guarantees that an <code>std::string</code> is internally stored as a <code>char</code> array.
C++17 adds a <code>data</code> method returning a writable pointer to that <code>char</code> array, finally making <code>std::string</code>s universally usable in all places that use <code>char</code> arrays.</p>

<p>Extensive and error-prone code like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> szTest <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>;
<span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, szTest, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, NULL, <span>0</span>);

<span>const</span> WCHAR<span>*</span> wszTest <span>=</span> HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), <span>0</span>, cch <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span>(WCHAR));
<span>if</span> (<span>!</span>wszTest)
{
    printf(<span>"Out of memory!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
}

MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, szTest, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, wszTest, cch);

<span>// Do something with wszTest
</span><span>// Take care to clean it up in all exit paths using:
</span><span></span>
HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), <span>0</span>, wszTest);</code></pre></div>
<p>can finally become as simple as</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">std<span>::</span>string strTest <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>;
<span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, strTest, strTest.size(), <span>nullptr</span>, <span>0</span>);

std<span>::</span>wstring wstrTest;
wstrTest.resize(cch);
MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, strTest, strTest.size(), wstrTest.data(), cch);

<span>// Do something with wstrTest, cleanup happens automatically
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By the way, the same is also true for <code>std::vector</code>.
All your manual allocations of arrays, prone to buffer overflows and memory leaks, can finally be replaced by automatically managed <code>std::vector</code>s and still interact with APIs written in C.</p>

<h2 id="string-resources-without-regrets">String resources without regrets</h2>

<p>Let’s get deeper into Win32 specifics and use what we just learned.<br>
If you are writing applications for Windows, you have probably made good use of <em>resources</em> already.
Resources allow you to organize strings and graphics at a central location separated from your code.
Each resource is associated with a language code.
When running your application, Windows will pick the resource that best matches your operating system language setting.</p>

<p>For loading a Unicode string resource, the Win32 API of choice is the <code>LoadStringW</code> function.
Even if Microsoft sample code still does, you don’t want to use the ANSI counterpart <code>LoadStringA</code> and neither the <code>LoadString</code> macro that forwards to one of both.
Both were last needed in the era of Windows 95/98/Me, which didn’t come with native Unicode support.
The NT line of Windows has always supported Unicode from the kernel up to the applications.
All <code>A</code> functions there are implemented to convert the string to Unicode and then call the corresponding <code>W</code> function.
As we’re not targeting anything older than Windows XP here, we can (and should!) safely forget about <code>A</code> functions.
Some newer Windows APIs don’t even provide them anymore.</p>

<p>I have seen most people using <code>LoadStringW</code> by declaring a buffer that is “hopefully large enough” and letting the function copy the string into that buffer.
Even Microsoft sample code usually looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">WCHAR wszString[<span>100</span>];
LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_STRING_ID, wszString, <span>sizeof</span>(wszString) <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span>(WCHAR));
</code></pre></div>
<p>This code is potentially dangerous in multiple dimensions:<br>
1. If the string for a language later turns out to be longer than 99 characters (consider the terminating NUL), it is silently truncated.
In the best case, this only impacts your user experience badly.
In the worst case, the user loses critical information because the string is later fed to a formatting function like <code>printf</code> and now misses a format character.
2. The developer may forget to divide by the size of a <code>WCHAR</code> in the last parameter, thereby creating the illusion of a larger buffer and laying the foundation for a typical buffer overflow.
3. The return value of <code>LoadStringW</code> isn’t checked at all, hence <code>wszString</code> may be uninitialized.
If you later work with that buffer, expect things to go tremendously wrong.</p>

<p>Only few people know about the other (scarcely documented) way of using <code>LoadStringW</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>const</span> WCHAR<span>*</span> pString;
<span>int</span> CharacterCount <span>=</span> LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_STRING_ID, <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span>LPWSTR<span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>pString), <span>0</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of copying the resource string into a buffer, this call provides you with a read-only pointer to it.
All resources are already loaded into memory when starting your application, so retrieving the string this way performs no additional copying.
However, there is a caveat here:
The string is not necessarily NUL-terminated when being loaded this way.
This makes it hard to use the string directly in a pure C world where NUL-terminated strings are expected everywhere.
While we also get the character count from this <code>LoadStringW</code> call, we cannot just insert the missing NUL terminator ourselves due to the read-only nature of the string pointer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, C++ comes to the rescue here.
As we have learned that its <code>std::</code> classes are full-fledged alternatives to C-style character arrays these days, we can use them to fix our trouble with <code>LoadStringW</code>.
Enough said, the final function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">std<span>::</span>wstring LoadStringAsWstr(HINSTANCE hInstance, UINT uID)
{
    PCWSTR pws;
    <span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> LoadStringW(hInstance, uID, <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span>LPWSTR<span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>pws), <span>0</span>);
    <span>return</span> std<span>::</span>wstring(pws, cch);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>These 3 lines are sufficient to solve all of our problems above.
It doesn’t matter if the string is 10 or 1000 characters long, the function will transparently handle this.
It also doesn’t care about any terminating NUL character, because it just initializes a new <code>std::wstring</code> and copies the retrieved number of characters from the read-only resource pointer.
The returned <code>std::wstring</code> is guaranteed to be initialized and a comfortable and safe way to work with the loaded string.</p>

<p>I’m also using Hungarian notation in my final function to emphasize a few things.
The <code>pws</code> abbreviation refers to a <em>pointer to a wide-string</em>.
You may have more commonly seen <code>pwsz</code>, which would translate to a <em>pointer to a wide-string terminated by zero</em>.
As we just discussed, the latter part does not apply here, and this is underlined by the subtle difference in naming.
Similarly, <code>cch</code> stands for <em>count of characters</em> and distinguishes the integer variable from a count of bytes (<code>cb</code>).
You will deal with both when using Win32 API, and proper naming helps to not mess things up.</p>

<h2 id="mastering-the-handle-mess">Mastering the handle mess</h2>

<p>If you write your Win32 application in C, you soon have handles all over the place.
Every I/O operation, network connection or registry key, just to name a few, is identified by a handle variable that you must take care of.
When a resource is no longer needed, you need to close the handle manually - and again you must do so for all exit paths of your function.
This technique is susceptible to the same human mistakes that we …</p></div></div></div>

It taught me zero new things. I learned nothing that I had not already come across during my research for my latest book <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Life Beyond the Touch Screen</a>. Or that I had not even incorporated in the book.</p>
<p name="b017">I was, however, very much inspired by the documentary.</p>
<p name="b017"><em><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaaC57tcci0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></em></p>

<p name="b017"><em>[Note: Tristan Harris, together with Nir Eyal and Yuval Noah Harari, has been one of my greatest inspirations for creating "Life Beyond the Touch Screen". Nothing but respect. Read on to understand more.]</em></p>
<p name="a2d9">I was inspired because I recognized two things. One being the difficulty Tristan Harris — legendary former design ethicist at Google — and other former and current high-ranking executives from silicon valley, venture capitalists and academics were having;</p>
<blockquote name="fe84"><em>In trying to explain what was so wrong and so dangerous about the role digital technology is taking in our lives today.</em></blockquote>
<p name="b0e2">What is that problem?</p>
<p name="13db">This was the second thing I recognized. The problem is that next to and simultaneous to adding so much ease and benefit to our lives, digital technology and mainly social media, are impacting our individual mental health, the mental health of our children, and the fabric of society and democracy in very, very dark ways as well.</p>
<p name="b43a">We are getting burn-out by the masses, staggeringly high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide in teens (mostly girls), and unprecedented levels of political polarization and tampering of election results with the help of an explosion of fake news. Propaganda, and real-life, deadly violence.</p>
<p name="5883">Why? Because armies of already genius experts in the psychology of persuasion and addiction, armed with the most powerful technology mankind has ever seen, are becoming more and more proficient at altering our behavior in minuscule but very, very real ways.</p>
<blockquote name="42dd">I am seriously afraid for our mental health, for that of our children, and for the world they will inherit.</blockquote>
<p name="d360">The problem underneath that being that the supercomputers and algorithms working to do that, are programmed from a capitalist and commercial perspective — so their highest goal is not humanity’s greater good: instead it is the highest possible profit.</p>
<p name="81e5">Our attention, time, and energy are being sold to the highest bidder. And as I have written before; maybe it’s <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-state-of-ai-in-the-world-56be75b51887" data-href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-state-of-ai-in-the-world-56be75b51887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a question of when A.I. starts taking over from us humans</a> — but rather a question of when we will wake up to the fact that it already has.</p>

<p name="e837">I was so inspired by “The Social Dilemma” that I created the above ArtfulGraphic, to try and help create momentum — in all honesty, also to possibly ride the hype I’m hopefully helping to create, and promote <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my book</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="1241">I drew a lady with a <em>black mirror</em> face, edited the picture in a wonderful app called Photofox, and then created the Graphic in PowerPoint — I’m no pro designer, sorry, not sorry.</p>
<p name="e1a1">Mainly, though, I created the above ArtfulGraphic to try to explain as simply as possible what’s going on.&nbsp;</p>

According to Caleb, this is the biggest money-making strategy.</p><p>I have also decided to add a middle tier (at u$d 70/m), where I provide Slack-based personal support, to help users of my plugin set-up GraphQL with WordPress, troubleshooting, and answering their questions. A user needed help to develop a functionality, so he decided to sponsor me &lt;= my first sponsor ❤️</p><p>Finally, I added a higher tier (at u$d 700) for corporate sponsors. I plan to ask around in the WordPress community if their companies may be interested in participating. That would be a win-win: They get plenty of face from contributing to open source, and I get the certainty that I can make a living wage from my work and can focus on the development of the plugin (and not on marketing, which is not my forte).</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/leoloso-github-sponsor-projects.png" alt="My sponsors and sponsored projects" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1210"><figcaption>My sponsors and sponsored projects</figcaption></figure><p>I hope the sponsorware model works, and I can make a living while working on open source.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><div><main role="main"><div><p>Configuring Google Analytics event tracking is vital to data analysis, because it is used to track user interactions. Analysing pageviews, sessions and visitors only lags context about the engagement of a website visitor.</p> <p>This is solved by collecting additional data from custom events that capture user interactions, such as link clicks for example.</p><p>Events represent user interactions or occurrences.<br>Usually, the most important interactions stand in relation to the goal of the website.<br> Hence, we set up custom event tracking to use it as a performance indicator to see, if our goals are being achieved.</p><p>Events can be grouped into <strong>hard conversions</strong> and <strong>soft conversions</strong> to account for their relation with the overall goal of the website.</p><p>Since events often are the basis to monitor conversions in an ecommerce or remarketing context, it is sometimes referred to as conversion tracking.<br>I distinguish between conversion tracking and tracking an event, since a conversion could also be a pageview or a <b>passive</b> occurence, as for example spending a certain amount of time on a landing page.</p><p>To illustrate what event tracking means, I will show you how to set up <strong>click tracking</strong> on a submit button. Afterwards, you should be able to set up your own unique click events on any element you like - so let's get started!</p><h2 id="what-is-event-tracking-in-google-analytics"><a href="#what-is-event-tracking-in-google-analytics" aria-label="What is event tracking in Google Analytics?" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>What is event tracking in Google Analytics?</h2><p>An event can either be an <strong>active user interaction</strong> or a <strong>passive occurrence</strong>. Tracking them means to watch or count the occurrences and set them in relation to users, visits and other dimensions for later analysis.</p><p>Since you are free to configure events the way you want, they can take many different forms.</p><h3 id="examples"><a href="#examples" aria-label="Examples" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Examples</h3><ul><li>add a product to a shopping basket</li><li>signup to an email list</li><li>scroll down to the bottom of an article</li><li>click play in a video</li><li>user login</li><li>click on an image to zoom</li><li>submission of a contact form</li><li>outbound link click</li><li>print an article</li><li>download a file</li></ul><p>As you can see, events are usually tied to something the user <em>does</em>, based on monitoring...</p><ul><li>mouse clicks</li><li>mouse movements</li><li>scrolling</li><li>browser navigation</li><li>keyboard inputs</li></ul><p>Events can also be <em>passive</em>, without the user doing anything actively.<br>For example, when the user spends a certain <strong>amount of time on a page</strong> or when a form returns an <strong>error</strong>. Also when a <strong>chatbot window</strong> opens up to talk to the visitor, there is no activity coming from the user.</p><p>Though a <b>page view</b> is technically also an interaction, the most widely used Universal Google Analytics counts a page view not as an event. However, the new Google Analytics App + Web (currently in Beta) uses a different data model which tracks page visits as events too.</p><h2 id="event-types"><a href="#event-types" aria-label="Event types" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Event types</h2><p>We can distinguish between two types of events:</p><h6 id="active-events-"><a href="#active-events-" aria-label="Active events (with user interaction)" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Active events (with user interaction)</h6><ul><li>mouse clicks, scroll tracking and mouse movement</li><li>screen touch</li><li>keyboard inputs</li></ul><h6 id="passive-events"><a href="#passive-events" aria-label="Passive events" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Passive events</h6><ul><li>hitting a predefined time threshold</li><li>Server responses</li><li>Programmatic validations</li><li>Third-party script execution</li></ul><p>Note that with tracking active and passive events, you can re-construct a big part of the<!-- --> <!-- -->customer journey<!-- -->. <br>Such data enables you to draw conclusions about the user's experience from beginning to end. If you find any flaws in the journey, you can now take action to reduce those negative experiences.</p><h2 id="structure-of-google-analytics-events"><a href="#structure-of-google-analytics-events" aria-label="Structure of Google Analytics Events" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Structure of Google Analytics Events</h2><p>Each event in Google Analytics holds some event fields, or bits of information about the event, that we can use to describe the occurrence:</p><ul><li><strong>event category</strong> - to categorize events in groups. In the context of a contact form, for example, you would want to group all events into an event category <em>contact form</em></li><li><strong>event action</strong> - to describe the interaction, e.g. <em>form submission</em></li><li><strong>event label</strong> - to add additional information about the interaction. For example, if the user is sending the <em>address of their website</em> along with the form, you use it to distinguish between the received forms</li><li><strong>event value</strong> - (<em>optional</em>) to add a numeric value to the information. For instance, if on avg. every 25th contact leads to a 100$ conversion, we could assign a value of <em>4</em> <!-- -->to each event.</li><li><strong>event non-interaction</strong> - to distinguish between an active or passive user interaction.<!-- --> <br>By default, it is set to <code>false</code>, which means the event counts as active.<!-- --> <strong>Important:</strong> Active events affect the calculation of a page's <b>bounce rate</b>, by lowering it. So if you ever struggle with an unrealisticly low bounce rate, chances are some events user-interaction is set to <code>true</code> by mistake.</li></ul><h2 id="implement-google-analytics-event-tracking"><a href="#implement-google-analytics-event-tracking" aria-label="Implement Google Analytics event tracking" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Implement Google Analytics event tracking</h2><p>There are two possible ways to implement custom event tracking:</p><ol><li><strong>Implement it</strong> with javascript snippets on all relevant HTML elements along with an onclick event handler - <strong>I don’t recommend this</strong> approach, since it is error-prone and not scalable. If you want to do this anyway, you can find code examples in<!-- --> <strong>Google’s event tracking documentation</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events" target="_blank">analytics.js event documentation (legacy)</a></li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/events" target="_blank">gtag.js event documentation</a></li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>Setting it up with Google Tag Manager</strong> or another <a href="https://bluerivermountains.com/en/tag-management">tag management system</a> of your choice. <br>Ease and flexibility when implementing changes, as well as scalability and easy integration with third-party services make it the preferred implementation method.</li></ol><p>I will explain how to track events with Google Tag Manager, since it is the most widely used tag management system everyone can get access to.</p><h2 id="guide-to-track-events-with-google-tag-manager"><a href="#guide-to-track-events-with-google-tag-manager" aria-label="Guide to track events with Google Tag Manager" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Guide to track events with Google Tag Manager</h2><p>Setting up custom event tracking can be broken down into creating a <strong>trigger</strong> for the event, as well as creating an <strong>event tag</strong>, which populates the event properties (<em>category, action, label</em>, etc.). <br>The values for the event properties can either be assigned statically or dynamically - where the latter is preferred for scaling the configuration over larger sites.</p><p>As an example, we are going to implement Google Analytics tracking for a button click.<!-- --> <strong>Click tracking</strong> is the most commonly used form of user behaviour tracking, so the example should be applicable to many other use cases.</p><p>At this point I assume that you already created a tracking ID and that the tracking code was implemented across the whole site when you <a href="https://bluerivermountains.com/en/google-analytics-setup">set up Google Analytics</a> with GTM.</p><h3 id="configure-the-event-trigger-in-google-tag-manager"><a href="#configure-the-event-trigger-in-google-tag-manager" aria-label="Configure the event trigger in Google Tag Manager" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Configure the event trigger in Google Tag Manager</h3><ul><li>First, we have to log into our <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager container</a> <!-- -->and <strong>create a new trigger</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li>Give your trigger a <strong>name</strong>, for example <strong>Click - Button</strong>, and click on the<!-- --> <strong>trigger configuration</strong> field to select a trigger type. You will see a list of trigger types slide in from the right.</li><li>Choose <strong>All Elements</strong> as the type and select, that the<!-- --> <strong>trigger only fires on some clicks</strong>.</li><li>Then, in the first dropdown, choose <strong>Click Element</strong>. If it's not listed, just click<!-- --> <strong>Choose built in variable…</strong> and activate it.</li></ul><ul><li>In the second dropdown, choose <strong>matches CSS selector</strong>.<br>Now let me explain what we’re doing:<br>We are trying to generate a click trigger for a specific HTML element on your website - the one you want to be tracking clicks on. In my example, it is a <strong>button</strong>, but it could also be an<!-- --> <strong>image</strong> or a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, or any other HTML tag - so the question is: How do we tell Google Tag Manager (GTM) which element to observe?<br>The Answer is: <strong>CSS selectors</strong> - You don’t know what that is? It is just a programmatic way of specifying HTML elements on the page and I will show you a way to get the CSS selector for any element with just a few mouse clicks.</li><li>In Google's Chrome browser, <strong>right-click</strong> any element you would like to track clicks on and select <strong>inspect</strong>. Chrome Developer Tools will open up and by default, the HTML element will be pre-selected.</li><li>Then you simply <strong>right-click</strong> the element and choose <strong>Copy</strong> &gt;<!-- --> <strong>Copy JS path</strong> (avoid <em>copy selector</em> - it returns faulty selectors from time to time).</li></ul><ul><li>If you paste the content of your clipboard into a text editor, you will see you copied something like:<p><code>document.querySelector("body &gt; ul &gt; button")</code></p><p>We want to take the part that is inside the brackets, without the “”. So, this part:</p><p><code>body &gt; ul &gt; button</code></p></li><li><strong>This is the CSS Selector</strong> we need to paste into the last field in our trigger configuration in GTM (<em>see below</em>).<br><strong>Copy</strong> that value and paste it in. Click <strong>save</strong>.</li></ul><p>Notice you could do this with any element and set up any event trigger in GTM as you like?</p><p>We are not done yet. After setting up the trigger conditions for our event, we have to configure the Google Analytics event tag to make sure the right data is sent to the Google Analytics property.</p><h3 id="create-a-custom-event-tag"><a href="#create-a-custom-event-tag" aria-label="Create a custom event tag" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Create a custom event tag</h3><p>Now that we have a trigger, we need to combine it with an actual event tag. You can think of triggers and tags as the <em>when</em> and <em>what</em> in our example: <br> The trigger defines <em>when</em> we want to track an event (<em>when our button is clicked</em>), and now we will define a GA event, that describes<!-- --> <em>what</em> we do: <em>Send an event to GA including all the right values for the event properties.</em></p><p>Let’s get started.</p><ul><li>In Google Tag Manager go to the tags menu and <em>create a new tag</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>Give the tag a <strong>name</strong> like <em>Button Event</em> and click on<!-- --> <strong>tag configuration</strong>.</li><li>A panel from the right side is going to slide in with a list of possible tag types to choose from. Select<!-- --> <strong>Google Analytics - Universal Analytics</strong>.</li><li>Back in the tag configuration, set the <strong>track type</strong> to <strong>event</strong>. Now you will see more fields showing up for the event data.</li><li>Let’s assign static values for <strong>event category</strong> and <strong>action</strong> and let’s make the <strong>event label</strong> populate dynamically.<br>Call the <strong>category</strong> <em>click events</em>, for example, the <strong>action</strong> is just<!-- --> <em>click</em> and for the <strong>label</strong> click on the Lego brick symbol next to it.</li><li>We want the label to always hold the text that is written on the clicked HTML element, so in case we are tracking multiple buttons, we could distinguish between them.<br>After clicking on the Lego brick, a panel is going to slide in to <strong>choose a variable</strong>.

<p>Cyber-crimes affect companies from all industries like IT, Legal, Education, Manufacturing, Finance. Healthcare is one of the most targeted since this sector relies on the perpetual exchange of big volumes of valuable data.</p>
<div><p>Amid a health crisis, a cyberattack targeting healthcare IT systems around the world takes place every three days <a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p><p>Since the beginning of the second decade of this millennium, cyber threats and data breaches increase rate has <a href="https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22026828/cyberattacks-skyrocketed-in-2018-are-you-ready-for-2019" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spiked disturbingly</a>. Cyber regulations are evolving and requiring healthcare facilities to address more than just the patient’s illnesses. Also responsible for the security of their data, they make health care information security a priority. And they are pushed to do it. Any intrusion on the integrity of internal data can have catastrophic consequences for patients and healthcare facilities.</p></div>

</figure>
<div><p>For healthcare companies, a breach of security is very costly. In this critical context, the health sector must be aware and ready to do everything possible to secure their health applications and data banks, by channeling enough technological and financial resources to them. The data collected in the health sector is particularly sensitive because most records become a significant liability when compromised. Healthcare organizations are prime targets for cybercriminals seeking to gain valuable information by exploiting vulnerable security systems. The risk of a breach is reduced by adopting security measures with mighty authentication methods, paired with employee training – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-fortinet/2019/08/27/the-importance-of-training-cybersecurity-awareness-as-a-firewall/#2693a2cd8b4b%20target=" _blank"="" rel="nofollow">a necessary follow-up action</a> that some companies tend to undermine, and, therefore, risk turning into a headline in cybersecurity news sites.</p><p>One specific area of healthcare is particularly susceptible to cyberattacks, and criminals often use it to create a breakpoint - the company’s supply chain. Because health organizations rely on multiple suppliers and external services, they support a vast network where massive data is on a constant exchange. Securing such an intense pipeline of information flow is exceptionally difficult, and hackers won’t hesitate to abuse this unfortunate fact.</p><p>In the Healthcare sector, computer systems contain sensitive data and support organizations in the delivery of quality patient services, making them a prime target for extortion attempts. Phishing, in which a cybercriminal poses as a legitimate organization or individual to entice trust, is a common form of attack. Emails have always been a possible point of entry, filled with bogus attachments and links to fake websites. Email breach is of particular concern in healthcare, as staff consistently uses emails to exchange highly valuable data. If an employee’s email login information is stolen or disclosed - including their username and password - they can be used by criminals to gain access to patient records, and based on this employee level of access, possibly leverage even further damage.</p></div>
<h2>Applications at the service of health: pay attention to the data!</h2>
<div><p>The concept of e-health is not technologically innovative. The service itself is not advanced by any means; what is innovative is the main piece of technology it uses. This tech choice consists of the provision of communicating applications allowing, here, to perform specific measures via the combined effort of a peripheral, a service platform (mainly based on cloud technologies) and a communication network <a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p><p>The security principles and techniques applicable to e-health are, therefore, very similar to those considered by suppliers of critical connected systems. The main difference is that medical devices process health data, which is among the most lucrative for cybercriminals. Personal medical records reside under the aegis of restrictive regulations. Such regulations impose special protection to guarantee the integrity of the patient’s privacy.</p><p>New black gold, all the corporate data collected and processed, defines the level of risk for the services that use this information. In the case of e-health, all present vulnerabilities and medical data leak possibilities must be eradicated. Data protection can break the integrity of private data. For example, sensitive information can circulate multiple communication channels and get exposed to a breach. Not even the doctor-patient is entirely bulletproof.</p><p>A data communication channel may temporarily break data integrity. For example, doctor-patient communication is vulnerable to data leaks, despite the security-laden non-disclosure agreement they both approve.</p><p>Of course, sensitive data can be partially <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/benefits-of-encryption-technology-for-data-protection">encrypted</a></b> or partially exposed. For example, to explain conditions or medical treatment procedures, doctors use <i>pseudonymization</i>, when communication with their patients. Doctors also use <i>anonymization</i>, when it comes to data as part of statistics or a plan to improve a specific service.</p></div>
<h2>Cybersecurity in the Healthcare sector:</h2>
<p>Healthcare organizations should ensure that they have robust security measures in place to limit the risks of email account compromise <a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, cyber security threat breaches, and other cyber security threat related incidents. These measures must cover all parameters inherent to <i>people, processes, and technologies</i>:
</p><ul><li><b>Practices and procedures</b> – Strong authentication methods, secure access to applications, systems, and data; Communication with staff and other key stakeholders’ regular updates, as well as reminders of safety behaviors and mandatory actions during safety failure;</li>
<li><b>Supplier Relationships</b> – Cybercriminals can exploit any weak link in a supply chain to gain access to a target. “The existence of strong links between companies within a healthcare ecosystem can compromise an entire ecosystem.” This is why, our latest Healthcare app project, MeTime, features a ‘close-quarters’ environment where vendors, clients and suppliers can safely exchange data while preserving privacy integrity.</li>
<li><b>Log management</b> – Healthcare facilities often use a set of proprietary applications and systems that must be linked together within an IT security framework. LogPoint’s highly flexible cybersecurity software architecture addresses this problem and has become the standard cybersecurity tool for log management in the healthcare industry <a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Some of the world’s most advanced hospitals are using our next-generation SIEM solution to protect their patient information.</li>
<li><b>Training</b> – Entry-to-service training, regular reminders, additional training for all staff, and, where appropriate, other stakeholders. Malicious activity isn’t the only activity impacting your organization. Human error - as is the case in any industry - is another risk that deserves attention. Incorrect distribution of information and inappropriate handling of sensitive data puts your organization at high risk for data loss.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware</b> – ransomware is another type of direct cybersecurity threat to the healthcare industry. While this type of attack typically cannot confirm a breach, ransomware has the potential to directly affect the privacy, integrity, and availability of critical systems. It is essential to prepare for the possibility of such an incident and harden your security policies accordingly. The recent spikes in ransomware attacks suggest it is a matter of time when online attackers will cycle toward any possible company. The best move is to expect a blow from that angle and get prepared on that front.</li></ul>
<h2>The potential role of AI for health application security</h2>
<div><p>It is no longer a secret: ensuring the security of information systems is one of the significant challenges in companies. The fight against cybercrime has experienced a small revolution in recent years, thanks to the application of artificial intelligence. Through machine learning, we can discover how threats operate and evolve and use that information for a more precise counter-measure.</p><p>The number one difficulty in cybersecurity is the realization that criminals are always one step ahead of companies: they look for security holes, that someone working for the company is likely to overlook. Also, there is the exponential and ultra-rapid development of <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/new-tech-in-ecommerce">new technologies</a></b>, particularly cloud and mobile. Hackers are quick to learn how new tech can be used to their advantage, and cybersecurity experts must keep up, keeping up with their, looking to predict, and dismantle their attempts.</p><p>Most basic security solutions focus on understanding malware and preventing infiltration. Thus, rather than being in action, they will instead react to present and incoming danger. This passive threat-response strategy requires regular updates, among other things, and their use alone proves to be insufficient. A more sophisticated cyber solution finds an ally in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machines have the intensity and relentlessness needed when battling cyber threats and are preferred tools of veteran cybersecurity experts.</p><p>AI can proactively identify and mitigate a threat even before a patch is developed and released <a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Its main advantage is its ability to relieve the human factor of tedious and time-consuming tasks, and this with a better reaction capacity in the treatment of alerts that flood computer systems daily.</p><p>AI then makes it possible to spot, analyze, and respond to cyber-attacks faster than a human. It provides an instrument which, when applied to cybersecurity, improves the efficiency and strengthens the protection of information technologies, for companies constrained by time and resources, financial or human.</p><p>It is on the processing of data between applications that AI can have a considerable impact. Robotics quickly analyzes a large amount of data from which it can spot anomalies or signal potential threats. Machines learn from a growing set of data and, over time, become more and more precise at detecting abnormalities. Today, Machine Learning finally gains the power to support human expertise in decision-making.</p><p>The future of cybersecurity is about embracing and innovating to …</p></div></div></div>

<p>AWS Glue is a fully managed serverless ETL service. It is used for ETL purposes and perhaps most importantly used in data lake eco systems. Its high level capabilities can be found in one of &nbsp;my previous post <a href="https://lijjumathew.com/etl-options-in-aws/">here</a>, but in this post I want to detail Glue Catalog, Glue Jobs and an example to illustrate a simple job.</p><h3 id="glue-catalog">Glue Catalog</h3><ul>
<li>Glue catalog is a metadata repository built automatically by crawling the datasets by Glue Crawlers. It contains tables with in a database created by crawlers and these tables can be queried via AWS Athena. Crawlers can crawl S3, RDS, Dynamo DB, Redshift and any on-prem databases that can connect via JDBC. These crawled datasets can further be used as a source or target connection in Glue while developing jobs.</li>
<li>The way crawlers work is, it has built in classifiers and runs these classifiers against the dataset in an orderly fashion. If the classifier cant recognize the data, the crawler invokes the next classifier. We can also build custom classifier and use that. These crawlers can be scheduled to scan at a regular period of time and there is an option to update the schema of the data catalog tables or ignore updates.</li>
<li>Here are some of bad experiences with crawlers that I had which you have to be careful about. One, crawling a dataset in s3 which has millions of small s3 files will take time and can be costly affair. Two, make sure data is organized in partitions and the data set that is crawled has similar files in folder. If that is not the case, say if it has 100 files of different schema, crawler can end up creating 100 tables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glue-jobs">Glue Jobs</h3><ul>
<li>Glue provides two shells, python shell and spark shell to execute a piece of code. Python shell can be used to can execute plain python code and it is a non distributed environment. The Spark Shell is a distributed environment to execute spark code written in either PySpark or Scala.</li>
<li>While using Spark shell, in addition to data frames and other constructs that spark has, Glue has a new construct called dynamic frames which requires no schema unlike data frame. Dynamic frames has few transformation functions and we can always convert dynamic frame to data frame and vice versa to use each other transformation functions.</li>
<li>Glue dev end point provides an environment to author the jobs and test it. It is an EMR cluster with all glue utilities.</li>
<li>Here are some of the important configuration parameters for Glue jobs.
<ul>
<li>Bookmark is a feature to track data that has already processed by the job in previous runs by persisting the state information. For example if we have a Glue that reads from S3 and the data is partitioned, it reads only new partition data if bookmark option is enabled(disabled by default). This feature can be used for relational sources and it keeps track of the new data by keys defined for the table.</li>
<li>DPU(Data Processing Unit) is the term used to denote the processing power allocated to the glue job. A single DPU is 4 vCpu and 16 GB of memory. Spark job requires minimum of 2 DPUs. Worker type tells what type of nodes. There is standard, G1.X(for memory intensive) and G.2X( for ML Transforms).</li>
<li>Delay notification threshold time can be set to notify (cloud watch) jobs running above the threshold time.</li>
<li>Run time parameters can be passed to job as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Features
<ul>
<li>Metrics - Glue provides spark web ui to monitor and debug the jobs. Job logs can be viewed in cloudwatch.</li>
<li>It also supports streaming ETL where we can set up continuous ingestion pipelines from sources like Kinesis, Kafka and ingest into S3 or other data stores.</li>
<li>It has a feature called workflow to orchestrate the crawlers and jobs with dependencies and triggers.</li>
<li>It also provides an interface to create and work with Sagemaker and Zepplin notebooks.</li>
<li>User defined custom python packages/modules can be used in both the shells by having it zipped and stored in S3.</li>
<li>There is a warm up time involved when you run a Glue job and it use to be around 10 mins. With Glue 2.0 it is brought down to 1 min.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pricing - You are billed only for the time the ETL job takes to run and no upfront cost for startup or shutdown time. It is charged based on number of DPU's used for the job and it is $0.44 per DPU-hour. Glue version 2.0 have a 1-minute billing duration and older versions have a 10-minute minimum billing duration. Data catalog and crawler runs have additional charges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glue-example">Glue Example</h3><p>Here is an example of Glue PySpark Job which reads from S3, filters data and writes to Dynamo Db. The job can be created from console or done normally using infrastructure as service tools like AWS cloudformation, Terraform etc. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/lijjumathew/AWS_Examples/blob/master/Glue/s3_to_dynamodb_load.py">here</a>. </p>

		<div>

			
<p>Spyware written for educational institutions to flex their muscles of control over students and their families when learning from their home computer is still, categorically, spyware.</p>



<p>Depending on your persuasion, the previous sentence sounds like either needless pedantry, or it reads like tautology. But we need to be clear on our terms.</p>



<ol><li>Educational spyware is still spyware.</li><li>Spyware is categorized as a subset of malware.</li></ol>



<p>When vulnerabilities are discovered in malware, the normal rules of <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">coordinated disclosure</a> are out of scope. Are we clear?</p>







<p>So let’s talk about Proctorio!</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anyone unfamiliar with it, Proctorio is a browser extension used to eliminate cheating through intense surveillance techniques. It records the computer screen while you take the exam to ensure you don’t look anything up. However, it’s more than that. (Thread 1/11)</p>— Cassie (@Angry_Cassie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Angry_Cassie/status/1301360994044850182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>The entire thread is unrolled <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1301360994044850182.html">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I won’t go into the details of Proctorio or why it’s terrible for (especially disadvantaged) students. Read Cassie’s Twitter thread for more context on that. Seriously. I’m not gonna be one of those guys that <em>talks over</em> women, and neither should you.</p>



<p>What I am here to talk about today is these dubious claim about the security of their product:</p>







<h2 id="zero-knowledge">Zero-Knowledge Encryption? OMGWTFBBQ!</h2>



<p>In cryptography, there are a class of algorithms called Zero-Knowledge Proofs. In a Zero-Knowledge Proof, you prove that you possess some fact without revealing any details <em>about</em> the fact.</p>



<p>It’s kind of abstract to think about (and until we’re ready to talk about Pedersen commitments, I’m just going to defer to <a href="https://openprivacy.ca/work/swisspost-scytl-evoting/">Sarah Jamie Lewis</a>), but the only thing you need to know about “Zero Knowledge” in Cryptography is that the output is a boolean (True, False).</p>



<p>You can’t use “Zero Knowledge” <em>anything</em> to encrypt. So “Zero-Knowledge Encryption” is a meaningless buzzword.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a cryptographer, I would like details on how on Earth it is using zero knowledge proofs in this situation. In all likelihood they're not doing what "zero knowledge" usually means, which quite frankly has me more worried about the security, not less.</p>— Buchberger's algorithm fan account (@SchmiegSophie) <a href="https://twitter.com/SchmiegSophie/status/1304407483658592256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>So what are they actually describing when they say Zero Knowledge Encryption?</p>







<p>Okay, so they’ve built their own key distribution system and are encrypting with AES-GCM… and shipped this in a Chrome extension. But before we get to that, look at this <strong>Daily Vulnerability Tests</strong> claim.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1204" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-04/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-04" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-04.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Bullshit.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Running Nessus (or equivalent) on a cron job isn’t meaningful metric of security. At best, it creates alert fatigue when you accidentally screw up a deployment configuration or forget to update your software for 4+ years. (Y’know, like JsZip 3.2.1, which they bundle.)</p>



<p>A dumb vulnerability scan isn’t the same thing as a routine (usually quarterly) penetration test or a code audit. And if you’re working in cryptography, <em>you better have both</em>!</p>



<h2 id="vulnerability">Timing Leaks in Proctorio’s AES-GCM Implementation</h2>



<p>If you download version 1.4.20241.1.0 of the Proctorio Chrome Extension, run <code>src/assets/J5HG.js</code> through a JS beautifier, and then look at its contents, you will quickly realize this is a JavaScript cryptography library.</p>



<p>Since the “zero knowledge” encryption they’re so proud about uses AES-GCM, let’s focus on that.</p>



<p>Proctorio’s AES-GCM implementation exists in an object called <code>dhs.mode.gcm</code>, which is mildly obfuscated, but contains the following functions:</p>



<ul><li><code>encrypt()</code> – Encrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>decrypt()</code> – Decrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>aa()</code> – GHASH block multiplication</li><li><code>j()</code> – XOR + GMAC utility function</li><li><code>O()</code> – Called by encrypt() and decrypt(); does all of the AES-CTR + GMAC fun</li></ul>



<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a>, just know this: <a href="https://cryptologie.net/article/361/breaking-https-aes-gcm-or-a-part-of-it/">Timing leaks</a> can be used to leak your GMAC key to outside applications, which completely breaks the authentication of AES-GCM and opens the door to chosen-ciphertext attacks.</p>



<p>So is their implementation of AES-GCM constant-time? Let’s take a look at <code>aa()</code>:</p>


<pre title="">aa: function(a, b) {
  var c, d, e, f, g, h = dhs.bitArray.ba;
  for (e = [0, 0, 0, 0], f = b.slice(0), c = 0; 128 &gt; c; c++) {
    for (
      (d = 0 !== (a[Math.floor(c / 32)] &amp; 1 &lt;&lt; 31 - c % 32)) &amp;&amp; (e = h(e, f)),
        g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3]),
        d = 3;
      d &gt; 0;
      d--
    )
      f[d] = f[d] &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 | (1 &amp; f[d - 1]) &lt;&lt; 31;
    f[0] &gt;&gt;&gt;= 1,
    g &amp;&amp; (f[0] ^= -520093696)
  }
  return e
},
</pre>


<p>This is a bit obtuse, but this line leaks the lowest bit of <code>f</code> with each iteration: <code>g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3])</code>.</p>



<p>Since <code>f</code> gets bitwise right-shifted 128 times, this actually leaks the bit of every value of <code>f</code> in each block multiplication, since the execution of <code>(f[0] ^= -520093696)</code> depends on whether or not <code>g</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>

So much for “zero-knowledge”!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Also, they claim to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, but this is how they generate randomness in their cryptography library.</p>

<p>(Although, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search?SearchMode=Basic&amp;Vendor=Proctorio&amp;CertificateStatus=Active&amp;ValidationYear=0">that’s probably a lie</a>.)</p>



<p>To mitigate these vulnerabilities, one needs look no further than <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#conditional-select">the guide to side-channel attacks</a> I published last month. </p>



<p>(Also, use WebCrypto to generate entropy! What the fuck.)</p>



<h2>If Proctorio is Insecure, What Should We Use Instead?</h2>



<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>



<p>Schools that demand students install spyware on their personal computers are only a step removed from domestic abusers who install stalkerware on their victims’ phones.</p>



<p>Proctorio isn’t the problem here, they’re only a symptom.</p>



<p>Schools that insist on violating the integrity and parental dominion of their students’ home computers are the problem here.</p>

<p>This project belongs to a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics">computer graphics</a> artist and researcher, Karl Sims, who is best known for using <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_systems">particle systems</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life">artificial life</a> in computer animation.</p>
<p>A harmonograph is a mechanical device that uses swinging pendulums to draw pictures, believed to be initially invented in 1844 by Scottish mathematician&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Blackburn" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh Blackburn.</a>&nbsp;This 3-pendulum rotary type of harmonograph gives a wide variety of satisfying results. It is reasonably easy to build once you’ve settled on a design and have acquired the appropriate materials and tools. Harmonograph is a great project to do with kids and can result in endless experiments creating new geometric designs.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Lumber</strong><ul><li>1 &nbsp; 3/4″ x 3’x3′ plywood for table top</li><li>4 &nbsp; 1½” x 1½” x 40″ for legs (about 14′ total)</li><li>4 &nbsp; 1½” x 8″ x 12″ for leg braces (about 4′ total)</li><li>4 &nbsp; 3/4″ x 4′ dowels for pendulums and pen lifter (make sure they are straight)</li><li>1 &nbsp; 3/4″ x 1½” x 30″ oak to cut for pendulum supports, and other</li><li>1 &nbsp; 11″ x 11″ x 1/8″ board for platform to hold paper</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hardware Store</strong><ul><li>3 &nbsp; 3/4″ x 5″ long metal pipe nipples (plumbing section)</li><li>3 &nbsp; 3/4″ to 1″ metal pipe bushings</li><li>3 &nbsp; 1″ steel clamps</li><li>4 &nbsp; 1¼” x 4″ metal plates (or 2&nbsp; 1¼” x 8″ plates cut in half)</li><li>1 &nbsp; large metal washer with 2½” outer diameter, 1″ inner diameter, for gimbal</li><li>1 &nbsp; screw-eye for pen lifter</li><li>various drill bits: 3″ circular, 3/4″, 1/8″, etc.</li><li>various #10 screws (1″, 1¼”, 1½”, 1¾”, 2″, 3″)</li><li>a few thin nails</li><li>tools: drill, saw, hammer, tape measure, file, sand paper, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sporting goods store:</strong><ul><li>2½ lb weights with 1″ hole, at least 8 of them</li></ul></li><li><strong>Art supplies store</strong>:<ul><li>2 &nbsp; 1/2″ x 1/4″ x 30″ balsa (and maybe a spare or two)</li><li>various pens such as: Silver Uni-Ball GEL Impact, and Staedtler Triplus Rollerball</li><li>some string and rubber bands</li><li>paper, 8½” x 11″ (or 9″ x 12″) some black, some white</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2>STEP 1</h2>
<p><strong>Table.</strong> Start by building a sturdy table. This table-top is a 3’x3′ square of 3/4″ thick plywood. The legs are 1½” x 1½” square and about 37″ long, with triangular braces cut from 1½” x 8″x 12″ wooden pieces. The legs are splayed out slightly to give the table strength and allow the rotary pendulum to swing without hitting a leg.</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> screw and/or glue the braces to the legs first, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or circular saw. Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37″.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> if you want to fit the table through doorways without taking off the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.</p></div>

<figcaption><strong>Holes for Pendulums</strong>. Drill 3 holes of 3″ diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to hang through. The rotary pendulum’s hole should be centered in a corner about 8″ from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two holes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8″ from the common side, and 3″ from the other. You’ll need a particular sizeable circular drill bit for this. Alternatively, you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a wider opening with a jigsaw.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Plates to support pendulums</strong>. Mount two metal plates (about 1¼” x 4″) on the sides of the two lateral pendulum holes and drill a small indentation in each plate’s center. <p><strong>Tip:</strong> first, start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit (such as 1/8″) and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4″). Be careful not to drill all the way through. Tip: unless you have a good drill press, it may be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after you create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be harder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the indentations.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Pendulums.</strong> The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½” outer and 1″ inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes.<p>Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the picture from below, note the oak blocks (3/4″ x 1½” x 5″) supporting the two screws (1¾” #10) protruding upwards and diagonally. File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed, so the pendulum doesn’t hit them when it swings. Likewise, file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn’t hit the table when swinging.</p></figcaption></figure>

</figure></li></ul><figcaption><strong>Gimbal.</strong> The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½” outer and 1″ inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes. <p>Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the view from below, note the oak blocks (3/4″ x 1½” x 5″) supporting the two screws (1¾” #10) protruding upwards and diagonally. File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed so the pendulum doesn’t hit them when it swings. Likewise file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn’t hit the table when swinging.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Weights.</strong> 2½ lb lifting weights from a sporting goods store work well, but typically have a 1″ interior hole. You can stack several weights and slide them together onto the 3/4″ pendulum dowel by using a 5″ long 3/4″ metal pipe nipple, with a 3/4″ to 1″ bushing screwed onto the lower end. A 1″ steel clamp attached to the dowel fixes the weights from sliding off and allows easy adjustment of the weight’s height to give different swinging frequencies.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Paper Platform. </strong>Cut about 1″ off the top of the rotary pendulum dowel, so it is slightly lower than the other two. Then mount an 11″x11″ square of thin 1/8″ board to the top of this pendulum, using a small oak block glued to it for support, with a 3/4″ hole for the dowel. Wrap some tape around the dowel’s top to get a tight fit, or glue it on.<p>*** Use two rubber bands, or some clips, to hold the paper in place on the platform. If the form slips on the platform, spray a thin layer of temporary adhesive on the platform to make it slightly sticky.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Arms.</strong> Connect a 30″ long balsa stick to the top of each lateral pendulum using a thin nail. Bend the nail back and forth a little in the balsa to allow the arm to rotate smoothly and move up and down slightly. The nail hole will slowly loosen further during use.<p>To make a simple pen-holder, drill a 1/2″ hole on the end of one arm, and cut about 4″ down the arm’s center to make a clothes-pin like a device. Alternatively, glue a real clothes-pin to the end of one of the arms. Pictures of both versions are shown.</p><p>Finally, attach the two arms with a doubled-over rubber band, as shown.</p><p>Note that if you plan to use your harmonograph regularly, such as in a museum setting, a more robust solution for these arms that won’t wear as quickly might be necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;An alternate version of the arm-pendulum connection is shown to the right that uses a magnetic ball joint instead of the simple nail method above. Glue one 3/8″ spherical magnet to the arm (making sure the N/S alignment is horizontal by connecting a second magnet). File a hole in the side of a nylon cylinder (1″ height, 1/2″ outer and 3/8″ inner diameter) and use smaller cylinders (3/8″ outer diameter) to hold another magnet inside that can rotate freely. Then glue the cylinder to the top of the pendulum.</p></figcaption></figure>

</figure></li></ul><figcaption><strong>Pen Lifter.</strong> It is convenient to raise and lower the pen gently without disturbing the motion of the pendulums. To do this, insert a 30″ pole into a hole near the center of the table, just far enough from the paper platform that it won’t be hit by it (about 12″ from the rotary pendulum hole). Attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support. Tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Step 10</h2>
<p><strong>Pens.</strong> Experiment with pens and markers of various types and colors. Generally, wide pens or thin markers seem to work best. Here are some I’ve had good luck with so far:</p>
<ul><li>Uniball GEL Impact in Silver, use on black or dark paper.</li><li>Staedtler Triplus Rollerball Pens (.4mm) in various colors</li><li>Pigma Graphic 1 (1.0mm) in black</li><li>Sakura Identi Pen in black, purple, etc.</li></ul>
<p>but many other types of pens may also work well.</p>
<h2>Adjustments</h2>
<p><strong>Weight Height</strong>. Adjust a pendulum’s weight height to change its swinging frequency. The frequency of a pendulum varies with the inverse of the square root of its length, so to swing twice as fast, the length between the fulcrum and its center-of-mass would need to be 1/4 of the original length (which may not be practical with this harmonograph). For a 3:2 or 4:3 frequency increase, the weights would be raised around 19″ or 15″ respectively, although you should probably do some timing tests to find and mark these heights experimentally.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Amount</strong>. Add more weight to a pendulum to counteract friction and make the swinging last longer. I’ve found that 5 lb (2 x 2½) on the rotary pendulum, and 7½ lb (3 x 2½) on the other two works reasonably well. Note that adding more weight does not generally change the frequency of the pendulum.</p>
<p><strong>Phase and Amplitude</strong>. Each time you swing the pendulums to make a new drawing, each pendulum’s relative phases, and amplitudes will vary. Try somewhere the rotary pendulum, and the lateral pendulums are initially making circles in the same or opposite directions. Try somewhere the lateral pendulums are initially swinging in phase to make a diagonal line.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>Two-pendulum results</strong>. To simplify things, you can lock …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></main></div></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>There's something I have to get off my chest. If you really need to, just read the TLDR and listen to the Justin Bieber parody posted below. If you’re confused by the lingo, the rest of the post will fill in any gaps.</p><div><p>TL;DR: Benchmarketing, the practice of using benchmarks for marketing, is bad. Consumers should run their own benchmarks and ideally open-source them instead of relying on an internal and biased report.</p><p>Enjoy the song I wrote about this silly practice.</p></div><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSy8V-R0_Zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>For the longest time, I have wondered what is the point of corporations, specifically in the database sectors, running their own benchmarks. Would a company ever have any incentive to post results from a benchmark that didn't show its own system winning in at least the majority of cases? I understand that these benchmarks have become part of the furniture we come to expect to see when visiting any hot new database's website. I doubt anybody in the public domain gains much insight out of these results, to begin with, at least nothing they weren't expecting to see. </p><p>Now to be clear, I am in no way indicating that companies running their own internal benchmarks to analyze their own performance in comparison to their competitors is a bad thing. It’s when they take those results and intentionally skew the methods or data from these benchmarks for sales or marketing purposes that is the problem we’re discussing here. Vendors that take part in the practice, not only use these benchmarks to show their systems succeeding a little but rather perversely taint their methodology with settings, caching, and other performance enhancements, while leaving their competition’s settings untouched. </p><p>This should be obvious that this is NOT what benchmarking is about! If you read about the history of the <a href="http://www.tpc.org/information/about/history5.asp">Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)</a> you come to understand that this is the very wrongdoing that the council was created to address. But like with any proxy involving measurements, the measurements are inherently pliable.</p><blockquote>By the spring of 1991, the TPC was clearly a success. Dozens of companies were running multiple TPC-A and TPC-B results. Not surprisingly, these companies wanted to capitalize on the TPC's cachet and leverage the investment they had made in TPC benchmarking. Several companies launched aggressive advertising and public relations campaigns based around their TPC results. In many ways, this was exactly why the TPC was created: to provide objective measures of performance. What was wrong, therefore, with companies wanting to brag about their good results? What was wrong is that there was often a large gap between the objective benchmark results and their benchmark marketing claims--this gap, over the years, has been dubbed "benchmarketing." So the TPC was faced with an ironic situation. It had poured an enormous amount of time and energy into creating a good benchmark and even a good benchmark review process. However, the TPC had no means to control how those results were used once they were approved. The resulting problems generated intense debates within the TPC.</blockquote><p>This benchmarketing ultimately fails the clients that these companies are marketing to. It demonstrates not only a lack of care for addressing the users' actual pain but a lack of respect by intentionally pulling the wool over their eyes simply in an attempt to mask that their performance isn't up to par with their competitors. <strong>This leads to consumers not being able to make informed decisions as most of our decisions are made from gut instincts and human emotion which these benchmarks aim to manipulate.</strong></p><p>If you’re not sure exactly how a company would pull this off, an example of might be that database A enables using a cost-based optimizer that requires precomputing statistics about different tables involved in the computation, while database B is running a query against this table without any type of stats based optimization made available to it. Database A will clearly dominate as now it can reorder joins and apply better execution plans while database B is going to go with the simplest plan and run much slower in most scenarios. The company whose product depends on database A will then hone in on the numerical outcomes of this report. Even if they're decent enough to report the methods they skewed to get these results, they bury it within their report and focus on advertising the outcome of what would otherwise be considered an absurd comparison. Companies will even go as far as to say that their competition's database wasn't straight forward to configure when they were setting up optimizations. If you're not capable of understanding how to make equivalent changes to both systems, well then I guess you don't get to run that comparison until you figure it out. &nbsp;</p><p>Many think that consumers are not susceptible to such attacks and would be able to see right through this scheme, but these reports appeal to any of us when we don't have the necessity or resources to thoroughly examine all the data. Many times we have to take cues from our gut when a decision needs to be made and the time to make it is constrained by our time and other business needs. We see this type of phenomenon described in the book, <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman. To briefly summarize the model they use, there are two modes that humans use when they reason about their decisions, System 1 and System 2.</p><blockquote>Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine — usually.</blockquote><p>No surprise, that’s usually the part where we get into trouble. While we like to think that we are generally thinking in the logical System 2 mode, we don't have time or energy to live in this space for long periods throughout the day and we find ourselves very reliant on System 1 for much of our decision making.</p><blockquote>The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions.</blockquote><p>This is why benchmarketing can be so dangerous because it is so effective at manipulating our belief in claims that simply aren't true. These decisions affect how your architecture will unfold, your time-to-value, and lost hours for your team and customers. It makes having these systems that fairly compare the performance and merits of two systems all-the-more paramount.</p><figure><img src="http://bitsondata.dev/content/images/2020/09/significant.png" alt=""><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">https://xkcd.com/882/</a></figcaption></figure><p>So why am I talking about this now?</p><p>I have become a pretty big fanboy of a <a href="https://prestosql.io/">Presto</a>, a distributed query engine that runs interactive queries from many sources. I have witnessed firsthand how fast a cluster of Presto nodes are able to process through a huge amount of data at blindingly fast speeds. When you dive into how these speeds are achieved you find that this project is an incredible modern feat of solid engineering that makes interactive analysis over petabytes of data a reality. Going into all the reasons I like this project would be too tangential but it fuels the fire for why I believe this message needs to be heard.</p><p>Recently there was a "benchmark" that came out comparing the performance of a commercial competitor and Presto open-source and enterprise versions, touting performance improvements over Presto by an amount that would have been called out as too high in a CSI episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU">&lt;insert canonical csi clip here&gt;</a>. If you need to find out what I’m talking about, simply google "presto benchmark 3000" and you will find the benchmark along with plenty of other hype they've generated around these "findings". <a href="https://blog.yugabyte.com/yugabytedb-vs-cockroachdb-bringing-truth-to-performance-benchmark-claims-part-1/">Presto isn't the only system in the data space to come under similar types of attacks.</a> It makes sense too, as this type of technical peacocking is common as it successfully gains attention. </p><p>Luckily, as more companies strive to become transparent and associate themselves with open-source efforts, we are starting to see a relatively new pattern of open-source efforts emerge. Typically, you're used to hearing about open-source within the context of software projects maintained by open-source communities. We are now arriving at the age of any noun being able to be used in an open-source framework. There is open-source music, open-source education, and even open-source data. So why not reach a point where open-source benchmarking through consumer collaboration is a thing. This is not just for the sake of the consumers of these technologies who simply want to have more data to inform their design choices to better serve their clients, it's also unfortunate that this affects developer communities that are putting in a lot of hard work on these projects, only to have that hard work get berated unintelligibly by the likes of some corporate status competition.</p><p>Now I'm clearly a little biased when I tell you that I think Presto is currently the best analytics engine on the market today. When I say this, you really should be skeptical too. Really, I encourage it. You should verify in some way beyond a shadow of a doubt that:</p><p> &nbsp;1. Any TPC or other benchmarks are validated and no "magic" was used to improve their performance.</p><figure></figure><p> &nbsp;2. using your own use cases to make sure the system you choose is going to meet the needs of your particular use case.<br></p><p>While this may seem like a lot of work, with cloud infrastructure and simplicity of deploying different …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

		<div>
		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>4</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>I’m currently working on a series of episodes for a Podcast I’ll be publishing soon. The Podcast will be in Italian and I wanted to make sure to publish the episode transcripts together with the audio episodes.</p>



<p>The idea of manually typing all the episodes text wasn’t really appealing to me so I started looking around.</p>



<h2>What are the tools out there?</h2>



<p>From a quick Google search, it seems that some companies are offering a mix of automated and human-driven transcription services.</p>



<p>I wasn’t really interested in that for now. I was, of course, just interested in consuming an API I could push my audio to and get back some text in a reasonable amount of time.</p>



<p>For this reason, I started looking for <em>speech-to-text</em> APIs and, of course, the usual suspects figured among the first results.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text">IBM Watson Speech-to-Text</a></li><li><a href="https://www.speechmatics.co/">SpeechMatics</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</a></li></ul>



<p>To be quite honest, I didn’t spend too much time investigating the solutions above. I probably spent more time reading about them to write this blog post.</p>



<p>I decided to go with Google Cloud because I’ve never used GCP before and wanted to give it a try. Additionally, the documentation for it seemed quite straightforward, as well as the support for Italian as language to transcribe from (the podcast is in Italian). I also had a few free credits available because I’ve never used GCP for personal use before.</p>



<h2>Setting up</h2>



<p>If you want to try transcribing your episodes too, follow this quick setup guide to get started.</p>



<p>Head over to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> and set up an account. Make sure you create a project and enable the Speech-to-Text API. If you forget to do so <code>gcloud</code> will be able to take care of that for you, later.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="509" height="99" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59.png" alt="Google Cloud Speech-to-Text" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59.png 509w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"><figcaption>Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Second thing I did was installing <code><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts">gcloud</a></code>, the CLI Google Cloud provides for interacting with the APIs. This time I was only interested in testing the API so it seemed to me that this tool was the only way to get started quickly.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s not much you can do from the Google Cloud Web Console if you want to deal with Speech-to-Text APIs.</p>



<h3>Get your file ready for transcription</h3>



<p>Sampling rate for your audio file should be at least 16 kHz for better results. Additionally, GCP recommends a lossless codec. I only had an mp3 of my episode handy at the time so I gave it a try anyway and it worked well enough.</p>



<p><strong>Make sure you know the sample rate of your file, though, because specifying a wrong one might lead to poor results.</strong></p>



<p>You can usually verify the sample rate by getting info on your file from your Mac’s Finder:</p>







<p>You can read more about the recommended settings on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/best-practices">Best Practices</a> section.</p>



<h3>Upload your episode to the bucket</h3>



<p>GCP needs your file to be available from a Storage Bucket so, go ahead and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets">create one</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cloud.google.com/storage/images/create-bucket.png" alt=""><figcaption>Storage Bucket creation example</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll be able to upload your episode from there.</p>



<h2>Time to transcribe</h2>



<p>Once you have your episode file up there in the cloud go back to your local machine terminal were you have configured the <code>gcloud</code> tool.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1024x175.png" alt="" width="580" height="99" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1024x175.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-300x51.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-768x131.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1536x263.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>Gcloud used to trigger the speech-to-text transcription</figcaption></figure>



<p>If your episode lasts longer than 60 seconds (😬) you’ll want to use <code>recognize-long-running</code> and most likely specify <code>--async</code>. </p>



<p>As I said before, make sure you specify the right <code>--sample-rate</code>: in my case 44100. This will help GCP transcribe your file with better results.</p>



<p>The <code>--async</code> switch creates a long-running asynchronous operation. It took around 5 minutes for me to have the operation complete. </p>



<p>Oddly, I wasn’t able to find any reference to the asynchronous operation from my Google Cloud Console. So, if you want to be able to know what happened to your transcription job, make sure you take note of the operation identifier. You’ll need it to query the <code>speech operations</code> API for information about your transcription job.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="268" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon2-1024x268.png" alt="" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon2-1024x268.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon2-300x79.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon2-768x201.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon2-1536x402.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon2.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The speech operation metadata</figcaption></figure>



<h2>The transcribed data</h2>



<p>Once your transcription operation is complete the <code>describe</code> command will return the transcript excerpts, together with the confidence rate.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1024x641.png" alt="" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1024x641.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-300x188.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-768x481.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1536x962.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The speech transcript excerpt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I wasn’t particularly interested in the <code>confidence</code> rate, I only wanted a big blob of text to be able to review and use for SEO purposes as well as to be able to include it with the episode. For this reason, <strong><em>jq to the resque!</em></strong></p>



<p>I love <code><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a></code>, you can achieve so much with when it comes to manipulate JSON.</p>



<p>In my case, I only wanted to concatenate all the <code>transcript</code> fields and save them to a file. Here’s how I did:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ ./bin/gcloud ml speech operations describe &lt;your-transcription-operation-id&gt; | jq '.response.results[].alternatives[].transcript' &gt; my-transcript.txt</pre>



<p>And that’s it!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I thought of sharing the steps above because they’ve been useful to me in producing the transcripts. I think GCP Speech-to-Text works quite well with Italian but, of course, the transcript is not suitable to be used as it is, unless your accent is perfect. Mine wasn’t 😅.</p>

<h2 id="cs-294-165-fall-2020-syllabus-fall20-syllabus">CS 294-165 - Fall 2020 (<a href="https://www.sketchingbigdata.org/fall20/syllabus">Syllabus</a>)</h2>

<p><strong><strong>Sketching algorithms</strong></strong> compress data in a way that is still useful for answering some pre-specified family of queries, possibly across datasets by comparing sketches. This course will cover mathematically rigorous models for developing such algorithms, as well as some provable limitations of algorithms operating in those models. Some topics covered include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Streaming algorithms.</strong> Compute useful statistics over a dataset making only one pass over it, while using little memory.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dimensionality reduction.</strong> General techniques and impossibility results for reducing data dimension while still preserving geometric structure.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Randomized linear algebra.</strong> Algorithms for big matrices (e.g. a user/product rating matrix for Netflix or Amazon). Regression, low rank approximation, clustering, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Compressed sensing.</strong> Recovery of (approximately) sparse signals based on few linear measurements.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a graduate course, though there may be room for a limited number of advanced undergraduate students satisfying the following prerequisites: mathematical maturity and comfort with algorithms (e.g. CS 170), discrete probability, and linear algebra.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5e842a035e87b661d8bf062f"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c44372ffee113b1df651"><div><p>“Did you see that Stripe’s CMO is out?” a founder asked one day from the desk behind me.</p><p>Though I’d heard the news, the question had me curious for two reasons: First, I was two months into my own role as head of marketing of a fast-growing fintech startup and curious what my boss thought about the topic. Second, I had closely followed the woman in question and considered her a terrific marketer.</p><p>“It’s only been a year,” he continued. “She must’ve been bad.”<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Revolving door</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This exchange sticks with me years later because it’s emblematic of the mentality some technical founders hold about the role of marketing.</p><p>The thinking goes: Founders build great products that sell themselves through the power of network effects. When the need arises down the road, the company will hire a proven marketing professional to start a department from scratch while everyone’s at a full sprint. If it doesn’t work out…<em>she must’ve been bad</em>.</p><p>In fact, brief tenures and abrupt departures of CMOs have become the norm in Silicon Valley.<strong> </strong>By my count, the tenures of Robinhood’s first <em>three</em> CMOs combined add up to two years; Wealthfront’s first CMO lasted a year and half; and Intercom’s and Affirm’s first CMOs were both out in less than a year. At Dropbox, our first CMO (who I found to be a fantastic leader and marketer) stayed on for just over a year…</p><p>These marketers weren’t all “bad.” Most of them have stellar reputations, in fact. So what’s really going on?</p><p><strong>Founder mentality</strong></p><p>In Silicon Valley, marketing isn’t important—until it is.</p><p>Founders often disregard marketing for as long as possible, convincing themselves it’s “fluff.” A product manager can probably handle things like customer research, product positioning, and the external components of a product launch, and then hand them off to sales, right? After all, he has an MBA. :)</p><p>This works well enough in the early stages, but then problems emerge: Customer-facing team members struggle to stick to a consistent message in the market; information isn’t flowing between customers and product teams; taking turns managing the company Twitter account isn’t working; and the founders have to manage the press alias.</p><p>At the same time, the internal demand for marketing grows: Engineering needs better market insights; product needs successful launches; sales needs more compelling materials; executives need external comms support; HR needs help with recruiting and retention; and customer success needs to scale and automate a lot of customer comms.</p><p>Finally, something happens. The company gets ensnared in a PR crisis, needs to expand to new markets, or faces new competition. If only the company had better brand equity, visibility, or public sentiment, executives could stay focused on what’s important.</p><p>At this point, founders “give in” and kick off the search for a head of marketing to build the function.</p><p><strong>‘Without a penny spent on marketing’</strong></p><p>When recruiting for their first head of marketing, founders will sometimes declare enthusiastically, “Look how far we’ve gotten—and without a penny spent on marketing!”&nbsp;</p><p>I tell them this is analogous to walking into a dentist’s office and proclaiming, “Look how great my teeth look—and without a day of brushing! Do you want to be my first dentist?” Yuck.</p><p>If you didn’t believe in marketing for years, you probably aren’t set up for the function to succeed in the first place. Experienced marketers know this.&nbsp;</p><p>If they’ve done the job before, a candidate will know they’ll be juggling four jobs at the same time:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Job 1: Recruit and manage a team;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Job 2: Define what marketing means at the company and educate the rest of the team;</p></li><li><p>Job 3: Help other departments succeed and scale; and</p></li><li><p>Job 4: Define the brand and tell stories to move the brand forward.</p></li></ul><p>They also know they’ll be stepping into a mess and answering to executives who expect quick results. What’s more, with no team in place, they’ll be responsible for day-to-day activities they’ve been delegating for years (writing copy, setting up marketing dashboards, etc.)&nbsp;</p><p>Do they really want to start at the beginning, with no resources?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First hire a ‘super IC’ (or two)</strong></p><p>Instead of following this failed playbook, I advise startups to think about marketing much earlier in the process and begin laying the foundation that a future leader can build on.</p><p>Set up a small team of one or two strong individual contributors to take on marketing duties. These should be generalists capable of handling a variety of marketing tasks (maybe consider making them <a href="https://helenmin.com/blog/product-marketing">product marketing managers</a>). Have them set up basic infrastructure like a marketing automation tool that connects to your CRM and Google Analytics for your website and blog. Connect them to other departments to begin building websites optimized for conversions, developing simple campaigns, drafting brand messaging, and so on.</p><p>This is a win for the founder, who learns the different marketing functions much earlier in the process. It’s a win for the business generalist, who can find their passion while making an impact at the company. It’s a win for the future head of marketing, because someone will have already done some trial-and-error and gotten the marketing function off the ground. And it’s a win for the recruiter, because the job’s more attractive with someone already on the team cranking.</p><p>These super ICs won’t do all the jobs of a marketing head. They won’t recruit or necessarily even lead. But you’ll have people who understand marketing, speak the language, and can run experiments.</p><p><strong>Self-fulfilling prophecy</strong></p><p>Like NFL coaches, heads of marketing experience a lot of turnover. Because marketing initiatives are often hard to measure and roles aren’t customer-facing, removing a marketing lead is a quick and easy lever for a founder to pull at the first signs of things not working out.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy develops, where marketers <em>assume</em> they’ll only last a year and start making decisions based on that belief. Knowing time is limited, they get over-ambitious and move too fast or focus on things that will pad their resume rather than strategic priorities. After a year or two, they’re off to another company and the startup is back at square one. </p><p>This is bad for startups! Scarred by their experience dealing with a first head of marketing departure, many founders put off hiring a new lead for a while—sometimes leaving the company even worse off than before the head of marketing joined.</p><p><strong>A checklist&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To avoid this fate for your company, use the following checklist to determine if you’re ready for a marketing head:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Do you have budget, headcount, and recruiting bandwidth to help a new marketing leader build their team?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Do you have a clear understanding of your growth model and where marketing efforts can uniquely impact growth?&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><em>Do you have buy-in from engineering and design leadership to support marketing experiments and campaigns?&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><em>Do you have the patience to allow time for experimentation and some fails before big wins?</em></p></li></ul><p>If you answer “yes” to (most of) these questions, congratulations—you’re ready to hire your first marketing head. Good luck!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of cybersecurity advice that comes up time and time again is to use a VPN. VPNs, or virtual private networks, encrypt the internet traffic between you and your VPN provider, securing data from your internet provider and local network as well as hiding your IP address. Through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uE7kFcJ_Pk">clever marketing</a>, VPN providers position themselves as an all in one tool to secure yourself online. However, the reality is a lot more complicated.</p><h2>VPNs can sell your data</h2><p>Privacy wise, all a VPN does is shift who you trust with your data. Normally, you would trust your internet provider, like Comcast or AT&amp;T, to not intercept or change any of your data packets. When you use a VPN, that traffic is encrypted through your local internet provider and released at the VPNs servers. This means that your VPN provider could intercept or track your connections. Most VPNs will claim that they do not do this, citing that they have no logging policies. However, VPNs <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/">have lied about this policy</a> before.</p><p>Free VPNs are especially prone to these shady business practices, as they have to pay for their servers somehow. For example, popular free VPN Hotspot Shield was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/ftc-must-scrutinize-hotspot-shield-over-alleged-traffic-interception-group-says/">caught injecting affiliate links into their users traffic</a>. Generally, it's a good idea to avoid most free VPNs and do your research before using any VPN, even if it's paid.</p><h2>VPNs don’t make you anonymous</h2><p>While VPNs do change your public IP address, this isn’t as helpful as you might think. Most IP addresses are shared between multiple people or devices anyway, so services don’t rely on it much for tracking. However, there are lots of other factors that companies use to track you. This includes the cookies in your browser and what accounts you are logged in to, but also many other factors outside of your control such as your user agent or browser fingerprint. Browser fingerprinting, for example, uses factors such as your device, screen size, plugins, and other information about your computer to uniquely identify you. To see this in action, you can visit a site like <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> to see how unique your browser is to trackers.</p><h2>VPNs don’t make you (that much) more secure</h2><p>VPNs do secure your traffic from your local network, but we already have technologies that do that for us. HTTPS, the padlock in your browser, means that content is encrypted between your computer and the website you are connected to. This makes it really hard for someone to intercept or view the site you are looking at. The most an onlooker would be able to see is the domain name you are connected to, but they wouldn't be able to see the exact page or content you are looking at. Generally, for most people, this should be enough and VPNs wouldn't add many security benefits - especially if the VPN is sketchy itself.</p><h2>So why would I use a VPN?</h2><p>While VPNs aren't needed for most people, there are definitely scenarios in which they are useful. If you are trying to access content that is region restricted, VPNs are useful tools to bypass geoblocks. VPNs are also useful for bypassing restrictive firewalls, or add extra security if you are connected to a public Wi-Fi network. However, before you use a VPN, make sure you do your research about which VPNs are trustworthy and won't sell your data.</p><h2>So how do I secure myself online?</h2><p>The most important way to secure yourself online is simply to follow basic cyber hygiene habits. Use unique passwords for each site with a password manager, don’t click on links in suspicious emails or websites, always keep your software up to date. As internet security and privacy becomes more popular, major VPN companies are going to grow and get more popular. However if you follow basic cyber hygiene habits, your cybersecurity posture will be stronger than if you just used VPN companies.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Everything has a name: a child, a pet, cars, and places. It’s how we befriend subjects and objects and it’s how we recall identifiers. But, naming a brand can be a painful process. It can take a long time and sometimes, it seems to never really come together. In order to take the pressure off of finding the perfect name it’s helpful to remember that businesses create brands, not vice versa. Think <em>Mountain Dew</em> (sounds cumbersome), <em>Starbucks</em> (sounds unrelated) and <em>Virgin</em> (sounds like a lack of experience), <em>The Boring Company</em> (sounds negative), <em>Slack</em> (sounds like the opposite of what it does). Attributed meaning and feelings build in the years after naming.</strong></p>



<hr>







<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="brand-names-in-context">Brand Names in Context</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>First and foremost, a name doesn’t come alone. There will be contextual elements like a tagline, a logo, a color palette that are used on a variety of components, like the top visual on a website, or a headline on an ad. All of those can be filled with words and visuals that reflect a company’s strategy. A name, however, is a central and the longest-standing of all brand components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get help from a naming professional or find a name yourself. The following cornerstones make for a process and provide for a good checklist.</p>
</div>



<div>
<p>The most important aspects of your strategy, <em>your product</em> (<a href="https://mmarchny.com/creative-strategy-branding-part-1-company/">what it is</a>), <em>what does it stand for</em> (<a href="https://mmarchny.com/creative-strategy-branding-part-4-positioning/">positioning</a>), <em>who’s it for</em> (<a href="https://mmarchny.com/creative-strategy-branding-part-2-target-market/">target market</a>), need to get across clearly in the most important brand modules: the name, the logo and a tagline.</p>



<p>The more unknown the company or product, the more direct those aspects need to be laid out in branding communications.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>



<p>Name: Twitter (product: chatter)</p>



<p>Tagline: It’s what’s happening. (positioning: real and now)</p>



<p>Meta description: From breaking news and entertainment to sports and politics, get the full story with all the live commentary. (target market: for news and entertainment readers that look for a variety of opinions)</p>
</div>



<div>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>



<p>Name: Starbucks, originally known as Starbucks Coffee Company (product: coffee)</p>



<p>Tagline: More than just great coffee. (positioning: quality coffee, snacks and atmosphere)</p>



<p>Visuals and additional copy: Employee photos are in the foreground. Alongside copy that describes values: “not only celebrated coffee but also connection.

<h2 id="domain-availability">Domain Availability&nbsp;</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>At the beginning of the naming process, looking up domains that are available can be helpful. It’ll help find competitors as well. If the domain name is not available, an additional industry identifier can be pre or appended, like –books for a bookstore or –foods or eat– for any food-related brands. Think <em>zolabooks.com</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Broad terms like <em>Solutions</em> should be avoided due to lack of meaning (words that can be used by everybody don’t add meaning). Dot-com for companies or dot-org domains for nonprofits remain strongest and are preferred in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<h2 id="acronyms-founder-names">Acronyms and Founders’ Names</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Usually, good names are shorter, otherwise they’ll get abbreviated naturally later into an acronym. Think <em>KFC, A.T. &amp; T. and P&amp;G</em>. A name sometimes consists of two or three compound words—the words themselves and their first letters need to make a good combination. <em>SS</em> will always have a bad connotation in some countries. No matter how hard one tries to prohibit the usage of monograms, eventually, these letter combos will make their way into file names, into favicons or other collapsed logo versions, into code, especially used when the product is a technical product where truncated versions occur naturally.</p>



<p><strong>B2C brands focus on names that show personality, culture and positioning.</strong> Common names are <em>Apple</em> (easy and obtainable), <em>Nike and Audi</em>. Brand names do not have to be connected to the actual product, although they certainly can be (think <em>Netflix and Aesop</em>), but an appendix can be added that has the potential to be dropped when a brand is well-known. Think <em>Starbucks Coffee Company vs. Starbucks</em>. Short/ fun/ cool/ approachable/ memorable/ indicative trumps logical and longer. Think <em>Hulu, Kodak, Etsy, Mars, 3M, Nest and Sony.</em></p>
</div>



<div>
<p>Avoid a descriptive category or common industry-specific keyword name for a company name. Competitors will pick similar ones which will not only make your brand blend in but the chance to position the company is wasted. Read the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/famous-names">NYT story</a> on EasyMail, MegaMail, and ProMail. Also, descriptive names are harder to trademark and can be impossible to find through Google search.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Founders’ names</strong> are considered functional names. Think <em>Dell, Ford and Colgate.</em> Carrying personality and positioning from the start is not a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>B2B brands</strong> often have a more descriptive name; they will get abbreviated and that’s okay. Think <em>UPS, IBM, AWS.</em> The one thing that’s important for B to B names is that they need to have the potential to sound big, or at least not small and definitely not limiting in what services the company sells. <a href="http://blue/">Bluecore</a>’s first name was TriggerMail. Triggering an email was how the company started out but other products were added on later.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="length-industry-fit-pronunciation"><strong><strong>Length, Industry Fit, Pronunciation</strong></strong></h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Longer names, a group of names and compounds naturally have a tendency to sound smaller unless they include (read: <em>own</em>) an important branch or location of the industry. Think <em>Whole Foods, Natural History Museum, American Airlines</em>.</p>



<p>A name should fit broadly into the field of its peers (read: <em>stand out the right way</em>). It should be easy to remember, have no complicated spelling (or a well-considered or user-tested alternative spelling), be pronounceable in one way only* and it should be ownable within its industry. A domain check and a search through the <a href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/">trademark database</a> will be of help, but consulting a trademark lawyer who reviews usage in specific categories, states, national and international use, is money well-invested.</p>
</div>



<p><em>* The former car brand Daewoo turned their unpronounceable name into an ad campaign in 1995. Fage yoghurt still needs to have its pronunciation printed on its packaging. Other names that were created before being tested internationally are Huawei, Renault, Tag Heuer and Moschino. Two Princeton University psychologists have found in a </em><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2006/05/29/study-stock-performance-tied-ease-pronouncing-companys-name"><em>2006 study</em></a><em> that “people are more likely to purchase newly offered stocks that have easily pronounced names.”</em></p>

<h2 id="naming-trends">Trends</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>Different times, different constraints, different trends. For internet companies, the <em>-ster</em> <em>(Napster, Friendster)</em> started in 2001, <em>“My”</em> happened in 2005 (Myspace), and <em>-fy/ -ly/ -y</em> spiked in 2010 <em>(Bitly, Artsy and Weebly). </em>Vowel-dropping for easier trademarking and domain availability was early to mid 2000’s <em>(Flickr, Tumblr, Unbxd, Scribd).</em> The random couple sandwich names mostly found in the fashion industry spiked in 2010. Think <em>Rag &amp; Bone, Kit and Ace, Boll &amp; Branch.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Generally, the naming of products (as opposed to the naming of companies) can be more trendy versus classy because they evolve with the market or they have room for a revamp over time.</p>

<p>
<h2 id="spelling-spaces-hyphens"><strong>Spelling, Spaces, Hyphens</strong></h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>As for many things, <em>classy</em> wins in the long run because it never goes out of style.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Spelling of a brand name within text:</em> </p>



<p>An abbreviated company name should be spelled in all caps, not lowercase. A regular name should be spelled together, first letter capitalized. A name should be separated by space or by hyphen if it consists of multiple words, capitalizing each first letter. When compound words are spelled together, there must be only one way to pronounce the compound, if not, it needs separation. A good test for spelling is to insert the name into long- and short-form copy: in the middle of a sentence, at the beginning of a sentence, into a bulleted list and into a signature. The name needs to have a consistent appearance across all applications and not look awkward (think an all lowercase brand name at the beginning of a sentence).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>



<div>
<p><em>Spelling within a logo mark:</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Option 1 “Friendly”:</strong> lowercase spelling in logos (think amazon, adidas, citibank and intel, mailchimp, west elm, ebay) makes companies more approachable, casual, younger or shows a focus on tech. However, within text (general copy or headlines), brand names should still start with a capital letter (Sell on Amazon; In 2016, Mailchimp announced …).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Option 2 “Timeless”:</strong> Leading capital letters, separated by space or hyphen if more than one word is a brand that has grown up and owns its identity: Squarespace, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, The Container Store, Walmart.</p>



<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> All caps is another timeless use and often a design decision to give the type a more unified or stronger look. Think IKEA (also spelled in call caps within text), MUJI (spelled Muji within text), ZARA (in text: Zara), COSTCO (in text: Costco), THE HOME DEPOT (in text: The Home Depot), NETFLIX (in text: Netflix).</p>



<p><strong>Option 4:</strong> Leading capital letters but no spaces between compounds shows unity and strength by keeping an emphasis on the roots of both. Can be typographically less attractive and are harder to remember how to spell correctly: FedEx, McDonalds, RedBull, HomeGoods, YouTube.</p>

September 11, 2020 | https://jamesmcm.github.io/blog/2020/09/05/vopono/#en | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jamesmcm.github.io/blog/2020/09/05/vopono/#en">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post is a retrospective of my first “useful” Rust project. <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono">vopono</a> 
is a Linux program to launch applications in temporary network
namespaces (managed by vopono), in order to run specific applications
through VPN connections, without affecting the rest of your system.</p>

<p>vopono is <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono">available on Github</a> (and in the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vopono/">AUR on Arch Linux</a>) and
licensed under the GPLv3 license (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html">see reasoning here</a>).</p>

<p>We’ll consider the motivation and background to creating vopono, the
upsides and downsides of writing it in Rust (and existing issues), and
some points about starting new side projects in general. I hope this
helps new Rust programmers starting their own first projects, or for
other programmers to consider using Rust.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I’ve used VPN services for many years, previously as a customer of
PrivateInternetAccess, and now with Mullvad (since
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21584958">PrivateInternetAccess was purchased by a less scrupulous parent company</a>), as it is very
useful for working around network traffic restrictions (e.g. SSH access
restrictions or blocked websites) whilst travelling.</p>

<p>However, I often wanted to be able to quickly connect to the VPN without
disrupting other ongoing connections (i.e. video calls, etc.). In 2015,
I learnt how network namespaces could do this (on Linux), and pieced together some
bash scripts for OpenVPN <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/149293/feed-all-traffic-through-openvpn-for-a-specific-network-namespace-only">from this StackExchange post</a>.</p>

<p>I used this for a few years, but it was a bit inconvenient having to
manually launch the network namespace. Especially if you wanted to
connect to different servers in order to test geolocation for example.</p>

<p>In April 2020, Wireguard was merged in to the Linux kernel
5.6, and became much more readily available with VPN providers. This,
combined with the switch to Mullvad, inspired me to add Wireguard
support to the scripts I was using. But I thought it would be best to
also address the issues of manually managing the network namespaces and
create a comprehensive application to handle OpenVPN and Wireguard
connections for various VPN providers, and create and destroy the
network namespaces on demand.</p>

<p>This was the start of vopono, my first
useful Rust project (I suppose <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/s3rename">s3rename</a> was also useful, but a much smaller
scope).</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-rust">Benefits of Rust</h2>

<p>I chose to write vopono in Rust as I am still learning the language, and
greatly appreciate the ease of debugging with tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">clippy</a>. There are many
other benefits too:</p>

<h3 id="enums">Enums</h3>

<p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html">native enum support</a> makes reasoning and debugging much easier
when dealing with enumerated values (like the choice between the TCP and
UDP protocols for OpenVPN connections). The Rust compiler forces us to
handle every possible value helping to prevent bugs from ever being
written.</p>

<h3 id="structopt">StructOpt</h3>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/structopt">StructOpt</a> is a great crate for handling command-line options and
arguments via derived trait implementations over your structs defining
commands and subcommands. This allows you to abstract away dealing with command-line arguments directly,
and for the relevant code to be somewhat self-documenting (as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html">doc comments</a> are used to provide the user-facing help output).</p>

<p>Note that some developers prefer to use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a> directly.</p>

<h3 id="result-and-anyhow">Result and anyhow</h3>

<p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html">Result enum</a> 
and <code>?</code> operator (the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html">try operator</a>)
make it simple and ergonomic to handle operations which may fail
(which are almost all operations when dealing with disk IO and
launching processes).</p>

<p>It is also very convenient when working with fallible operations over a
collection, where we may want to return to the user a list of operations
which failed. In Rust, we can 
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/error/iter_result.html">filter and map over a collection of Results</a> 
to a collection of Errors and then return that to the user - this feels
very natural compared to other languages.</p>

<p>Combined with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow crate</a>, it is easy to provide useful error
messages to the end-user whilst also keeping the code very concise.</p>

<h3 id="serde">Serde</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">Serde crate</a> provides traits you can derive on your structs,
allowing for easy serialization and deserialization.</p>

<p>In vopono this is used to serialize and deserialize lockfiles, so that
if you launch a new application in an existing network namespace (via
vopono), the namespace will not be destroyed until <em>both</em> applications
have terminated.</p>

<h3 id="drop">Drop</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html">Drop trait</a> allows us to run a destructor when a struct is
dropped (i.e. goes out of scope). This is used in vopono to
automatically destroy the network namespaces when the application is
closed. I initially got the idea for using <code>Drop</code> this way from the
<a href="https://github.com/r-darwish/alma">ALMA source code</a>.</p>

<p>Note this causes some issues (discussed below) when we want to skip
destructors in some cases. Also if vopono is instantly terminated (i.e.
<code>kill -9</code>) these will likely not run, so vopono is written to clean up
any orphaned resources when it is executed - i.e. namespaces or
lockfiles with no running applications.</p>

<h3 id="cargo">Cargo</h3>

<p>The Cargo package manager itself is a great benefit of using Rust. For
example, when writing vopono it made it trivial to add the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/compound_duration">compound_duration</a> crate,
used only for reporting the uptime of running network namespaces.</p>

<p>The specification of the software license in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file is
also a great feature, making it easy to verify that your dependencies
have compatible licenses.</p>

<h3 id="include_str-macro">include_str macro</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html">include_str macro</a> can be used to include a file on disk as a
static string in the binary at compile time. This is used in vopono for
providers where we cannot download certain files by other means e.g.
with TigerVPN because the configuration details are behind a login with
a captcha and there is no API.</p>

<h3 id="rustls">Rustls</h3>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustls">Rustls</a> is a TLS library which can be
used in place of OpenSSL. This is used in the <code>vopono sync</code> command,
which gets provider configuration files.</p>

<p>This subcommand relies on the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reqwest">reqwest crate</a>
to make HTTPS requests, but we want to avoid depending on OpenSSL to make it easier to
build a statically linked binary that will be independent of the runtime
environment. Fortunately we only need to set the “rustls” feature flag
in the reqwest dependency.</p>

<h3 id="musl-and-static-linking">musl and static linking</h3>

<p>The <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> target can be used to (cross-)compile,
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/13/rustup.html">statically linking with musl</a> instead of dynamically linking to glibc
(the default target). This means we can deploy the resulting binary
without worrying about glibc version mismatches (if we deploy to a
platform with an earlier version of glibc).</p>

<h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>

<h3 id="small-standard-library">Small standard library</h3>

<p>If you come from scripting languages, you may find that Rust has a
smaller standard library compared to those languages. For example, there
is no recursive copy (<code>cp -r</code> equivalent) in the standard library
directly, and I had to do this using the 
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/walkdir">walkdir crate</a> and copying each item.</p>

<h3 id="compile-times">Compile times</h3>

<p>Rust has longer compile times than most other languages (except perhaps
C++) this is particularly true when using crates which include
procedural macros.</p>

<p>There a few options to <a href="https://vfoley.xyz/rust-compile-speed-tips/">reduce compile times</a>
(also <a href="https://endler.dev/2020/rust-compile-times/">see this more recent post</a>),
such as using <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sccache">sccache</a> to cache build artifacts.</p>

<h3 id="binary-size-and-feature-creep">Binary size and feature creep</h3>

<p>As more dependencies are added, the final binary size can grow
considerably. To control this, it’s recommended to use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html">feature flags</a>
in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file (and disabling default features) to
include only what you need from large dependencies.</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-udeps">cargo-udeps</a> to
detect unused dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-rust-version-and-dependencies">Minimum Rust version and dependencies</h3>

<p>The Rust features and parts of the standard library that you use will
result in an effective minimum Rust version for your project. I had <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono/issues/2">one
issue</a> result from the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/compound_duration">compound_duration crate</a> mentioned above which raised the minimum Rust
version to 1.43.</p>

<p>As far as I know there is no way to automatically determine the minimum
Rust version, although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/8kkigi/how_to_find_out_a_minimum_rust_compiler_version/">this discussion on Reddit</a>
has scripts for compiling with many minor versions until you build
successfully.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing-issues">Ongoing issues</h2>

<h3 id="dialoguer-validation-and-passing-references-to-closures">dialoguer validation and passing references to closures</h3>

<p>vopono uses the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dialoguer">dialoguer crate</a> for user input for the <code>vopono sync</code>
command. I also validate the input using the <code>validate_with()</code> method so
that the user gets feedback immediately and can correct any errors.</p>

<p>However, the <code>validate_with()</code> method <a href="https://docs.rs/dialoguer/0.6.2/dialoguer/struct.Input.html#method.validate_with">requires that the closure used has
a static lifetime</a>.
This is problematic for checking whether the user-entered Wireguard private key
matches the chosen public key, since we need to include the previously-chosen
public key in the closure - but this doesn’t have a static lifetime.</p>

<p>For now I worked around this with extra clones (<a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono/blob/master/src/providers/mozilla/wireguard.rs#L65">see devices_clone</a>)
but hopefully a better solution is possible. Perhaps the static lifetime
restriction in dialoguer could also be relaxed (since we know the
closure will terminate before we receive the input and continue).</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono/issues/19">tracked in this issue</a>. If you have any suggestions please add a comment there!</p>

<h3 id="skipping-destructors">Skipping destructors</h3>

<p>As mentioned previously, vopono uses the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html">Drop trait</a> to
automatically clean up resources when the relevant structs go out of
scope. However, sometimes we don’t want to trigger these destructors but
still have the structs go out of scope - for example, if we have
multiple vopono processes running applications in the same network
namespace, then we don’t want to destroy the network namespace until the
final application has terminated. So if other lockfiles still exist, we need
to prevent the clean-up destructors from firing.</p>

<p>For now this is done by putting the relevant structs in a Box, and then
calling <code>Box::leak()</code> (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.leak">docs here</a>).
This works but feels a bit clunky when dealing with multiple structs/fields (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono/blob/4ebf4b6bdc493c4d95bf6e237136b330723aaf27/src/netns.rs#L308">here preventing the destructors when another vopono instance is using the same namespace</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"Skipping destructors since other vopono instance using this namespace!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>openvpn</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.openvpn</span><span>.take</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>openvpn</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>openvpn</span><span>);</span>
<span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>leak</span><span>(</span><span>openvpn</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One possible alternative might be to use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/struct.ManuallyDrop.html">std::mem::ManuallyDrop</a>
, however then the <code>drop()</code> method is unsafe, so this might end up being
even less ergonomic.</p>

<p>This is tracked <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono/issues/20">in this issue</a>.</p>

<h2>Mars in 8K</h2>
<p>Along side the Japan Broadcasting Company (NHK), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Company (JAXA) has introduced that it’s planning to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-09-martian-moons-exploration-spacecraft-ultra-high.html">photograph Mars’ mysterious moons</a> with cameras that may shoot 8K ultra-high-definition photos.</p>
<p>If profitable, it might be the primary time in historical past Mars and its moons are captured in such element.</p>
<p>To drag it off, the 2 organizations are teaming as much as develop the “Tremendous Hello-Imaginative and prescient Digicam,” designed to be hooked up to JAXA’s Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) spacecraft, which is ready to launch in 2024.</p>
<h2>Phobos Anomaly</h2>
<p>The MMX mission, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/japan-sample-return-mission-mars-moon">greenlit</a> by the Japanese authorities again in February, will try to uncover the mysteries surrounding the origin tales of Mars’s two comparatively tiny moons, Deimos and Phobos. They’re extremely uncommon as they orbit the Purple Planet at extraordinarily shut distances. Deimos’ orbit takes it as shut as <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/in-depth/">3,700 miles</a> away from the Martian floor — about one p.c of the gap between the Earth and its Moon.</p>
<p>Other than the digital camera, the spacecraft will carry 11 scientific devices to the Martian system. It is going to even try to gather a floor pattern from Phobos’&nbsp;floor earlier than taking the lengthy journey house.</p>
<p>The digital camera will snap ultra-HD photos<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and broadcast them for the world to see, courtesy of JAXA. The untouched recordsdata might be domestically saved on a recording system hooked up to the MMX spacecraft and can hopefully make all of it the way in which again to Earth — if every little thing goes in keeping with plan.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.</p></blockquote><p>Over the past year, I have skimmed through 2578 social science papers, spending about 2.5 minutes on each one. This was due to my participation in <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replication Markets</a>, a part of DARPA's SCORE program, whose goal is to evaluate the reliability of social science research. 3000 studies were split up into 10 rounds of ~300 studies each. Starting in August 2019, each round consisted of one week of surveys followed by two weeks of market trading. I finished in first place in 3 out 10 survey rounds and 6 out of 10 market rounds. In total, about $200,000 in prize money will be awarded.</p><p>The studies were sourced from all social sciences disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology, management, etc.) and were published between 2009 and 2018 (in other words, most of the sample came from the post-replication crisis era).</p><p>The average replication probability in the market was 54%; while the replication results are not out yet (250 of the 3000 papers will be replicated), previous experiments have shown that prediction markets work well.<span><a href="#fn19282306691" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306691">1</sup></a></span></p><p>This is what the distribution of my own predictions looks like:<span><a href="#fn19282306692" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306692">2</sup></a></span></p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_mypredsdist-67f351a8a634ca87ace22fd62155e7c5.png"></p><p>My average forecast was in line with the market. A quarter of the claims were above 76%. And a quarter of them were below 33%: we're talking hundreds upon hundreds of terrible papers, and this is just a tiny sample of the annual academic production.</p><p>Criticizing bad science from an abstract, 10000-foot view is pleasant: you hear about some stuff that doesn't replicate, some methodologies that seem a bit silly. "They should improve their methods", "p-hacking is bad", "we must change the incentives", you declare Zeuslike from your throne in the clouds, and then go on with your day.</p><p>But actually diving into the sea of trash that is social science gives you a more tangible perspective, a more visceral revulsion, and perhaps even a sense of Lovecraftian awe at the sheer magnitude of it all: a vast landfill—a great agglomeration of garbage extending as far as the eye can see, effluvious waves crashing and throwing up a foul foam of p=0.049 papers. As you walk up to the diving platform, the deformed attendant hands you a pair of flippers. Noticing your reticence, he gives a subtle nod as if to say: "come on then, jump in".</p><h2 id="They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing"><a href="#They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing" title="They Know What They're Doing"></a>They Know What They're Doing</h2><p>Prediction markets work well because predicting replication is easy.<span><a href="#fn19282306693" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306693">3</sup></a></span> There's no need for a deep dive into the statistical methodology or a rigorous examination of the data, no need to scrutinize esoteric theories for subtle errors—these papers have obvious, surface-level problems.</p><p>There's a popular belief that weak studies are the result of unconscious biases leading researchers down a "garden of forking paths". Given enough "researcher degrees of freedom" even the most punctilious investigator can be misled.</p><p>I find this belief impossible to accept. The brain is a credulous piece of meat<span><a href="#fn19282306694" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306694">4</sup></a></span> but there are limits to self-delusion. Most of them have to know. It's understandable to be led down the garden of forking paths while producing the research, but when the paper is done and you give it a final read-over you will surely notice that all you have is a n=23, p=0.049 three-way interaction effect (one of dozens you tested, and with no multiple testing adjustments of course). At that point it takes more than a <em>subtle unconscious bias</em> to believe you have found something real. And even if the authors really are misled by the forking paths, what are the editors and reviewers doing? Are we supposed to believe they are all gullible rubes?</p><p>People within the academy don't want to rock the boat. They still have to attend the conferences, secure the grants, publish in the journals, show up at the faculty meetings: all these things depend on their peers. When criticising bad research it's easier for everyone to blame the forking paths rather than the person walking them. No need for uncomfortable unpleasantries. The fraudster can admit, without much of a hit to their reputation, that indeed they were <em>misled</em> by that <em>dastardly garden</em>, really through no fault of their own whatsoever, at which point their colleagues on twitter will applaud and say "ah, good on you, you handled this tough situation with such exquisite virtue, this is how progress happens! hip, hip, hurrah!" What a ridiculous charade.</p><p>Even when they do accuse someone of wrongdoing they use terms like "Questionable Research Practices" (QRP). How about Questionable Euphemism Practices?</p><ul><li>When they measure a dozen things and only pick their outcome variable at the end, that's not the garden of forking paths but the greenhouse of fraud.</li><li>When they do a correlational analysis but give "policy implications" as if they were doing a causal one, they're not walking around the garden, they're doing the landscaping of forking paths.</li><li>When they take a continuous variable and arbitrarily bin it to do subgroup analysis or when they add an <em>ad hoc</em> quadratic term to their regression, they're...fertilizing the garden of forking paths? (Look, there's only so many horticultural metaphors, ok?)</li></ul><p>The bottom line is this: if a random schmuck with zero domain expertise like me can predict what will replicate, <em>then so can scientists who have spent half their lives studying this stuff</em>. But they sure don't act like it.</p><h2 id="or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t"><a href="#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t" title="...or Maybe They Don't?"></a>...or Maybe They Don't?</h2><blockquote><p>The horror!

(2020)</a>:</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_citations-7d4f72c6e9582a5ba8775da70eda80e1.png"></p><p>Yes, you're reading that right: studies that replicate are cited at the same rate as studies that do not. Publishing your own weak papers is one thing, but citing other people's weak papers? This seemed implausible, so I decided to do my own analysis with a sample of 250 articles from the Replication Markets project. The correlation between citations per year and (market-estimated) probability of replication was -0.05!</p><p>You might hypothesize that the citations of non-replicating papers are negative, but negative citations are extremely rare.<span><a href="#fn19282306695" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306695">5</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> puts the rate at 2.4%.

Either:</p><ol><li>Malice: they know which results are likely false but cite them anyway.</li><li>or, Stupidity: they can't tell which papers will replicate even though it's quite easy.</li></ol><p>Accepting the first option would require a level of cynicism that even I struggle to muster. But the alternative doesn't seem much better: <em>how can they not know?</em> I, an idiot with no relevant credentials or knowledge, can fairly accurately determine good research from bad, but all the tenured experts can not? How can they not tell <em>which papers are retracted</em>?</p><p>I think the most plausible explanation is that scientists don't read the papers they cite, which I suppose involves both malice <em>and</em> stupidity.<span><a href="#fn19282306697" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306697">7</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Scanners#citogenesis-how-often-do-researchers-not-read-the-papers-they-cite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwern has an write-up on this question</a> citing some ingenious analyses based on the proliferation of misprints: "Simkin &amp; Roychowdhury venture a guess that as many as 80% of authors citing a paper have not actually read the original". Once a paper is out there nobody bothers to check it, even though they know there's a 50-50 chance it's false!</p><p>Whatever the explanation might be, the fact is that the academic system does not allocate citations to true claims.<span><a href="#fn19282306698" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306698">8</sup></a></span> This is bad not only for the direct effect of basing further research on false results, but also because it distorts the incentives scientists face. If nobody cited weak studies, we wouldn't have so many of them. Rewarding impact without regard for the truth inevitably leads to disaster.</p><h2 id="There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards"><a href="#There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards" title="There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards"></a>There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards</h2><p>Naïvely you might expect that the top-ranking journals would be full of studies that are highly likely to replicate, and the low-ranking journals would be full of p&lt;0.1 studies based on five undergraduates. Not so! Like citations, journal status and quality are not very well correlated: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no association between statistical power and impact factor</a>, and journals with higher impact factor <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/071530v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have more papers with erroneous p-values</a>.</p><p>This pattern is repeated in the Replication Markets data. As you can see in the chart below, there's no relationship between h-index (a measure of impact) and average expected replication rates. There's also no relationship between h-index and expected replication <em>within</em> fields.</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_journalhindex-34ca20d3877248fe6b7313c3e2d39fae.png"></p><p>Even the <em>crème de la crème</em> of economics journals barely manage a ⅔ expected replication rate. 1 in 5 articles in QJE scores below 50%, and this is a journal that accepts just 1 out of every 30 submissions. Perhaps this (partially) explains why scientists are undiscerning: journal reputation acts as a cloak for bad research. It would be fun to test this idea empirically.</p><p>Here you can see the distribution of replication estimates for every journal in the RM sample:</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_journals-cdc1139ad4faf1819b8b42db914dbe81.png"></p><p>As far as I can tell, for most journals the question of whether the results in a paper are true is a matter of secondary importance. If we model journals as wanting to maximize "impact", then this is hardly surprising: as we saw above, citation counts are unrelated to truth. If scientists were more careful about what they cited, then journals would in turn be more careful about what they publish.</p><h2 id="Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better"><a href="#Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better" title="Things Are Not Getting Better"></a>Things Are Not Getting Better</h2><p>Before we got to see any of the actual Replication Markets studies, we voted on the expected replication rates by year. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gordon et al.

                <center><em><p>The most ambitious crossover event in automatic differentiation history</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Friday, September 11, 2020 · 4 min read</h4>
<blockquote>
<p> Summary of this post: It turns out that by carefully mixing forward-mode and
 reverse-mode automatic differentiation, you can greatly simplify certain
 hyperparameter optimization algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fun recursive idea: just like how we optimize the parameters of
machine learning models by gradient descent, we can also their
<em>hyperparameters</em> by gradient descent. This is by no means a new idea; you can
find 20-year-old papers that discuss (for example) optimizing gradient descent
step sizes by gradient descent itself.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two ways to do this. The “short-term” way is to take a
<em>single</em>  step of gradient descent, and then based on how that goes, adjust the
hyperparameters. That’s the premise of the 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04782">Online Learning Rate
Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent</a>: it
turns out that you can do this in an extremely lightweight way. You would hope
that over time the hyperparameters converge to something optimal alongside the
parameters (and indeed that is the case, though you have to be careful).</p>
<p>The “long-term” way is to train <em>several</em> steps and <em>then</em> backpropagate
through the <em>entire training</em> to adjust the hyperparameters. The hope is that
this provides a stronger “signal” to the hyperparameter-gradient, which is
better for convergence. But, this comes at the (tremendous) expense of having
to store a copy of the entire computation graph for several steps of training,
and then backpropagate through it. If your model has 1GB of parameters, you
need to store ~1GB worth of numbers for <em>each step</em>. You can imagine that adds
up over the course of many epochs, and so the algorithm is severely limited by
how much RAM you have.</p>
<p>The 2015 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03492">Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization through Reversible
Learning</a> makes this work by throwing away
the intermediate steps of the computation graph and then JIT-re-computing it
“in reverse” during backpropagation. It’s a clever technique, but kind of hairy
and hard to implement (you have to be super careful about numerical precision).</p>
<p>Here’s a graph that visualizes these two techniques (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13371">from this
paper</a>). You’re looking at several parallel
loss curves (($\log(f)$) is the loss plotted on a log scale), pointing towards
you, arranged in order of the “step size” hyperparameter
(that’s ($\log(\alpha)$)). The orange curve represents a “short-term”
hyperparameter optimization, which is allowed to move along the “step size”
axis at each step. The “long-term” hyperparameter optimization instead
optimizes directly on the thick black dashed “U” — that is, after <em>several</em>
steps of training. You can see how the latter is smoother, but also much harder
to compute.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/fig-metasurface.png" alt="The preceding paragraph explains this
figure."></p>
<p>To summarize: the short-term way is cheap but noisy. The long-term way is
expensive but less noisy. Can we get the best of both worlds?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, let’s think more carefully about the source of the expense. The problem
is that we need to store (or be able to reconstruct) the full computation graph
in order to do backpropagation. Okay, but do we really <em>need</em> to do
backpropagation? The only reason we backpropagate is that it’s more efficient
in the case when you want derivatives with respect to <em>many</em> different
variables. If you have millions of model parameters, backpropagation is
millions of times faster than the much simpler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers">forward-mode (“dual numbers”)
automatic
differentiation</a>.</p>
<p>But we <em>don’t</em> have millions of <em>hyperparameters!</em> Step size, for example, is
just a single number. The Adam optimizer only has a total of 4 hyperparameters.
With this in mind, backpropagation isn’t even the right choice — we <em>should</em>
be using dual numbers for the hyperparameter optimization. On the other hand,
we should still be using backpropagation for the “inner loop” that optimizes
the (non-hyper-) parameters. That is, we want to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>initialize hyperparameters
# loop to optimize hyperparameters
while True:
  initialize parameters
  # loop to optimize parameters
  for i in range(100):
    run model on data to get loss
    # using reverse-mode!
    compute d(loss) / d(parameters)
    update parameters using hyperparameters
  # using forward-mode
  compute d(loss) / d(hyperparameters)
  update hyperparameters
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update: I discovered that this was suggested in the 2017 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01785">Forward and
Reverse Gradient-Based Hyperparameter
Optimization</a>. But keep reading — while
the paper’s
<a href="https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO/blob/master/far_ho/hyper_gradients.py#L375">implementation</a>
needs a lot of math to be worked out manually, I’m going to show you how to
implement this in a way that makes all the math in the paper fall out “for
free”…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal raises a logistical question: how do we reconcile these two
automatic differentiation algorithms in the same program? <strong>The “trick” is to
“thread” dual numbers through a backpropagation implementation.</strong> In other
words, implement backpropagation as usual, but rather than <code>float</code> type
numbers, exclusively use <code>dual_number</code> type numbers (even when doing derivative
calculations). Initialize the system such that the dual numbers track
derivatives with respect to the hyperparameters you care about. Then, your
final loss value’s attached ($\epsilon$)-value <em>immediately</em> gives you
<code>d(loss)/d(hyperparameters)</code>. No backpropagation needed — and so, it’s safe
to “forget” the computation graph.</p>
<p>That’s it! That’s all I wanted to share in this blog post! :)</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not obvious how to implement this in PyTorch, since you can’t
naïvely do <code>tensor(dtype=dual_number)</code>. Rather than hack in a custom numeric
data type that implemented dual numbers, I wrote my own tiny implementations of
forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. It’s just a couple dozen
(very-recognizable-to-automatic-differentiation-enthusiasts) lines of code. I
was careful to make each implementation generic in the kind of “number” it
accepts. That allowed me to run the reverse-mode algorithms using the
forward-mode data types.</p>
<p>Running it on a simple quadratic optimization problem, we can see that updating
the hyperparameter ($\alpha$) yields better-looking loss curves — in this
GIF, we’re discovering that we should increase the step size. Yay!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/loss.gif" alt="GIF of loss curve becoming better over
time"></p>
<p>I think this is a very neat trick, which surely has other cool applications
(for example, differentiating through long-running physics simulations!). If
you’re curious, check out this <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/hybrid-hyperoptimization.ipynb">IPython
notebook</a> for
the full source code. Feel free to adapt it to your ideas. Then, tell me what
you’ve built!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>If you have the luxury of starting a new team, or evolving a team overtime, you might want to try collaborating with the team on a working agreement. I call these Team Agreements, or Team Charters. </p>

<p>I've used these in many teams over the years and it can make a huge difference, especially when things get hard. I will outline some things I like to add and the guidelines I set up during the inception, but each team is going to be different and the more you learn about each other, the better the conversation is going to be. Not everything in this post will work for you. That's OK.</p>

<h2>Set the tone</h2>
<p>Sometimes teammates don't want to open up with each other about things that bother them. This is especially true if it’s a new team with a mix of new and old employees to the company. </p>

<p>Set the tone by explaining what the agreement is and what it is not. As a team, we want to work better without stepping on each other. We want to be productive and efficient and we want to give and receive feedback in a manner that doesn’t feel like a pile on.</p>

<p>This isn't meant to be a checklist, a document to consult to get someone in trouble or a rule of law to consult in a high court of the agile tribunal. We are all human with our own feelings, experiences and bad days. Lets make it easy and open to be able to talk to each other about what kind of environment we want to work in.</p>

<p>Its good to add this to the meeting agenda and lead with at the top of the meeting. I’ve learned how it’s refreshing to see this type of meeting especially for those who have never worked in a setting where their voice matters, or the voices of their teammates. </p>

<p>Pause a moment and ask for questions. Let people feel it out, poke at the goal and make sure everyone is on the same page for the task at hand.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>A theme in a lot of my blog posts, take notes. Take a lot of notes. It's alright to distill down the working agreement after the meeting. But take a bunch of notes and add names to them as much as you can. You might find it useful to revisit what someone has said. </p>

<p>I usually keep a shared doc open on the screen for the whole team to see what I’m writing down and to ask if I captured the essence of what they are talking through. </p>

<p>Once you are done with the meeting, its also important to share this document out with the team and allow everyone to read and comment on the notes. Maybe someone had a specific example they wanted to add, or a clarification to an item logged during the meeting they thought of later.</p>

<h2>Team Rules</h2>
<p>I break down the session into two primary sections. The first is about the team rules. This is how individuals want to be treated, things they bother them and actions they hate and love to see working in a team. This might be difficult for some, especially if some of you’re team hasn't worked in a larger team before. </p>

<p>I usually keep a couple things in my pocket for if this part starts a bit rough. My number one thing <code>Assume Good Intent</code> in all interactions, always. It’s very rare to have someone work with you that is intentionally trying to sabotage your progress.</p>

<p>These team rules can literally be anything and I hope you write them all down, too. You might gain some insights into people you didn’t already know.</p>

<p>I've had teams making rules about bringing smelly food into the enclosed team rooms, being onetime to all meetings (this will come up in the next section), how we close out standup every morning and how to address difficult feedback. </p>

<p>This is going to be very unique to your team at the time you write these down. Its also going to evolve and you should hold sync ups about these agreements when major changes happen to your team. </p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>The next section I focus on is exceptions. This is for the individuals on the team to ensure a happy team for the individual. :confused-face:</p>

<p>Here again I have a few items in my pocket to throw out if things are slow to start. Being on time to meetings is something I try very hard to do. I want us to start on time, and end on time. I want everyone to have their voice heard and to not rush to end the meeting because we’re over time. So I task everyone to try to be on time to all meetings, not for them, but for the team. </p>

<p>I again address the respecting each other and the pillar of assuming good intent. This is super important for me and for the team. It also shines outward in the interactions with other teams. Everyone has a different way of working and that’s great. As long as we know and respect each others boundaries.</p>

<p>Here we also try to define the meetings, the time frames and the expectations of work as a team we agree to. In some cases that is swarming on the testable column to get tickets out the door, other times it might be how and when to call out a risk, how to bring feedback to a process and the process of changing our processes.</p>

<p>I have found this section to be driven a little closer by the manager of the team. Setting a clear guard rail for the team to self regulate and to be on time for each other. </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Once you have all this great information and its distilled down into a clear and readable list of rules and items we all agree on, its time to document this in a highly visible area. Most companies have a wiki or intranet where you can have your own team pages. This is the perfect place to put it.</p>

<p>It's public for your team to see, to watch and monitor for edits. Other teams can see it and know how to best interact with you and your team. It also isn’t chiseled into stone and can be revised along the way. </p>

<p>When you document the agreement and put it up in a public space, make sure you pass that link to every nook and cranny of the team. We have our team wiki as a fast link on our Jira sidebar, in the team slack channel and I routinely post it for the team to view. Get the message out, this is how our team is working and how we treat each other. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I highly recommend setting up a team working agreement no matter the situation you find yourself in. This can be the difference between a team that is good and a team that is great. A team that knows where each others boundaries are and a team that is transparent and open to talk about the things that work well and not so well.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Early in my career, after a short initial interview at a consulting firm in Toronto, I was invited to a technical interview on the same day. Two of the senior developers from the team I would join would conduct the interview.</p><p>The interview started pleasantly with them describing the project they have been working on: a portal for university professors to communicate with their students. It was being built with ASP.NET MVC, a framework I had been working with for several years. I expressed that I was comfortable with the framework and I would be excited to work on the project. Then the technical examination began and on its conclusion I left the interview feeling humiliated.</p><p>Many years later, when I was preparing to take an interview, I looked back on this experience to realize that the line of questioning and approach had been an ego trip for those developers. I promised myself to <em>never</em> make any of my candidates feel the way I did.</p><p>What did those developers do wrong? Leaving aside their attitude towards me, their questions had no relevance to the role or the project. I did not know what a red-black tree was at the time but I definitely knew how to use ASP.NET MVC which they did not inquire about.</p><p>My golden rule for technical interviews is that, "Every step, conversation and question <em>must</em> be pertinent to the day-to-day of the role." While this may be obvious, I am sure that many hiring managers are still expecting candidates to arrive at technical interviews with Computer Science books memorized. This form of technical interviews should be made obsolete.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bigger button = more clicks on the CTA <a href="https://t.co/Ter7xJdNKM">pic.twitter.com/Ter7xJdNKM</a></p>— Vincent Déniel (@vincentdnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentdnl/status/1291041278264713220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>With my golden rule as guide, I conduct a much simpler interview process. Prior to an interview, my team and I review samples of code that the candidate shared with us (or had written on Github) to understand the quality of their code. And during the interview, I dive into three areas of discussions with the candidates: product building, process adherence and team work.</p><h3 id="product-building">Product Building</h3><p>I try to understand the candidate's interest and experience of building products by,</p><ol><li>Going through their past experience and asking about what technologies and products they built and how. I ask about previous products they have shipped from concept to market.</li><li>To understand their thought process for deriving solutions, I draw an UI and ask them to outline and explain what approaches, structures and technologies they would use to build it out.</li><li>I ask about how they keep up with technologies and how they improve their skills to gauge their passion for the work.</li></ol><h3 id="process-adherence">Process Adherence</h3><p>To better understand how the candidate does their work,</p><ol><li>I go over their experiences and ask about how they managed their product-building and what tools and processes they used.</li><li>I explain the process of working on our team and ask how they would change it and where they see inefficiencies to discuss their thinking.</li><li>Often, I will give them a scenario where the processes are failing the team to find what they would do to tackle inefficiencies and if they would be willing to speak up.</li></ol><h3 id="team-work">Team Work</h3><p>I also try to understand how a candidate works in a team,</p><ol><li>While going through their past experiences, I ask about how they collaborated and communicated with their teams.</li><li>I present a scenario where their knowledge in an area may be lacking and evaluate if and how they would leverage and collaborate with their team.</li><li>Another scenario I ask about is where they disagree with their team-members to evaluate how they manage conflict and focus on delivering results for the team.</li></ol><p>I do this within one interview to be mindful of the candidate's time and mine. I want to hire candidates for their will to learn, grow and challenge the status quo.</p><p>The technology landscape is such that anyone can acquire a set of baseline programming skills. What is needed then, is a willingness to challenge ourselves and stay open-minded because every developer will have to learn on the job almost all of the time. Given this, the technical interview is arcane, academic and as good as dead.</p><hr><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><ol><li><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/helpful-com/https-medium-com-fnthawar-helpful-technical-interviews-are-garbage-dc5d9aee5acd">Technical interviews are garbage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the post we will investigate the main concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data-oriented
Design</a> using Rust.</p>

<p>The source code for this example is <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/data-oriented-example">available on Github</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="what-is-data-oriented-design">What is data-oriented design?</h2>

<p>Data-oriented design is an approach to optimising programs by carefully
considering the memory layout of data structures, and their implications
for auto-vectorisation and use of the CPU cache. I highly recommend
watching Mike Acton’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">“Data-Oriented Design and C++”</a> talk
if you haven’t seen it already.</p>

<p>In this post we will cover 4 cases, using <a href="https://docs.rs/criterion/0.3.3/criterion/">criterion</a> for
benchmarking. The cases are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Struct of arrays vs. array of structs</li>
  <li>The cost of branching inside a hot loop</li>
  <li>Linked List vs. Vector iteration</li>
  <li>The cost of dynamic dispatch vs. monomorphisation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="struct-of-arrays-vs-array-of-structs">Struct of Arrays vs. Array of Structs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA">Struct of Arrays vs. Array of Structs</a> 
refers to two contrasting ways of organising entity data to be operated
over.</p>

<p>For example, imagine we are writing a video game and we would like to
have a Player struct with the following fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Player</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>health</span><span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>location</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>velocity</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>acceleration</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then at each frame, we want to update the locations and velocities of all
Players. We could write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>run_oop</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>player</span> <span>in</span> <span>players</span><span>.iter_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>player</span><span>.location</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.location</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.location</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>);</span>
        <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.acceleration</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.acceleration</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would be the usual object-oriented approach to this problem. The
issue here is that in memory the structs are stored as follows (assuming
no field re-ordering i.e. <code>#[repr(C)]</code>), on a 64-bit architecture each field will be 64
bits (8 bytes, so each Player is 64 bytes):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-- Vec&lt;Player&gt;
name  (pointer to heap)  -- Player 1
health    
location0  (tuple split for clarity) 
location1
velocity0
velocity1
acceleration0
acceleration1
name  (pointer to heap)  -- Player 2
location0    
location1
velocity0
velocity1
acceleration0
acceleration1
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the parts we want to operate on (locations, velocities and
accelerations) are not stored contiguously across different Players.
This prevents us from using vector operations to operate on multiple
players at once (since they cannot be loaded in the same CPU cache
line, usually ~64 bytes).</p>

<p>In contrast, the data-oriented approach is to design around this
limitation and optimise for auto-vectorisation. Instead of using a
struct per Player, we now use one struct for all Players and each Player
has their values stored at their index in the separate attribute Vectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>DOPlayers</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>names</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>health</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>locations</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>velocities</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>acceleration</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can do the same calculation as in the OOP case as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>run_dop</span><span>(</span><span>world</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>DOPlayers</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>vel</span><span>,</span> <span>acc</span><span>))</span> <span>in</span> <span>world</span>
        <span>.locations</span>
        <span>.iter_mut</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>world</span><span>.velocities</span><span>.iter_mut</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>world</span><span>.acceleration</span><span>.iter</span><span>()))</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>pos</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
        <span>*</span><span>vel</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>acc</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>acc</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case the memory layout is as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>-- DOPlayers
name1    -- names
name2
...
health1    -- health
health2
...
location1    -- locations
location2
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The relevant fields are now stored contiguously. Given that each
location tuple will be 16 bytes, we could now feasibly load 4 location
tuples on the same cache line to operate on them simultaneously with
SIMD instructions.</p>

<h3 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h3>

<p>Here are the results of the criterion benchmark for the above code (the
full code and benchmark code is available <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/data-oriented-example">in the Github repo</a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://jamesmcm.github.io/images/soa.svg" alt="AoS vs. SoA benchmark" title="AoS vs. SoA benchmark"></p>

<p>Overall, we see that the data-oriented approach finishes in half the
time. This would seem to be due to the data-oriented case operating on
two Players at a time - we can confirm this by reviewing the compiled
assembly.</p>

<p>Reviewing the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/d8bjMb">output on Godbolt</a> we see the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Relevant OOP loop
.LBB0_2:
        movupd  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx + 32]
        movupd  xmm1, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx + 48]
        movupd  xmm2, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx + 64]
        addpd   xmm0, xmm1
        movupd  xmmword ptr [rax + rdx + 32], xmm0
        addpd   xmm2, xmm1
        movupd  xmmword ptr [rax + rdx + 48], xmm2
        add     rdx, 80
        cmp     rcx, rdx
        jne     .LBB0_2

// ...
// Relevant DOP loop
.LBB1_7:
        movupd  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rcx + rdx - 16]
        movupd  xmm1, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx - 16]
        addpd   xmm1, xmm0
        movupd  xmmword ptr [rcx + rdx - 16], xmm1
        movupd  xmm0, xmmword ptr [r9 + rdx - 16]
        movupd  xmm1, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx - 16]
        addpd   xmm1, xmm0
        movupd  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx]
        movupd  xmmword ptr [rax + rdx - 16], xmm1
        add     rdi, 2
        movupd  xmm1, xmmword ptr [rcx + rdx]
        addpd   xmm1, xmm0
        movupd  xmmword ptr [rcx + rdx], xmm1
        movupd  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax + rdx]
        movupd  xmm1, xmmword ptr [r9 + rdx]
        addpd   xmm1, xmm0
        movupd  xmmword ptr [rax + rdx], xmm1
        add     rdx, 32
        cmp     rsi, rdi
        jne     .LBB1_7
        test    r8, r8
        je      .LBB1_5
</code></pre>

<p>We can see in the data-oriented case, the loop is unrolled to operate on
two elements at once - resulting in the 50% speed up overall!</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: As noted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hxqwom/an_introduction_to_data_oriented_design_with_rust/fz8lxcq/">/u/five9a2 on Reddit</a>
the above output is specifically for the default target, which is
misleading since <code>cargo bench</code> uses the native target by default (i.e.
all possible features on your CPU), so our benchmarks are not using the
above assembly code.</p>

<p>By setting the compiler flag to <code>-C target-cpu=skylake-avx512</code> to enable 
Skylake features, we get the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/PEPdvn">following output</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// OOP loop
.LBB0_2:
        vmovupd ymm0, ymmword ptr [rax + rdx + 32]
        vaddpd  ymm0, ymm0, ymmword ptr [rax + rdx + 48]
        vmovupd ymmword ptr [rax + rdx + 32], ymm0
        add     rdx, 80
        cmp     rcx, rdx
        jne     .LBB0_2

...
// DOP loop
.LBB1_19:
        vmovupd zmm0, zmmword ptr [rsi + 4*rax - 64]
        vaddpd  zmm0, zmm0, zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax - 64]
        vmovupd zmmword ptr [rsi + 4*rax - 64], zmm0
        vmovupd zmm0, zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax - 64]
        vaddpd  zmm0, zmm0, zmmword ptr [r10 + 4*rax - 64]
        vmovupd zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax - 64], zmm0
        vmovupd zmm0, zmmword ptr [rsi + 4*rax]
        vaddpd  zmm0, zmm0, zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax]
        vmovupd zmmword ptr [rsi + 4*rax], zmm0
        vmovupd zmm0, zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax]
        vaddpd  zmm0, zmm0, zmmword ptr [r10 + 4*rax]
        vmovupd zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax], zmm0
        add     r11, 8
        add     rax, 32
        add     rdi, 2
        jne     .LBB1_19
        test    r9, r9
        je      .LBB1_22
</code></pre>

<p>Here we see the OOP loop making use of the 256-bit ymm registers for the
position tuple and velocity tuple, and another for the velocity tuple
and acceleration tuple. This is possible because they are adjacent in
memory (due to the ordering of the fields). In the DOP loop,
the 512-bit zmm register is used.</p>

<p>It seems the performance differences comes from the bandwidth between
cache levels, since the performance is identical for the small examples.
This can be demonstrated further by removing the extra fields from the
struct - in this case we see only a 25% performance difference (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Th91Wa">godbolt
link</a>), and this
corresponds to Player struct now being 384 bits (and so 1/4 of the
512-bit read/write is unused).</p>

<p>This emphasises how important it is to consider your deployment target,
and if deploying performance-sensitive code, to consider setting the
target-cpu explicitly to benefit from all of its features.</p>

<p>It also demonstrates how the ordering of fields can be important to
performance. By default Rust will re-order fields automatically, but you can set
<code>#[repr(C)]</code> to disable this (necessary for C interoperability for
example).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>This example demonstrates the importance of considering memory layout
when aiming for performant code and auto-vectorisation.</p>

<p>Note that the same logic can also apply when working with arrays of
structs - making your struct smaller will allow you to load more
elements on the same cache line and possibly lead to autovectorisation.
<a href="https://github.com/Rene-007/flake_growth/blob/master/src/helpers.rs">Here is an example</a> of
a crate (which was shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hmqjvs/growing_gold_with_rust/">Rust subreddit</a>) that achieved a 40% performance
improvement by doing just that.</p>

<p>This particular re-organisation has a direct analogue in database design. A
major difference between databases aimed at transactional (OLTP)
workloads and analytical (OLAP) workloads is that the latter tend to use
columnar-based storage. Just like the case above, this means that
operations on one column can take advantage of the contiguous storage
and use vector operations, which tends to be the main access pattern for
analytical workloads (e.g. calculate the average purchase size across all rows,
rather than updating and retrieving entire, specific rows).</p>

<p>In the case of analytical databases this is actually a double win, since it also
applies to the serialisation of the data to disk, where compression can
now be applied along the column (where the data is guaranteed to be of the
same type) leading to much better compression ratios.</p>

<p>If you are working on a problem that might benefit from the struct of
arrays approach, and want to run a quick benchmark, you might be
interested in the <a href="https://github.com/lumol-org/soa-derive">soa-derive</a>
crate that will allow you to derive the struct of arrays from your
struct.</p>

<h2 id="branching-in-a-hot-loop">Branching in a hot loop</h2>

<p>Another optimisation tactic is to avoid branching in any “hot” parts of
the code (i.e. any part that will be executed many, many times).</p>

<p>Branching can arise in subtle ways, often by trying to use one struct for many
different cases. For example, we might define some general Node type …</p></div></div>

	<p>I have been using Evernote for quite some years now as my go-to application for 
notes, bookmarks, sketches, etc. Indeed, it is not a bad choice: clients for all platforms
you can imagine, synchronization between devices, good enough editor with formatting,
typical hierarchical notes organization into notebooks and sub-notebooks, tags, sharing
options, etc. I even had a paid version in order to have synchronization on more than two
devices. And still, I have never felt that I have been using all its potential.</p>

</div>

<figcaption>Evernote for macOS</figcaption>

<p>Eventually, I realized that my notes were lying “dead“ there. Like a pile of useless crap.
Basically, once something got into Evernote, I just forgot about it. And, probably, never
open this note again, except for some edge cases. These notes were not helping me.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> – the app on hype now. It had invitation system,
so I could only check out the <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/k5RxbGuJN">demo page</a>.
But it was not the tool itself that made me switch from Evernote. By watching tutorials,
and reading articles about Roam I grasped the idea of a second brain, a personal
knowledge base. This is where it all clicked – my Evernote notes are junk, because they
are not connected to each other. Yes, I have a notebook “Programming“, but notes inside this 
notebook are just separate pieces with no relation to each other whatsoever. These 
relations exist only in my head. And my head has only so much free space to hold all 
this stuff.</p>

	</figure>
</div>

<figcaption>Roam Research</figcaption>

<p>The essential part that is missing in Evernote in comparison to, let’s say the same Roam
Research, is linking of the notes. One can argue, that Evernote has notes links. But 
functionality- and comfort-wise they are a joke. Imagine, you are writing a note about 
new sorting algorithm, and now you want to link some phrase to the big-O notation note. 
You have to: 
	1. Find big-O note (potentially in another notebook).
	2. Then right click and find an option to copy the note link.
	3. Then go back to the place where you want to place the link and
	4. Finally, paste it.
I almost died from boredom by just explaining this procedure. By the time you finish it,
you have already lost any thought train you had.</p>

<p>Just to have a link inside a note to another note is not enough, though. Another powerful
concept is back linking. Imagine, you are looking at a note, and you can immediately see 
if any other note refers to it. You might have linked it from another place without putting
too much thought, but in the end you created a new association that can create a new idea.
Pretty cool. Some apps go further and even provide so called “non-referenced“ links, i.e.
they show other notes that reference just the title of the current note as a text.</p>

<p>I was hooked and decided to switch. But first, I needed to find <strong>the perfect</strong> application,
of course. Roam Research is too expensive. I mean, I am glad to spend $15/month for an 
app, if I know that this is a game changer. But not from the day one. So I started my
research. Oh boy, just look at <strong><a href="https://www.notion.so/db13644f08144495ad9877f217a161a1?v=ff6777802811416ba08dc114e0b11837">this huge list</a></strong> of 85 note-taking applications! I think I have 
looked almost through all of them, and fooled around with at least 15 or so.</p>

<p>The most worthy of mention are <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, and
my favorite so far – <strong><a href="https://www.remnote.io/">RemNote</a></strong>.</p>

<p>RemNote is great. It is free. It is packed with features. It is ugly. Well, to be 
fair it was ugly until the recent upgrade a few days ago. Now it is a bit better. But I
like the spirit. Started to use it on a daily basis. Cancelled my Evernote subscription. 
It is a long way for RemNote to become great, though. What they currently lack is media
promotion. This is a great application nobody is talking about! Everybody talks 
only about Roam Research.</p>

	</figure>
</div>

<figcaption>RemNote tutorial page</figcaption>

<p>So did I just find a perfect tool for me? I am not sure, to be honest. RemNote has a bunch 
of downsides. For example, lack of a desktop application that is huge minus for me, since
I hate doing serious work in a browser window. I also have some concerns about the future
of the app: there is no business behind, and I cannot tell for sure how serious the authors
are about continuing working on it. I definitely don’t want to lose all my notes in two years or so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget, that there are other players on the market. There are so many options!
Having so much variety might seem like a good thing in the first place, but it leads to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a>. I really just want
to have the work done, to have my brain organized and get the most out of my notes. I 
don’t want to spend endless hours on choosing <strong>the</strong> right tool.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just switch to <a href="https://www.williamhern.com/living-in-a-single-text-file.html">one</a>
<a href="https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/">text file</a> or <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>?</p>

            <p>
    Posted on 2016-03-07
    
        <span>golang, typesetting, unix</span>
    
</p>

<p>A while ago, I bought the book “<a href="http://gopl.io/">The Go Programming Language</a>” written by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan. I have always been a fan of Brian Kernighan’s writings. I should admit that I bought the book mainly for his great examples and writings than for the Go language itself, but since then have got interested in the Go Language, after starting to read the book.</p>
<p>Perhaps every programmer knows Brian Kernighan as the “K” in the famous K&amp;R book. He has also written a bunch of other great books, most of them are on my shelf, including some which are out of print. My other favourites are “Software tools” book and the “AWK programming language” book. Brian is also the “K” in “AWK” language.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the book does not disappoint at all. The way the language features are described and the “story” developed is something every programming language book author could try to emulate. One of the features of Prof.&nbsp;Kernighan’s books is that the first chapter is a tour of the language features and gives a good taste of the syntax of the language, leaving the readers with enough knowledge to mess around with the language and start writing complete programs.</p>
<p>The thing that stood out the most in my eyes was the outstanding quality of the type setting. Everything seemed just right.</p>
<p>Some (or most?) readers take typesetting of the programming books very seriously. There is this joke of Donald Knuth taking a break from the TAOCP book project to “invent” the TeX typesetting system.</p>
<p>One of the early goofups in typesetting is also incidentally in the K&amp;R Book, written by Brian Kernighan, brought to my attention by my friend and colleague, <a href="http://olvemaudal.com/">Olve Maudal</a>. A number of readers of the K&amp;R C 2nd edition book believed that pointers and arrays are the same, due to the non-optimal pagination.</p>

</figure>
<p>Okay, that aside, I emailed Prof.&nbsp;Kernighan about the tools he used to type set the book. There is a brief mention about it in the copyright page. But that didn’t satisfy me much. Here is what I wrote, on 28th Feb, 2016:</p>
<pre><code> Dear Prof. Kernighan,
 
 The Go programming language book is so beautifully typeset. To my eyes,
 it is more beautiful than those LaTeX based ones. But that's just my
 perception..
 
 Could you please say a few things about how your writing flow was and
 how you type set the book? I see the tools used in the copyright page.
 
 Thanks
 --
  Ramakrishnan</code></pre>
<p>The reply came a few hours later on the same day. Reproduced here with permission from Prof.&nbsp;Kernighan.</p>
<pre><code> Hi, Ramakrishnan --
 
 Thanks for the kind words on the typography.  The core formatting
 is just troff (groff, really) with the -ms macro package.  We
 tried Latex briefly but neither Alan or I care for its output, and
 I personally find it impossible to control.  Troff is the devil I
 know -- it's ugly and irregular in many ways but it will put
 characters where you want them.
 
 The input was in XML, with a tag set of about 25 items for
 headings, paragraphs, index terms, program insertion, simple
 tables, and the like.  A Go program converted this either into
 HTML for rapid viewing on the screen and potentially for an e-book
 version, or into troff for printing.  Using XML was a mild
 nuisance when writing but the error checking was very helpful.
 
 We wrote a variety of small Go programs and scripts to fix things
 up, including one that rewrites troff output to do vertical
 justification so all pages are the same height.  There is also
 some fiddling with the generated postscript to put on printer's
 marks.
 
 The fonts are Alan's choice, the result of a lot of work on his
 part to find them and get the right sizes and appearances.  The
 handful of Asian characters were tough to get right; troff doesn't
 do wide Unicode characters properly, and there are a few places
 where we rewrote text to hide that fact.
 
 The drawings are all Alan's work, using Google's drawing program.
 We toyed briefly with using pic but it wasn't really up to the
 job, and it would not have worked with HTML without a lot of work.
 We avoided mathematics beyond superscripts, and the tables are
 pretty limited; eqn and tbl would have been ok but again would not
 have dealt with HTML.
 
 We should probably write a more organized description of what we
 did and make the tools available, though I think most readers are
 less interested in the process than you (and I) are.  The other
 thing is that although one starts with grand ideas of being clean
 and orderly, by the end the process is somewhat of a mess, with
 a complicated makefile to keep it running.
 
 Thanks again for writing.
 
 Brian</code></pre>
<p>The last sentence certainly holds true for just about any project, as far as my experience goes.</p>
<pre><code>"...although one starts with grand ideas of being clean
 and orderly, by the end the process is somewhat of a mess, with
 a complicated makefile to keep it running."</code></pre>
<p>In a subsequent email, Prof.&nbsp;Kernighan added that the problem with Unicode was not much of an input problem and was because of troubles getting suitable fonts for actual printing.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="when-a-relationship-starts-with-an-act-of-dishonesty-or-manipulation-it-will-be-a-toxic-relationship"><em>When a relationship starts with an act of dishonesty or manipulation, it will be a toxic relationship</em>.</h2>
<p>This is common knowledge.</p>
<p>Most major web hosting companies groom potential customers in manipulative ways, but, sadly, many do not recognize the trouble signs due to naivety or need.</p>
<p>Here is one important, but common cue that your webhost-to-be will not respect you, and you are in for a compromising, dysfunctional relationship.</p>
<h2 id="but-you-said-395-a-month-">But you said 3.95 a month… :(</h2>
<h3 id="the-solicitation">The Solicitation</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/do-you-really-mean-it.jpg" alt="Do you really mean it?"></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200911190002/https://www.bluehost.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20200911190002/https://www.bluehost.com/</a></p>
<p>In the ad above, this average young woman has just been approached by what could be the prince-charming of webhosts, bluehost himself. She is excited and flattered that she could have him for the price of $3.50 a month.</p>
<p>Enticed, she takes the bait.</p>
<h3 id="getting-into-the-car">Getting into the Car</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/do-you-really-mean-it-2.jpg" alt="Is it too good to be true?"></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200910194510if_/https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared#pricing-cards">https://web.archive.org/web/20200910194510if_/https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared#pricing-cards</a></p>
<p>Now the young lady is excited, because although it seemed too good to be true, it looks like this might just be true love. $3.95 a month! Things are finally looking up.</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-ride">Taking the Ride</h3>
<p>After some flirty initial conversation of what her domain name will be, our prince charming bluehost finally gets down to his intentions.</p>
<p>He says, <strong>“So let’s talk about that $178.08…"</strong></p>
<p>And her heart sinks…</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/get-your-hands-off-me.jpg" alt="Get your hands off me!"></p>
<p>And now we’ve quickly arrived at that part of the relationship known as <em><strong>“Get your hands off me!"</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="17808-for-3-years-is-not-395-a-month">$178.08 for 3 Years is Not $3.95 a Month</h2>
<p>One might argue that if you divide the numbers over 3 years, it evens out to the price stated: $3.95.</p>
<p>But that’s <em>not</em> $3.95 a month.</p>
<p>That <em>is</em> $178.08 for three years.</p>
<p>If it was $3.95 a month, I could pay $3.95 for the first month, $3.95 for the second… $3.95 for the third … etc.</p>
<p>It was lie, a manipulation, a sign.</p>
<h3 id="my-wedding-ring-costs-less-per-month-every-year">My wedding ring costs less per month every year…</h3>
<p>So by this logic, a $1000 wedding ring costs $1.66 dollars a month after 50 years of marriage. Assuming there is no divorce.</p>
<h3 id="but-if-you-say-yes">But if you say yes…</h3>
<p>Sadly, some people will ignore the first alarm signs of the toxic relationship, and convince themselves that they did not just get manipulated.</p>
<p>Sadly, that “deal” is lost in a short time due to common upsells inherent to hosts such as this.  Because if you don’t say “get your hands off me” you enable future exploits, and the web host knows this. He’s good at what he does.</p>
<h3 id="prince-charming-is-a-dime-a-dozen">Prince Charming is a Dime a Dozen</h3>
<p>Despite how unique and valuable this prince charming purports to be, there is a street full of them coming from every alley way.</p>
<p>Most major cheap hosting companies operate this way.</p>
<p>Don’t give up your standards and settle. The good hosts are hard to find, because they don’t hang out in the main traffic areas of society/internet.</p>

          <p>Friends,</p>
          <p>On&nbsp;September 2, the Belarus government ordered searches to&nbsp;be&nbsp;conducted at&nbsp;the Minsk office of&nbsp;PandaDoc. During the search, more than 20 employees were prevented from leaving and 7 of&nbsp;them were taken into custody and detained for further interrogation. Some of&nbsp;these employees were subsequently taken into custody from their homes.</p>
          <p>Over the next two days, the Financial Investigation Department (FID) arm of&nbsp;the Belarus government interviewed more than one hundred company employees. During those two days, the employees that had been taken into custody were also denied the rights to&nbsp;legal counsel.</p>
          <p>Today, on&nbsp;September 4, 2020 we&nbsp;were told that a&nbsp;criminal case was retroactively initiated against PandaDoc employees under part 4 of&nbsp;article 210 of&nbsp;the Criminal Code of&nbsp;the Republic of&nbsp;Belarus. Our employees are accused of&nbsp;taking one hundred and seven thousand Belarusian rubles (~40k USD) from the corporate accounts of&nbsp;the company in&nbsp;Minsk abusing their positions, thus causing damage to&nbsp;the&nbsp;State. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, our employees have now been placed into custody for two months.</p>
          <p>We&nbsp;declare that this accusation by&nbsp;the State of&nbsp;Belarus is&nbsp;completely untrue and has no&nbsp;grounds.</p>
          <p>All the company’s activities in&nbsp;Belarus were conducted since its inception in&nbsp;full compliance with the&nbsp;law. Several international audits and inspections by&nbsp;EY&nbsp;and other reputable companies over the last years prove that the company adhered to&nbsp;all regulations and laws prevalent in&nbsp;Belarus.</p>
          <p>As&nbsp;recent events in&nbsp;Belarus have demonstrated, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common practice of&nbsp;the Belarusian government to&nbsp;oppress political opponents. In&nbsp;this case, the authorities have taken four completely innocent people hostage.</p>
          <p>This action is&nbsp;purely an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;repression against the founders of&nbsp;PandaDoc who have been supporting some of&nbsp;the victims of&nbsp;the Belarussian government in&nbsp;the weeks since the stolen Presidential election. The only purpose of&nbsp;this private initiative by&nbsp;Mikita and Sergey has been intended to&nbsp;help stop the violence and is&nbsp;in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way related to&nbsp;PandaDoc.</p>
          <p>In&nbsp;response the government has imprisoned:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Yulia Shardyko</strong>, Accountant</li>
            <li><strong>Dmitry Rabtsevich</strong>, Director - Minsk office</li>
            <li><strong>Viktar Kuushynau</strong>, Product Director</li>
            <li><strong>Vladislav Mikholap</strong>, HR</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The law in&nbsp;Belarus has ceased to&nbsp;exist. The authorities do&nbsp;not even bother to&nbsp;act according to&nbsp;the prevailing rules and laws of&nbsp;the country. The case and charges are fabricated cases upon political orders ordered from somewhere in&nbsp;the government. This affects everyone in&nbsp;Belarus.</p>
          <h2>We&nbsp;ask of&nbsp;you:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Record a&nbsp;video in&nbsp;our support with the tag <strong>#SavePandaDoc</strong>.</li>
            <li>To&nbsp;express your disagreement in&nbsp;the press, media and social networks with the <strong>#SavePandaDoc</strong> tag.</li>
            <li>Connect us&nbsp;to&nbsp;journalists and reporters that you&nbsp;know. Our contact is&nbsp;<a href="mailto:savepandadoc@gmail.com">savepandadoc@gmail.com</a>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We&nbsp;are hoping that maximum publicity will show solidarity and pressure to&nbsp;have our colleagues released.</p>

The sound of the NBC chimes is the sound of radio history itself.  Probably no single sound better recalls 
the golden age of radio.  The NBC chimes – the musical notes G-E-C – were played at the end of every 
NBC radio program beginning shortly after the network's inception, and continued in daily use on NBC radio and television 
until 1971. </p><p>
&nbsp;Shortly after the formation of the National Broadcasting Company
in 1926, network executives became aware of confusion among the
affiliate stations as to the exact when a program ended, and when it
was safe to cut away for local announcements. The problem was assigned
to a committee of three: Oscar B. Hanson, NBC's Director of Engineer
and a former AT&amp;T engineer; Earnest la Prada, an NBC orchestra
leader; and Phillips Carlin, an NBC announcer. They decided that a
musical signal of some kind would be an appropriate way to indicate the
ending of all programs. At that time, it was common for radio stations
to use the sounds of chimes, gongs, sirens and other mechanical devices
as a signature sound for their station, so the choice of a chime by NBC
was not unusual or particularly innovative. There is in fact some
evidence that the chimes may have been inspired by a similar chime
sequence used at that time by NBC affiliate WSB in Atlanta. </p><p>

During 1927 and 1928, the committee experimented with several combinations of notes.  A seven-note 
sequence which was first used, G-C-F-E-G-C-E, was determined to be too complicated for the announcers to 
play correctly on a consistent basis.  It was first simplified to G-C-F-E, and finally to just G-E-C.  This familiar 
sequence was heard for the first time on November 29, 1929.</p><p>

The chimes were sounded at :29:30 and :59:30 of each hour, to indicate the start 
of the 30 second local station break. They were initially struck by hand by the 
announcer, using a set of hand-held chimes held up to the microphone.<span face="Times New Roman">
</span>
<span>
But, there were inconsistencies in the chimes' tempo, volume, and exact timing.&nbsp; </span>
<span face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I</span>t was finally determined that the 
best way to solve these problems was for the chimes to be generated 
mechanically.</p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Schematic" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimach.gif" height="480" width="430"><p>&nbsp;<img alt="Chimes Machine" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes2b.jpg" height="480" width="640"></p>
<p>&gt;
</p></center>

The man who designed the chimes machine was 
Captain Richard H. Ranger, who was also the inventor of the electronic organ and the RCA facsimile.  
Ranger created a device resembling a music box, where fingers on a revolving drum plucked a set of reeds.  
There were three sets of eight reeds, one for each note, allowing the generation of the fundamental note 
plus several overtones.   Each reed formed one plate of a capacitor in an oscillator circuit, and the signal 
generated by all reeds was amplified by a single 6C6 pentode tube.  It was activated by a timer,
which would cut off the program two seconds before its end (whether it was finished or 
not!) and feed the chimes to the network. <p>

NBC built a limited number of chime machines. NBC in San Francisco  had two of them - the main and backup 
machines.  Others were installed ain other cities around the country where network programs were originated 
– Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and perhaps a few others.  It is likely that not more than a dozen chimes 
machines were ever made. </p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Inside View" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes5b.jpg"><p>&nbsp;<img alt="Chimes Machine Name Tag" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes7b.jpg" height="349" width="512"></p>
</center>

The photos on this page show one of the few chime machines still in existence, now in the hands of a private 
collector.  (NBC had the short-sighted habit of discarding large quantities of historical artifacts throughout 
its history.  It's only through the far-sightedness of a few NBC employees, who saved some of these items 
from the trash bins, that we can today experience many recorded programs, photos, and other memorabilia from 
that era.)
<p>

&nbsp;The unit shown is the chimes machine serial number 2, probably from the first group ever made.   Its mechanical 
parts, although finely crafted, appear to have been hand made.  This unit is no doubt the original chimes machine 
placed in operation at NBC's studios at 111 Sutter Street in San Francisco.  The schematic diagram, 
also shown, indicates that serial number 5 was fabricated in 1933, so this machine would have 
predated it.  The main cabinet contains the motor drive reed mechanism and amplifier, which is accessed by  
removing the front panel's four thumbscrews.  The unit operated from an external power source, no doubt the same 
battery and motor generator system that operated the audio amplifiers in the studios.   The smaller box 
contains the timer and switches that operate the chimes for both studio and "NEMO" broadcast lines.  
("NEMO" was a term used in early radio to indicate a remote broadcast.  It comes from a telephone term, 
and stands for "Not Emanating Main Office".)  The chime machine could be operated in an automatic mode by 
the clock, which was the usual method of operation, or manually by the announcer in the event of programs 
with imprecise ending times, such as sports broadcasts. 
</p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Timer" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes4b.jpg" height="458" width="640"></center>

&nbsp;<p>The NBC chimes were officially registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1950 as a registered service mark, the first 
known case of a sound receiving trademark protection.  They were last heard regularly on NBC 
television in 1976, used to mark the 50th anniversary of the network. </p>

<div>
  
  <p>Here is a remembrance of the NBC 
  Chimes Machine from Rick Greenhut - February 3, 2013:</p>
  
  <p>
  <span>John,</span></p></div>

<p>
<span>Just saw your 
page on the Bay Area Radio Museum dedicated to the NBC chimes machine, and I 
wanted to give you another historical fact to add. In 1969 when I went to work 
as a summer replacement engineer (board op) at NBC-owned WKYC Cleveland, there 
was still a chimes machine back in the racks. Since all the O&amp;O's originated 
programs like NOTH (New On The Hour) and Monitor inserts, they all had 2 chimes 
machines. Besides WNBC/New York, WMAQ/Chicago and KNBR/San Francisco, 
WKYC/Cleveland and WRC/Washington also had chimes machines.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>By the next 
  summer I worked there, the chimes machine was gone - whether thrown away or 
  taken home by one of the old-timers, I couldn't say.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>Last bit of 
  radio trivia: I was doing Affiliate Relations for the NBC Radio Network in 
  August of 1987, and during the NABET engineers strike those of us in 
  management with technical backgrounds were taking shifts running the board for 
  the NOTH and manning the ROD (Radio Operations Desk) in Radio Central (network 
  master control). I was the first management person on the board when the 
  engineers walked out at 6:00 AM that morning, and engineered the 6, 7, 8 and 9 
  AM NOTH (the talent was Gary Nunn, now heard on the CBS Radio Network). At 
  8:30 that morning I was told by the General Manager, Craig Simon, that the 
  network had been sold to Westwood One, and that the chimes were not part of 
  the sale, so I was forbidden to play them at the end of the newscast like we 
  usually did.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>I ignored 
  him, and "chimed out" at the end of the 9:00 AM newscast as per usual. He came 
  up to the studio a few minutes later with a funny smile on his face, and told 
  me to make sure no one else did that. I made sure by taking the chimes cart 
  and backup out of the studio. I bulked the backup, and have the last remaining 
  cart with the NBC chimes (recorded directly from the WNBC chimes machine) in 
  my collection.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>I was the 
  last person to play the chimes on the NBC Radio Network.</span></p>

<h2>From Vim to Ed</h2>
<p>I switched from Vim to Ed twelve months ago,
and I wanted to report my findings on this
strange downstream adventure I took.</p>

<p>I’d been using Vim since about 1998, and I
hardly got close to mastering it after all those
years. In fact, that was one of the reasons I
thought of trying something like Ed: I was tired
of turning a corner only to find a zillion other
great features Vim offers.</p>

<p>I wanted to use an editor that didn’t have
features that were constantly distracting me
from what’s important: writing code.</p>

<h3>The goods</h3>


<p>Ed had one of the most fantastically steep learning
curves in all my many years of nerding. This ol’
editor was so weird in so many ways, I almost
lost heart right off the bat.</p>

<p>A good deal of the Ed ideas are forgotten
in time.  Nobody uses a line-based editor,
so this was one strange playing field to get
accustomed to.</p>

<p>However, once the learning curve was overcome,
the terseness of what I could do became an asset.</p>

<p>In Vim, there’s a million different ways to
get your cursor to zip all around. One of my
favorites was <code>w</code> where on the line in question,
all in normal mode, I could dart over to my
change in word-step motion.</p>

<p>In Ed, the line in question is right there in
front of you, and all you have is ‘regex’ as
your weapon to swap one thing for another.</p>

<p>You’d be surprised how good one can get via
this sole usage pattern. It’s not all that bad,
and thankfully, some distributions of Ed have
nice little shortcuts to make this all the
less pedantic.</p>

<p>With only a few agilities, Ed limits your usage
to x, y, or z. The result?  You get so darn good
at those.</p>

<p>Another powerful plus for Ed, is its undo/redo
limitation.</p>

<p>Usually, one would think, that after some
hacking, one would want to undo changes that
happened twenty edits ago. In Vim, you’d just
hold down <code>u</code> until it gets to that state. In Ed,
the buffer is limited to one undo. Incredibly,
this limitation has never ruined my day. Because
of my for-knowledge that Ed can’t undo twenty
edits ago, my approach on edits has been
‘Edified,’ and my behavior is in sync with this
one undo world.</p>

<p>I don’t pop open Vim ever, except to run a spell
check on something that isn’t code (like this
blog post, for example). Fascinating to me:
one of the side effects of Ed is my spelling
got a lot better. I’m more careful about what
I type, as the pain to undo or edit things is
quite real. Go figure!</p>

<h3>The bads</h3>


<p>Vim offers so much, it’s hard to
compare Ed to something this feature-rich. So,
I won’t.</p>

<p>Rather, I’ll just jot down some of my Ed-related
gripes.</p>

<p>First, one can scroll forward a page via <code>z</code>
in Ed, but one cannot do the reciprocal. I
was so bummed out on day one regarding this,
and I’m still bummed out 365 days later. What I
find shocking, is that <abbr>UNIX</abbr> <code>mail</code> has <code>z</code> to go
forward a page in header listings, and also <code>-z</code>
to go back a page. If only this was baked into
Ed from the start. My workaround is terrible,
and funny as it may sound, when I’m fatigued,
I sometimes try <code>-z</code> to see if it magically
started working.</p>

<p>Perhaps more of a gripe to the authors of <code>sed</code>
rather than Ed, but I wish there was a 100%
compatibility with ‘regex’ substitution patterns
that are valid in Ed, but in <code>sed</code>. This is
not the case, and it’s a shame. In general,
one has to forget about Ed’s awesome shorthand
tricks to get <code>sed</code> to work. It would be great
if the bounty of Ed vocabulary I’ve built up
just simply worked one-for-one in <code>sed</code>.</p>

<h3>More Ed for me</h3>


<p>One year dedicated to Ed is probably enough time
to arrive at a plateau of know-how where the
limitations will remain as such, and the pains
can’t be overcome with any more learning. That
said, I think I’ve arrived at a comfortable spot
with Ed, and I’m going to stick it out with it!</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>Thanks to Clint Gibler, Grayson Hardaway, and Pablo Estrada at r2c for their contributions to this piece. And thanks to r2c for contracting me to write it! This article is cross-posted on <a href="https://jacobian.org/2020/sep/11/analyzing-dos-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jacobian.org</a>.</em></p>
<p>When I ran the security team at Heroku, I had this recurring nightmare: my PagerDuty alarm goesoff, alerting me to some sort of security incident. In my dream, I’d look at my phone and realize “oh no, this is the big one” — and then I’d wake up.</p>
<p>I’m still not sure exactly what the attack in my dream was, but it may very well have been a <em>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</em> attack. DoS attacks are simple but can be devastating: an attacker crafts and sends traffic to your app in a way that overwhelms your servers. While this is arguably not as bad as a remote code execution or a data breach, it’s still pretty terrible. If your customers can’t use your app, you’ll lose their money and their trust.</p>
<p>Typically, we talk about two kinds of Denial-of-Service attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Normal” Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, where a single machine is sufficient to cause downtime. The classic, old-school version of this attack is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zip bomb</a>: an attacker tricks your server into expanding a specially-crafted ZIP file that is tiny compressed but expands to entirely fill your disk space.</li>
<li>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks rely on an attacker sending a huge flood of traffic to your site from multiple machines (that’s the “Distributed” part). Often, these attacks come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botnets</a> — fleets of compromised machines controlled by an attacker. These botnets are available to purchase in certain corners of the Internet, making a DDoS attack well within the reach of anyone with a credit card.</li>
</ol>
<p>Engineers who work on web applications frequently run into vulnerabilities that could be used in a DoS/DDoS attack. Unfortunately, there’s broad disagreement in the industry about how to treat these vulnerabilities. The risk can be difficult to analyze: I’ve seen development teams argue for <em>weeks</em> over how to handle a DoS vector.</p>
<p>This article tries to cut through those arguments. It provides a framework for engineering and application security teams to think about denial-of-service risk, breaks down DoS vulnerabilities into high-, medium-, and low-risk classes, and has recommendations for mitigations at each layer.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this post is on the big picture, and should apply to any kind of web app. But to make things concrete, I’ve added a few specific Django-related examples. (I helped create it, so it’s what I’m most familiar with.)</p>
<h2>Evaluating Denial-of-Service Risk</h2>
<p>Evaluating the risk of a DoS vulnerability at the application layer can be difficult. There’s widespread disagreement among security professionals: you’ll often see two different appsec teams treat similar issues very differently.</p>
<p>Some argue: it’s nearly impossible to entirely mitigate against a focused DDoS — a dedicated enough attacker can throw more bandwidth at you than your app can handle. You can never fully mitigate a DDoS attack without serious support from an upstream network provider with specific tools to protect bot attacks (e.g., Cloudflare). Thus, chasing and fixing hypothetical DoS vulnerabilities can seem like a waste of developer time. These teams treat most potential DoS vectors as acceptable risk, and focus their energy at preparing mitigations at the network level.</p>
<p>Other teams point out that the traditional risk model has three potential problem areas: Confidentiality, Integrity, and <em>Availability</em>. We’ve long understood that uptime is a security issue. It’s becoming increasingly common for attackers to take a service down and then demand a ransom to stop the attack. The recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack against Garmin</a> is a highly notable example; attackers took down nearly all of Garmin’s services, and reportedly demanded US $1 million to stop the attack. (In this case the attack was ransomware, but it’s easy to see how a DoS attack could have a similar effect). Thus, DoS vulnerabilities are risks like any other, and it’s easy to understand the argument that they should all be mitigated.</p>
<p>It’s important to recognize that both of these positions are valid! It’s reasonable to see DoS as out-of-scope for application security; it’s similarly reasonable to scope it in. I’ve often seen security teams get completely stuck arguing between these two positions. Since neither is “right” or “wrong”, it can be impossible to figure out how to move forward.</p>
<h3><strong>How I decide: <em>attacker leverage</em></strong></h3>
<p>The model I use to cut through this argument is the concept of <em>attacker leverage</em>. Levers amplify force: a small amount of force applied to the long end of the lever is multiplied at the short end. In the context of a DoS attack, if a vulnerability has <em>high leverage</em> it means attackers can consume a ton of your server resources with minimal resources.</p>
<p>For example, if a bug in your web app allows a single <code>GET</code> request to consume 100% CPU, that’s a terrific amount of leverage. Just a small handful of attacks, and your web servers will grind to a halt. A <em>low leverage</em> vulnerability, on the other hand, requires a high amount of attacker resources to cause minor availability degradation. If an attacker has to spend thousands of dollars to bring a single server to its knees, you can probably scale up faster than they can.</p>
<p>The higher the leverage, the higher the risk, and the more likely I am to address the issue directly. The lower the leverage, the more likely I’ll accept the risk and/or lean on network-level mitigations.</p>
<p>Let’s get specific. I’ve broken down DoS risk into high, medium, and low risk classes, based on leverage. For each class, I’ll look at how to recognize that a vulnerability falls into this class, discuss a few examples, and give some suggestions for mitigation.</p>
<h2>High leverage DoS vulnerabilities: easily-amplified resource starvation</h2>
<p>The classic high-risk DoS vulnerability is one where an attacker can cause resource starvation using very little resources themselves. This could mean exhaustion of any number of types of resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> — e.g., a vulnerability that magnifies uploaded data and fills the disk, as in the case of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zip bomb</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Network bandwidth</strong> — e.g., a vulnerability that amplifies input traffic, where a single incoming request consumes tons of bandwidth, causing network starvation. I’ve seen this happen with a bug in a microservices system, where a single incoming request triggered millions of internal API requests (including moving some fairly large files around the network), and choked off the internal network bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>CPU utilization</strong> — e.g., an exploit that triggers an <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accidentally quadratic</a> algorithm, causing web servers to grind to a halt.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency limits</strong> — most servers have a maximum concurrency limit (e.g., max threads or processes, or max connections for a database); an exploit that causes a process to run very slowly (or never exit) can cause the server to hit those limits and start rejecting requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, the unifying factor is that a bug in the application will allow significant amplification.</p>
<h3><strong>Authentication affects risk</strong></h3>
<p>When considering the risk of a resource amplification DoS vector, an important factor is the level of authentication required to trigger the vulnerability.
If a completely anonymous user can easily trigger a resource starvation attack, it’ll be extremely easy for an attacker to bring you to your knees. Unauthenticated DoS vectors should be considered very high risk.
On the other hand, if only users who authenticate against your corporate Single Sign-On server can trigger the vulnerability, it’s far lower risk. Most attackers aren’t insiders (though, some are!). And, if an attack does occur, it’s easy to attribute and block. In many cases, “we can attribute and block this attack” is a reasonable, if not complete, mitigation strategy.
Many vulnerabilities fall between these two extremes: most services make creating new accounts fairly trivial (e.g., you just need an email address). This does give minimal ability to attribute and block, but often not enough.</p>
<h3><strong>Mitigation recommendation: eliminate</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, I recommend that this class of DoS vulnerabilities — especially unauthenticated ones — be treated as high risk, and eliminated. If exploited, these vulnerabilities can be devastating; they allow a single attacker to completely overwhelm your app. I’d put the same level of effort into finding and eliminating these kinds of bugs that I do other high-risk security vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.</p>
<h3><strong>An example high-leverage vulnerability: ReDoS</strong></h3>
<p>A common example of this last type of resource starvation, concurrency limits, is the <em>regular expression denial-of-service</em>, aka <em>ReDoS</em>. ReDoS bugs occur when certain types of strings can cause improperly crafted regular expressions to perform extremely poorly. These types of vulnerabilities are unfortunately relatively common in Python; the built-in regular expression module (<code>re</code>) has no inherent protection against them (unlike libraries like <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, Go’s built-in regex module, and thus renders the language more or less immune to this class of attack).
(Django itself has had several of these vulnerabilities over the years; for example, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/aug/01/security-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-14232 and CVE-2019-14233</a> were both ReDoS vulnerabilities).
In Django, these vulnerabilities most often show up in two places: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#using-regular-expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regex-based URL parsing</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/validators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom validators</a>, and more broadly anywhere an application uses regular expressions. Luckily, this class of vulnerabilities are fairly easy to find; see the following r2c articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/finding-python-redos-bugs-at-scale-using-dlint-and-r2c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finding Python ReDoS bugs at scale using Dlint and r2c</a>, and</li>

</ul>
<p>If you’re using Python, you can easily scan for ReDoS in your application using Semgrep, which has ReDoS detection ported from Dlint. The detection requires some extra logic written using Semgrep’s powerful pattern-where-python clause, which enables rules to leverage the full power of Python, …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>Expertise is less about knowledge and more about observing things that elude novices. Through training, experts learn to see, taste, smell, and hear things that the rest of us can’t, therefore allowing them to perceive the world differently. This became clear to me after spending a weekend in conversation with an expert winemaker in Napa Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wine tasting is a peculiar profession (and not just because critics spit $50 mouthfuls into a bucket). Sommeliers can sound like they’re speaking in a strange <a href="https://www.robertparker.com/resources/glossary-terms">foreign language</a>. Wines are said to possess “roundness, generosity, and depth.” Their aromas are berrylike (strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, blackberry, whatever berry), further containing hints of tobacco, vanilla, leather, and plum. Other aroma labels don’t sound like they belong in food, like “<a href="http://www.mustwineblog.com/blog/2015/1/15/the-10-most-ridiculous-wine-descriptors">pencil shavings</a>,” “<a href="https://www.awri.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Sept-Oct-2012-AWRI-Report.pdf">petrol</a>,” and—wait for it—“<a href="https://timatkin.com/cork-talk/cats-pee/">cat’s piss</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all these things cannot possibly be in a glass of wine, can they?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lyrical waxing of wine experts is hard to buy in its sincerity. Even poets like Kingsley Amis mocked their manners: “When I find someone I respect writing about an edgy, nervous wine that dithered in the glass, I cringe. When I hear someone that I don’t respect talk about an austere, unforgiving wine, I turn a bit austere and unforgiving myself … You can call a wine red, and dry, and strong and pleasant. After that, watch out…”</p>



  




<p>Lots of people think of wine tasting as a <a href="https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/08/the_most_infamous_study_on_wine_tasting.html">scam</a>. But wine tasting is a true scientific art—it’s just that words sometimes get in the way of it being taken seriously. Gasoline-smelling wines do not contain petrol per se—we hope—but often share compounds with another substance with a recognizable aroma. The brains of sommeliers learn how to link categories of sensory experience (i.e., “this smells like petrol”) to qualitative categories of specific chemical compounds. Aged Riesling, for example, contains <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22397689/">TDN</a> (short for 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene), a compound with the aroma of petrol. TDN is a result of carotenoids (organic pigments found in many foods, including grapes) breaking down, a process accelerated by higher temperatures. Many odd wine descriptors, including “rubber hose” and—yes—“cat’s piss,” can be identified as a specific chemical compound by expert noses. In the case of cat’s piss, it’s the compound  pyrazine found in Sauvignon Blanc.</p>



<p>Wine has several hundred aroma compounds, which is more molecular information than most of our brains have the ability to compute. Sommeliers have learned how to direct their sensory spotlight to identify specific compounds in a complex mixture. They have trained themselves to be extremely good at discriminating and identifying individual aromas and aroma patterns. The best wine experts can identify a vintage down to its specific vineyard and even year with a virtuosity that can occasionally take less than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKNmcCCE15E">a minute</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acquiring this skillset not only makes sommeliers a knowledgeable (if not sometimes exasperating) dinner-party guest. It actually alters the structure and activity of their brains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218303356">the brain of a mathematician</a> with that of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4992723/">sommelier</a>, we find remarkable similarities. In both cases, the cellular density of white and gray matter in designated areas increases. Whether it’s sniffing Syrah or performing calculus, the acquisition of expertise makes&nbsp; parts of the brain thicker. In mathematicians, for example, one of the most prominent changes in the density of gray matter is found in the superior frontal gyrus, an area also linked with the coordination of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306002121">self-awareness</a> and, most intriguing, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35536">laughter</a>. In comparison, changes in sommeliers’ brain volume were found in the right insula and entorhinal cortex, areas that are notably involved in memory processing. Such changes in neural density give those areas enhanced cortical connectivity and signaling speed, as the synaptic connections by which neurons communicate become more tightly packed. A consequence of increased neural density is that dedicated specialized areas of the brain better integrate and orchestrate otherwise widespread neural activity. Expertise of any kind results in a more sophisticated communication architecture of the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here’s the paradox. When an expert’s brain grows, they also use less of it. The more proficient you are at wine tasting, the less activity we’ll see in your brain’s <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00358/full">fMRI recording</a>, as reported in a scientific study from 2014. If you’re processing more information, though, how are you using your brain less? This observation is less puzzling if you compare your brain to the body of an athlete. You’ll need to put in less overall effort to lift weights if your body is trained to do so routinely. With practice, some brain activities become “automatized” and, according to the neuroscientist Christof Koch, resemble a “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35082161">zombie agent</a>”—meaning these processes require less and less conscious effort and attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So do sommeliers become merely better at memorizing patterns, like in the legendary study of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/london-taxi-memory/">hippocampi in London cab drivers</a>, or do they also get better at the sensory part of smelling itself? The answer is both. Notably, a sommelier’s skill is not exclusively a method of memory (<em>this</em> is what a Cabernet Sauvignon typically smells like, and <em>that</em> is the aroma profile of a Barolo). Training further enhances their ability to be more receptive to aromas in a mixture: the sensitivity to odors changes with repeated exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Whether it’s sniffing Syrah or performing calculus, the acquisition of expertise makes&nbsp; parts of the brain thicker.</p></blockquote>



<p>Yet the real surprise is this: The previously mentioned 2014 fMRI study on expert sommeliers suggests that sensory expertise <em>modifies your experience of reality</em>—it affects not just the ability to identify and recall things on a cognitive level, but also consciousness itself. During tasting, the scientists observed activation in the brain stem of experts but not in novices. This finding (which is still being further explored) implies a difference in how sensory information is integrated into the cortical cognitive activity of experts and novices. Engaging with your perception on an analytical level thus makes a difference in the quality of your experience by fine-tuning your brain to its input (and having it reorganize its neural story to match).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hold that thought: You get more control of the quality and content of your own conscious experience … by thinking while drinking wine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet we hesitate to trust sommeliers’ abilities. That’s because of our outmoded views of mind and brain, particularly our understanding of the senses. The philosopher <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/">René Descartes</a>, the influential source of so many misled thoughts about the mind, famously claimed that you could not <a href="https://twitter.com/CliffordSosis/status/1299421713965494276?s=20">trust</a> your senses. He believed that the existence of illusions proved the unreliability of perception, and that it is impossible to establish a difference in the experience of dreams and reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Descartes’ skepticism led him as far as to doubt whether our entire experience may just be a hallucination induced by an evil demon. And you can’t trust your senses to reflect reality, neither by referring to what you see and hear or smell, nor by any other empirical observation. (Although demons are said to come with a pungent odor.) For Descartes, the only assurance of our material existence was the use of pure analytic reason—<em>I think, therefore I am</em>. The irrefutable truth from which all other truths must follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Except Descartes was wrong. Our senses do not “deceive” us. They are built on experience. That experience can vary through our engagement with the world, and therefore different people see, taste, hear, smell, and feel the world differently. There isn’t one shared reality that all conscious beings observe; the wine tastes different to all of us, despite the drop in our glass being from the same bottle. The dress is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">black and blue</a>. I heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanny_or_Laurel">Laurel, not Yanny.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows how perception is markedly <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/14721/">dynamic</a>. That insight amounts to more than saying that you create your own reality. As sensory expertise enrichens the content of conscious awareness, you perceive <em>more</em> of the world, not just differently.</p>



<p>The acquisition of expertise broadens your perspective—and not only on the particular thing you specialize in. Acquiring expertise has the hidden benefit of developing a cognitive meta-skill: you learn how to learn. Such a skill provides a scaffold—both sensory and cognitive—to approach learning about other areas you may not be sufficiently familiar with. Knowing one thing well allows you to branch out to other things without getting lost in the process. Knowledge develops with experience, and experience develops with knowledge. Or as Eleanor Roosevelt said: “When you are genuinely interested in one thing, it will always lead to something else.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>While mulling over old papers and hacking away at their computers, scholars build up an intimate knowledge about their research topic. As they chart their way through idea space, they develop a deep intuition on which techniques work well in practice. Unfortunately, many of these hard-earned insights are not published and remain obscure.</p>
<p>Last year, I took a course at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria on the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks. There, Sepp Hochreiter shared some of the “magic tricks” he and his team employ for training LSTMs. This blog post is the accumulation of some of my notes.</p>
<p>For this post, I assume you are already familiar with LSTMs. If not, I suggest you begin with Chris Olah’s <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Understanding LSTM Networks</a> and then go on to read the original LSTM work <span data-cites="hochreiter1997long">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber <a href="#ref-hochreiter1997long" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I’d also like to highlight some resources that are similar in their motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrej Karpathy’s <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">general recipe for training neural networks</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>In case you want to experiment with some of the presented techniques and you need a flexible Pytorch-based LSTM implementation, I recommend Michael Widrich’s <a href="https://github.com/widmi/widis-lstm-tools">LSTM Tools library</a>.</p>
<p>All credits for the presented techniques go to the authors. All errors in their presentation are mine. I am always keen to receive feedback.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-lstm">Vanilla LSTM</h2>
<p>The <em>Vanilla LSTM</em> is one of the most prevalent variants and is often the default LSTM architecture in popular software libraries. It is characterized by three gates and a memory state – the gates provide the model with capacity and protect the memory cells from distracting information and noise; they make the dynamics of the LSTM highly non-linear and allow it to learn to perform complex operations.</p>
<p>Let us briefly step through the Vanilla LSTM’s mechanics to introduce the notation and terminology used in this post. Sensory inputs <span>\(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\)</span> flowing into the LSTM cell at a given time step are transformed into the <em>cell input activation</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> – the elements of <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> are activated by a non-linear function <span>\(g(\cdot)\)</span>, which in practice is often defined as the <em>hyperbolic tangent</em> or <em>tanh</em>. Information that is irrelevant for the current time step is removed by multiplying <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> element-wise by a sigmoid-activated <em>input gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{i}(t)\)</span>. Similarily, the <em>cell state</em> of the previous time step <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span> is partially erased using a sigmoid-activated <em>forget gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{f}(t)\)</span>. The new memory cell state <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> is computed by adding the current cell state update <span>\(\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> to the the filtered old state <span>\(\boldsymbol{f}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span>. Finally, the LSTM squashes the memory contents into a specific numerical range using the <em>memory cell activation function</em> <span>\(h(\cdot)\)</span> and filters the result through an <em>output gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{o}(t)\)</span>. This results in the final <em>memory cell state activation</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the Vanilla LSTM can be defined by the following set of equations:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{i}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{i}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{i}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{o}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{o}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{o}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{f}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{f}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{f}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right)  \\
\boldsymbol{z}(t) &amp;= g\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{z}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{z}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{c}(t) &amp;= \boldsymbol{f}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)+\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t) \\
\boldsymbol{y}(t) &amp;= \boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot h(\boldsymbol{c}(t))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span>\(\sigma\)</span> denotes the sigmoid activation function and <span>\(\odot\)</span> the element-wise or Hadamard product. Note that each of the gates has access to the current input <span>\(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\)</span> and the previous cell state activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also remember, that the weights <span>\(W\)</span> and recurrent weights <span>\(R\)</span> are shared between time steps.</p>

<h3 id="input-activation-functions-and-the-drift-effect">Input Activation Functions and the Drift Effect</h3>
<p>In practice, the input activation function <span>\(g\)</span> is often chosen to be tanh. But this choice is non-obvious and in fact, in the original LSTM paper sigmoid was used to activate <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}\)</span>. As the memory cell’s purpose is to learn and memorise patterns over time, sigmoid activations are a natural choice to indicate the presence (activation with a value close to <span>\(1\)</span>) or absence (activation with a value close to <span>\(0\)</span>) of entities in the input. Tanh on the other hand with a lower bound of <span>\(-1\)</span> doesn’t seem to make intuitive sense. What is a negative pattern? Does an activation with value <span>\(-1\)</span> indicate that something is strongly not present in the input?</p>
<p>The adoption of tanh first required two mental shifts. First, tanh makes intuitive sense in a meta-learning setting. Instead of patterns, we now use memory cells to store the weights for another neural network. To indicate whether the values of the weights should be increased or decreased we need both positive and negative values.</p>
<p>The second intuitive interpretation is the storage of <em>hints</em>. A hint in this context is evidence in favour of or against something. Consider an example from text analysis. Assume that a model encounters the words “Team”, “Player” and “Goal” in a paragraph. These are all strong hints that the text is about sports, but if the next passage includes the words “Manager”, “Revenue” and “Shareholder” it is a strong indication that the paragraph actually describes a business context. Positive values can be seen as hints in favour of and negative values as hints against certain classes.</p>
<p>But there is a simple mathematical reason why tanh is the preferred choice to activate the cell input. Compared to commonly used activation functions such as ReLU and sigmoid the expected value of the cell input activation is zero for tanh (under the assumption of zero-mean Gaussian pre-activations):</p>
<p><span>\[\mathbb{E}(\boldsymbol{z}(t)) = 0\]</span></p>
<p>To understand why this property is desirable, remember how the cell state is updated at a given time step<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span>\[\boldsymbol{c}(t) = \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\color{#9900ff}{+\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t)}\]</span></p>
<p>At each time step we add the cell input activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> (filtered by the input gate) to the previous cell state <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span>. If we choose an activation function for <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}\)</span>, such that each activation has a value <span>\(\geq 0\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;sigmoid, ReLU, etc.), <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> will quickly take on very large values. Even if the activations are relatively small, the cell state will grow large for sufficiently long sequences. This problem is known as the <em>drift effect</em>.</p>
<p>But how can large memory cell states become a hindrance to learning? To answer this question, we need to take a look at the LSTM’s backward pass:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)} &amp;=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)} \color{#9900ff}{\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)}}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)} \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)} \\
&amp;=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)} \operatorname{diag}\left(\boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot \color{#9900ff}{h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t))}\right)+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The equation recursively sums up all error signals from the future and carries them backwards in time. Intuitively, it describes the different ways in which the cell state at time <span>\(t\)</span> influences the loss <span>\(L\)</span>. We take a closer look at the highlighted term <span>\(\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t) / \partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> , which describes how the memory cell state activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t)\)</span> changes as <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> changes. The partial derivative can be obtained by calculating <span>\(\operatorname{diag}\left(\boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t))\right)\)</span>. And now we are in trouble. Remember that we use the tanh as the memory cell activation function <span>\(h\)</span> to squash the memory cell state into the numerical range <span>\((-1, 1)\)</span>. Its derivative is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[
h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \text{tanh}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{x}}) = 1 - \text{tanh}²(\boldsymbol{x})

<p>Now if <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> grows very large due to the drift effect, the highlighted term in the second equation will evaluate to <span>\(h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t)) = 1-1 = 0\)</span> for each element in <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span>. As a result, <span>\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y(t)} \frac{\partial y(t)}{\partial c(t)}\)</span> will be zero and the cell state loses its ability to influence …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A programmer is not someone who types super fast (yes, you have been fooled by movies and TV series).</p>
<p>Programming is about problem-solving.</p>
<p>Most of the time, a programmer is thinking about the problem and how to solve it.</p>
<p>Problem-solving is a skill that requires creativity.</p>
<p>And just like any other skill, it can be learned.</p>
<p>The best way to learn is to practice with different problems and projects.</p>
<p>Solving different problems will teach you different skills.</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much about syntax, you can always google it if you don’t remember, but the reasoning behind solving a problem is something you have to develop by yourself.</p>
<p>The general problem-solving flow is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze and understand the problem</li>
<li>What are the inputs</li>
<li>What is the required output</li>
<li>Plan the solution</li>
<li>Break the problem into smaller parts </li>
<li>Break the parts into tasks</li>
<li>If you get stuck, step back a little and rethink your approach</li>
<li>Test the solution</li>
<li>Fix errors that might appear, face them like challenges, not annoyances </li>
<li>Iterate the steps until success</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming teaches you to think better.</p>
<h2>Problem-Solving flow</h2>
<p>A program doesn’t exist without a goal.</p>
<p>You code because someone in your company or an external client requested a solution for a problem they have.</p>
<p>Developing a system is a project and as such, must be treated as one.</p>
<p>You have a new project to develop, a new program, there some important things you should check before coding to maximize the chances of success of your endeavor.</p>
<p>The first thing is:</p>
<h3>Stakeholders and their problems</h3>
<p>Ask yourself: who is using this program? what for? what problem do they have that I am solving?</p>
<p>Stakeholders can be your boss, a client, or the actual person who is going to use the program, the so-called end-user.</p>
<p>Talk to these people.</p>
<p>Don’t assume you know what they need, you will waste time and resources and feel frustrated when you find out that what you built does not fill the gap as needed.</p>
<p>Take notes in an organized way of everything they tell you.</p>
<p>These notes will turn into the second thing:</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Every software has requirements like: </p>
<ul>
<li>"I must be able to manage my customer data"</li>
<li>"I need the input X to become output Y"</li>
<li>"I have thousands of spreadsheets with sales information and want to know how much did we profit monthly on average in the last 5 years combining their data"</li>
</ul>
<p>Analyze and understand the problem and turn it into requirements you have to fulfill, describe in words what has to be done for your program to be successful.</p>
<p>The third step is to:</p>
<h3>Break down the requirements into tasks</h3>
<p>The requirement "I have thousands of spreadsheets with sales information and want to know how much did we profit monthly on average in the last 5 years combining their data" translates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a way to input/import all the spreadsheets</li>
<li>Process the data to get only what is related to sales profit, since the spreadsheets have a bunch of information I don’t need such as names and addresses</li>
<li>Group the sales profit by month and average them</li>
<li>I have to output another spreadsheet with the result</li>
</ul>
<p>With these written down, you have a clear path on what to do and you are able to track your progress and report it back to the stakeholders and show them you are advancing in each task.</p>
<p>If your requirement includes a screen or a form in a website, you can also draw a rough sketch of how it is going to look like, which field goes where, to serve as a model.</p>
<p>You then discuss these tasks and sketches with the stakeholders to check if you understood the problem well and if you are on the right track.</p>
<p>This is a good point to find some mistakes and correct the direction before wasting resources coding a solution.</p>
<p>The fourth step is to:</p>
<h3>Design and code your solution</h3>
<p>Now you can work on your code.</p>
<p>Define which libraries you will need, which functions should you create, what approach should you use.</p>
<p>This varies a lot from programmer to programmer, my solution will differ from yours and they will be both right.</p>
<p>There is no single solution to a problem in programming.</p>
<p>The fifth step is to:</p>
<h3>Test and iterate</h3>
<p>First, test it on your own and check your test cases.</p>
<p>In the example of the spreadsheets, you can try to use just a few files, say 3, to check if your code outputs the same results that you achieved but doing the process manually.</p>
<p>Doing the process manually is simply taking each spreadsheet and making the process of taking the average monthly profit by hand, just like the end-user would, and yes, it usually takes a long time to do it.</p>
<p>It is usually better to ask the end-user to provide this manual test case instead of doing it yourself because they will most likely do it faster and more accurately.</p>
<p>If your code doesn’t output the same, you have to iterate, find the error, fix it, and test again until it matches the expected output.</p>
<p>If your test ran alright, give the solution to the stakeholders, so they can try it with more test cases and give you feedback if there is something to fix, enhance, or if your solution is just right.</p>
<p>Embrace this process and you will be way more successful than just sitting and coding in dark.</p>
<h2>Finding help</h2>
<p>What to do if you get stuck?</p>
<p>It does not matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you will eventually get stuck.</p>
<p>I’ve been coding for a long time and I still get stuck.</p>
<p>Finding a way out of a problem by yourself is a major ability for a programmer and you should get used to it.</p>
<p>If you see an error, the first thing is to stop and read it carefully.</p>
<p>Sometimes the error is very explicit in telling you what went wrong and what you should do.</p>
<p>See error messages as a friend pointing you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Some errors are not so friendly though.</p>
<p>In this case, Google is your best friend.</p>
<p>Chances are, someone has been through this error before and there is a solution for it on the internet.</p>
<p>Just copy and paste the error message on Google and look for the solutions available.</p>
<p>You might need to open more than a few blogs and forums, but trust me, this is a part of the process, and getting good at it is really important.</p>
<p>I encourage you to spend some time reading the official documentation of anything you are learning in tech.</p>
<p>Some documentations are just bad, but most major technologies have good docs and Python is one of them as you can see here <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/">Python Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Learning from the source is a great advantage in this ever-evolving world of programming.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-4f5abb4a=""> <div><p><strong>"When it comes to data security versus ease of access, it's usually a trade-off. The fact that IPFS doesn't compromise on either is awesome — and it feels great to ditch Amazon S3 buckets for open source."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">#</a> Overview</h2> <p><img src="https://docs.ipfs.io/assets/img/logo-arbol.e1ca2350.svg" alt="Arbol logo" width="220"></p> <p><a href="https://www.arbolmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arbol</a> is a software platform that connects agricultural entities like farmers and other weather-dependent parties with investors and other capital providers to insure and protect against weather-related risks. Arbol's platform sells contracts for parametric weather protection agreements in a marketplace that's an innovative, data-driven approach to risk management, cutting out the usual legacy insurance claims process of making loss assessments on the ground. Instead, Arbol relies on tamper-proof data indexes to determine payouts, and doesn't require a defined loss to be indemnified. Arbol's platform combines parametric weather protection with blockchain-based smart contracts to provide cost-efficient, automated, and user-defined weather-related risk hedging. As with traditional crop insurance and similar legacy products, end users purchase assurance that they'll be financially protected in the case of adverse weather — but with Arbol, these end users are paid automatically if adverse conditions occur, as defined by the contract and measured by local meteorological observations tracked by Arbol's data sources.</p> <p>To build the data indexes that Arbol uses to handle its contracts, the team aggregates and standardizes billions of data files comprising decades of weather information from a wide range of reputable sources — all of which is stored on IPFS. IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model due to the inherent verifiability provided by its <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content-addressed architecture</a>, as well as a decentralized data delivery model that facilitates Arbol's day-to-day aggregation, synchronization, and distribution of massive amounts of data.</p> <p>While United States agribusiness has been Arbol's initial area of focus, the team has built a globally capable platform, with expansion underway to new regions and industries around the world. Arbol currently provides contracts for managing the risks of weather exposure in the energy and agriculture sectors, and features both custom and pre-designed protection agreements for clients across industries and scale. Their current end-user base ranges from small coffee farms to major agribusinesses and power producers.</p> <p>In short, Arbol's platform is a risk marketplace where end users can get competitively priced risk management solutions and capital providers can benefit from access to a lucrative, but underdeveloped, weather risk market. And because Arbol uses IPFS for its data storage and delivery needs, end users and underwriting partners can be certain that the data Arbol uses to determine price and payouts for contracts is tamper-proof and trustworthy.</p> <h3 id="arbol-by-the-numbers"><a href="#arbol-by-the-numbers">#</a> Arbol by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>1T</p> <p>weather-related data points hosted on IPFS</p></div><div><p>1M</p> <p>hashes generated on Arbol data every day</p></div><div><p>40</p> <p>years of high-resolution climate data</p></div><div><p>200GB</p> <p>average Arbol dataset size</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Arbol's story begins with the commodities markets, where Siddhartha Jha, the founder and CEO, worked as a quantitative analyst and portfolio manager. What Jha saw there was a problem without a solution: Massive (and growing) demand for weather risk management for supply chains, farming industries, and the energy sector, but no viable, efficient, or cost-effective weather risk market to meet that demand. Traditional crop insurance was plagued by inefficiencies and high cost ceilings, with insurance providers forced to charge high premiums that only large corporations could afford. And while more efficient parametric insurance solutions were available on the market, even these data-driven options were often saddled with high overhead and bureaucratic waste. As a result, small businesses and local farmers were often trapped without access to protection from weather-related risks.</p> <p>Arbol aims to change that by bringing fundamental transparency, efficiency, and data-driven objectivity to the weather risk market, ensuring that any business of any size can get the appropriate protection they need to manage their level of weather-related risk. The Arbol platform achieves this goal by providing a novel mechanism for weather-exposed businesses to connect with capital providers. The key to Arbol's approach is flexible financial derivatives that leverage the power of big data and machine learning to provide parametric risk protection at low cost. These parametric structures determine automatic payouts based on metrics that are strongly correlated with financial loss.</p> <p>With Arbol, an end user pays to hedge against a specific weather-related event, such as yearly deviation in rainfall amounts or temperature. After deciding on a premium and selecting a payout amount, the end user then relies on Arbol's platform to handle the rest. Because parametric structures are objective and data-driven, they can achieve a level of precision, reliability, and cost effectiveness that traditional insurance cannot. In fact, one of Arbol's key benefits over legacy weather insurance is that it allows for hyper-local protection for managing user-specific levels of risk.</p> <p>Arbol's approach also improves upon standard parametric insurance by combining parametric insurance's precision and flexibility with the security, transparency, and efficiency of blockchain. Many of Arbol's protection agreement contracts are executed as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts automatically deliver payouts to end users as soon as a relevant adverse weather event occurs.</p> <p>Delivering weather risk management solutions through blockchain-based contracts like this eliminates costly payout delays, as well as risks associated with fraud, corruption, and bureaucratic overhead. It also brings the benefits of peer-to-peer decentralization: Arbol users don't need to rely on Arbol as a financial middleman, because funds are locked between end users and capital providers without Arbol controlling the transfer of funds.</p> <p>However, even the best smart contract is only as smart as the data it draws from. The "oracle problem" can be a foundational obstacle for smart contracts — but Arbol's use of IPFS eliminates this risk. Because a smart contract automatically and trustlessly executes based on data, it doesn't matter how secure, transparent, and publicly verifiable its use of blockchain is. Without an accurate, trustworth, and immutable data "oracle", even blockchain-based smart contracts can be easily biased, compromised, or manipulated. For Arbol, that's where IPFS is absolutely critical.</p> <p>IPFS's content-addressed architecture enables Arbol to ensure the integrity and public verifiability of its datasets, something that traditional location addressing using centralized server architecture cannot provide. Smart contracts pointing to specific, immutable IPFS CIDs, rather than to data locations that could be tampered with, can be relied upon thanks to the integrity of their oracle.</p> <div><p><strong>"IPFS is very much at the heart of everything we do at Arbol. IPFS serves as our independently verifiable data store for all of the weather data associated with the contracts we sell. It imbues our platform with the essential principles of decentralization, data security, and public verifiability."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <p>Arbol builds its data indexes by drawing on large weather-related datasets from a variety of trusted public and private sources, including prominent U.S. government institutions such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These sources track weather data including yearly rainfall amounts, temperature fluctuations, wind speeds, and more. However, while much of the data Arbol uses is publicly available, it isn't always easily usable; much of the data, particularly deeper historical records, is stored in outdated formats, and very little of it is organized into an easily readable structure. Arbol's data indexes process, correlate, and package this data so that it is readily available for use in the weather risk market. And by putting that data onto IPFS, Arbol also ensures that it has a verifiable, tamper-resistant, and decentralized home.</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Arbol's business model hinges upon the benefits afforded by IPFS — without its immutable content addressing and inherent data verifiability, the benefits Arbol provides would be impossible to achieve in a cost-effective and efficient way. As a whole, IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model by providing the following:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Immutable addressing:</strong> Because all data stored using IPFS is referenced and accessed via unique <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content identifiers (CIDs)</a>, any change to a data item means it receives a new CID exclusive to that revision. It's impossible to change data without changing its CID.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data verifiability:</strong> Contracts on Arbol's platform are linked to specific, verifiably unchanged, content-addressed data. Because parametric weather risk management absolutely relies on user agreement about and trust in source data, Arbol's approach offers reassurance unavailable with other offerings in the market.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Decentralized data delivery:</strong> Arbol works with massive datasets comprising billions of files and terabytes of information. IPFS accommodates Arbol's methodology for publishing and adding to large datasets while still enabling Arbol to release and synchronize these datasets via a decentralized storage network.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="how-arbol-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-arbol-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Arbol uses IPFS</h2> <p>Arbol's end users enjoy the "it just works" benefits of parametric protection, but a lot goes on behind the scenes to enable this data-driven solution. Arbol's weather datasets range from 1GB to 1TB in size, and each one goes through a detailed ingestion process before it can be used. Once it has been decided that a dataset meets Arbol's criteria for usefulness and validity, it is time to add it to Arbol's IPFS pipeline, a multi-stage process outlined below.</p> <ol><li><p><strong>Query/release:</strong> If a …</p></li></ol></div></div>

When fat tails dominate returns it's not worth having an extremely high bar if it might cause you to miss out on one of these future juggernauts.</p><p>VCs often talk about power laws, but few have sufficient data to rigorously demonstrate them. However, <a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> does, and their head data scientist, Abe Othman, has <a href="https://angel.co/blog/venture-returns">done the work</a> to analyze returns from the thousands of deals syndicated by AngelList, finding that:</p><blockquote>... <strong>the regret an investor could have for missing a winning seed-stage investment is theoretically infinite</strong>, a phenomenon that does not appear to hold for later-stage investments. The implication is that <strong>investors increase their expected return by indexing as broadly as possible at the seed stage</strong> (i.e., by putting money into every credible deal), because <strong>any selective policy for seed-stage investing—absent perfect foresight—will eventually be outperformed by an indexing approach</strong>.</blockquote><p>By creating power law-based mathematical model, fitting it to the AngelList returns data, and simulating 50,000 portfolios with 10 early-stage companies each, he created the following synthetic distribution of venture capital returns:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/07/chart_2.png" alt="Distribution of hypothetical manager returns showing the market return outperforms"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://angel.co/blog/what-angellist-data-says-about-power-law-returns-in-venture-capital">AngelList</a></figcaption></figure><p>The vertical black line represents the <em>market return</em>: the return you'd earn if you invested an equal amount in every AngelList deal in the sample (of which there were 1,808). Notice the long tail trailing off to the right side of the chart. In a world where most barely return their fund, some shower their LPs with 5x returns. <strong>Notice how most 10-company portfolios underperform the simple (1,808-company) strategy.</strong></p><p>Technically, this is still a theoretical result. Yes, the model was fit to real data, but the outputs are still simulated. Now let's look at real data.</p><p>Here again we turn to AngelList, who analyze the relationship between portfolio size and performance among 10,000+ investors on the platform. They grouped the investors by number of companies in their portfolio and plotted the median return for each group. The chart confirms the theoretical results - larger portfolios generate greater returns:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/07/H5qNMNZPFO.png" alt="img"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://angel.co/pdf/lp-performance.pdf">AngelList</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>The coefficient of the regression term is 9.0 <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp">basis points</a>... implying that <strong>the typical annual return of a portfolio of 100 investments is almost 9% higher than the typical annual return of a portfolio with a single investment</strong>.</blockquote><p>Note these are median returns, so they don't reflect a handful of 100-count portfolios simply getting lucky and pulling up the average. <strong>Financial upside is easier to come by when you're exposed to a larger patch of the startup landscape.</strong></p><p>Theory and data agree - most early-stage venture investors would do better by indexing, investing a small amount in every reasonable startup they can find:</p><blockquote>Simulations on 10-year investing windows for seed-stage deals suggest <strong>fewer than 10% of investors will beat the index</strong>, even if those investors have skill in picking deals. Like Vanguard has taught us in the public markets, <strong>individual investors could benefit from viewing the index as the default</strong> and then overlaying individual deals that they like.</blockquote><h2 id="1-n">1/N</h2><p>Behavioral finance theorists have a name for this strategy: <a href="https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/07/08/heuristics-and-robustness-in-asset-allocation/">the 1/N heuristic</a>.</p><p>It goes like this: take every investable asset of a group of N assets and invest 1/Nth of your capital in each one, with no regard to the fundamentals, mean return, or volatility of returns.</p><p>This might sound like a dumb, simplistic strategy. While it's certainly simple, it's definitely not dumb.</p><p>Ironically, 1990 Nobel Laureate and famed inventor of mean-variance portfolio optimization, Harry Markowitz, reportedly used this exact heuristic for investing his own money, eschewing his own complicated theory in favor of a simpler approach:</p><blockquote>I should have computed the historical covariance of the asset classes and drawn an efficient frontier…I split my contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities. - <a href="https://alphaarchitect.com/2014/10/17/harry-markowitz-an-equal-weight-investor/">Harry Markowitz</a></blockquote><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/07/image-20200624134947087.png" alt="image-20200624134947087"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gRdOBrus_9wC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=your+money+and+your+brain+harry+markowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awRnIfiMs4&amp;sig=sY4wPziYOjm9oB5f3MN_z7gloMw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bEM3VKT9MIjIsATj_4Fw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Your Money and Your Brain</a></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, <a href="http://faculty.london.edu/avmiguel/DeMiguel-Garlappi-Uppal-RFS.pdf">one study</a> found that the 1/N strategy dominates numerous others:</p><blockquote>Of the 14 models we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, <strong>none is consistently better than the 1/N rule</strong> in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover, which indicates that, out of sample, <strong>the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error</strong>... &nbsp;That is, the effect of estimation error is so large that <strong>it erodes completely the gains from optimal diversification</strong>.</blockquote><p>Which is a fancy way of saying "<em>don't overcomplicate it.</em>"</p><p>A <em>slightly</em> more sophisticated reading of the results might be, "<em>unless you are <strong>very</strong> sure about the structure of the world, don't overcomplicate your investing strategy.</em>"</p><p>The study found a negative return to overthinking and overfitting yourself to the past data, to what you <em>think</em> you know about these assets. In venture, similar overintellectualization has been the root cause of numerous "misses" over the years - career, fund, and firm-defining deals that put certain VCs on the map and left others in desperate obscurity.</p><p>In some <em>subtle</em> way, trying to pick the exact right startup based on a complex model of the world is like trying to buy a certain lottery ticket with a certain serial number because you think it's a "lucky ticket." One <em>seems</em> much more superstitious, but are they closer than they appear?</p><h2 id="how-the-other-half-lives">How the other half lives</h2><p>Late stage investors on the other hand, <em>can</em> afford to stock pick:</p><blockquote>... our results also suggest that the opportunity cost for missing a winning investment in these later rounds is bounded... Consequently, <strong>it is entirely appropriate that later-stage investors should reject the “spray and pray” idea and be thoughtful and discerning when they participate</strong>...</blockquote><p>Translation: late-stage deals have lower opportunity cost than early-stage investments, as their returns are capped much lower. To channel Jeff Bezos' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">regret minimization framework</a>: there isn't much regret to minimize when it comes to late-stage deals. So feel free to be picky.</p><p>Another take from the 1/N study:</p><blockquote>... we conclude that portfolio strategies from the optimizing models are expected to outperform the 1/N benchmark if: <strong>(i) the estimation window is long</strong>; (ii) the ex ante (true) Sharpe ratio of the mean-variance efficient portfolio is substantially higher than that of the 1/N portfolio; and <strong>(iii) the number of assets is small</strong>.</blockquote><p>In other words, it makes sense to be picky and particular when you have a large amount of data collected over a long period of time and when the number of choices is small. Both are more true of later-stage investments relative to early-stage. By definition, late-stage companies have a longer track record by which to evaluate them, and there are fewer of them. Thus, it makes sense to be a discerning capital allocator at the late-stage.</p><p>And yet we've seen the exact <em>opposite</em> in recent years.</p><p>Though few would publicly characterize themselves as such, I know of at least a few firms who have explicit goals of creating, effectively, "indices of late-stage venture" via their large portfolios. Late-stage funds are raising and deploying capital at unprecedented rates. Many appear principally focused on putting "dollars to work," rather than earning the maximum return on their capital. They've taken to heart the approach discussed earlier, investing in every company that meets some minimum threshold.</p><p>This has led to serious perversion at the late-stage, as there are not nearly enough investable assets to support the capital inflows at reasonable valuations. <strong>Asset values grow not simply due to improvement in fundamental startup value but also because late-stage funds need somewhere to park their money</strong>.</p><p>In this model, late-stage startups become "<em>capital vehicles</em>," absorbing meaningful capital and earning a "<em>capital storage</em>" premium for their efforts.</p><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/party-rounds">Party rounds</a>, long known to greatly <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2010/09/party-rounds-how-to-get-high-valuation.html">inflate early-stage valuations</a>, have reached the late-stage.</p><p>But all parties must come to end eventually...</p><h2 id="caveat-emptor-indexor"><em>Caveat <s>emptor</s> indexor</em></h2><p>So that's the theory, but there are some real practical hurdles to creating an early-stage index:</p><ul><li>Determining the right minimum threshold</li><li>No one sees every deal</li><li>Deals must be won</li><li>Fund and check size restrictions</li></ul><h3 id="how-high-should-the-bar-be">How high should the bar be?</h3><p>AngelList recommends investing in every <em>credible</em> early-stage deal, where the word "credible" does a lot of work.

September 11, 2020 | https://www.ayrshare.com/our-firebase-tech-stack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ayrshare.com/our-firebase-tech-stack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="5f340663d99e7">

<p>When we started <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/">Ayrshare</a> we were keen on using an infrastructure as a service platform and avoid server setup, SSL certs, opening ports, etc. Time to market, right. Amongst the many platforms out there we choose <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>. It was an easy decision for us since we are very comfortable with Firebase having built, and even sold, apps built upon it. If not Firebase our second choice would have been <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p>







<h2>Today and Tomorrow Requirements</h2>



<p>The first question we asked was, “What we need today?” If came down to a few criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Authentication, ideally having SSO with the major networks</li><li>Hosting a static single page app (React)</li><li>Hosting a landing page. We generally don’t like to build the landing pages in React.</li><li>A database, preferably noSQL</li><li>Back-end running NodeJS, preferably serverless</li><li>Event tracking, e.g. Google Analytics</li><li>Email service</li><li>Payment service</li></ul>



<p>Second, we asked, “What we might need tomorrow?”</p>



<ul><li>iOS and Android apps</li><li>Mobile app push notifications</li><li>ML (machine learning)</li></ul>







<h2>Our Stack</h2>



<p>We have built on many platform: AWS, Heroku, under our desk (not kidding), and Digital Ocean. We ended up choosing Firebase since it meets a lot of our needs, but certainly not all.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="667" src="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-1024x667.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-1024x667.png 1024w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-768x500.png 768w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1.png 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-1024x667.png" data-srcset="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-1024x667.png 1024w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1-768x500.png 768w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stack3-1.png 1130w"></figure>







<p>Firebase is a good choice for SPA React hosting and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Firestore</a> as a noSQL database. Google Analytics comes built into Firebase. Also, using Firebase’s <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui">authentication UI</a> system allowed us to have a secure registration and login process integrated with major SSO providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub.</p>



<p>The landing page we built in WordPress hosted on Siteground. There are so many great templates and plugins available for WordPress that we see no reason to recreate the wheel in React. Another option we considered was <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> hosted on separate Firebase project.</p>



<p>Sending emails requires a mail provider and we are accustomed to using Mailgun. Firebase has recently introduced <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions">Extensions</a>, prebuilt cloud functions. One of our favorite is the <a href="https://www.anothermadworld.com/emailing-with-firebase-trigger-email-extension/">Email Trigger extension</a> that facilitates sending email from your cloud functions.</p>



<p>For a payment system, we choose Stripe. Stripe has a really nice <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe">NPM package</a> that makes integration relatively easy.</p>



<p>Finally, we decided right before launch to add a <a href="https://docs.ayrshare.com/rest-api/endpoints/shorten">link shortener,</a> which is very useful when publishing to networks like Twitter that limit the characters. At first we were going to go with bit.ly, but it would soon become more expensive than what we were charging users. We ultimately went with Firebase’s <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/dynamic-links">Dynamic Links</a>, Google’s replacement for goo.gl. Dynamic Links real power are with mobile apps, but it can also be used as a link shortener if you are willing use the RESTful API calls.</p>







<h3>Firebase Cloud Functions &amp; APIs</h3>



<p>Ayrshare is build as an API first platform, so it is critical to have a robust API system. Building a Cloud Function for each API endpoint is not flexible or secure. However, you can add <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> to Cloud Function and it is an excellent and battle tested framework to build and expose APIs.</p>



<p>For example, you can add several security and API facilitating packages such as:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const helmet = require("helmet");
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");</code></pre>







<p>If you do add Express, you can add the “app” as an http function and export it.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">const app = express();
exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app);</code></pre>







<p>And then add you typical express functions.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">app.get("/fun", (req, res) =&gt; {
  console.log("hello fun");
  return res.send('"Hi fun");
});</code></pre>











<h3>Looking Towards the Future</h3>



<p>In the future we plan on building mobile apps, especially for allowing Instagram posting, and will require push notifications. In previous projects we used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Firebase’s Cloud Messaging</a> (FCM) system and found it easy, reliable, and free!</p>



<p>And if we really look ahead, we want to add some ML analysis on ideal posting times. The current Firebase ML offering doesn’t seem a great fit, but perhaps it will be in the future.</p>

September 11, 2020 | https://jeko.frama.io/en/booleans.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeko.frama.io/en/booleans.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
                    
<p>The two boolean values are: "true" and "false". Respectively <code>#t</code> or <code>#true</code> and <code>#f</code> or <code>#false</code> in Guile.</p>
<p>In a conditional test context, "true" means any expression other than <code>#f</code> (or <code>#false</code>).</p>
<p>I invite you to create a new directory in the workspace dedicated to this chapter: <code>~/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans</code>.</p>
<h2>Write the test first</h2>
<p>Create the file <code>booleans-test.scm</code>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>(use-modules (srfi srfi-64)
             (booleans))

(test-begin "harness")

(test-equal "true-inverted-returns-false"
  #f
  (boolean-invert #t))
  
(test-end "harness")
</code></pre>
<h2>Try and run the test</h2>
<pre><code>guile -L . booleans-test.scm
</code></pre>
<p>Compilation error !</p>
<pre><code>;;; note: auto-compilation is enabled, set GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE=0
;;;       or pass the --no-auto-compile argument to disable.
;;; compiling /home/jeko/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans/booleans-test.scm
;;; WARNING: compilation of /home/jeko/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans/booleans-test.scm failed:
;;; no code for module (booleans)
</code></pre>
<h2>Write the minimal amount of code for the test to run and check the failing test output</h2>
<p>Compilation errors can be seen as red tests. In the tradition of TDD, it is essential to add only the bare minimum of code to correct these errors.</p>
<p>Here, the compiler indicates that the <code>booleans</code> module does not exist. I create it to correct this error and immediately restart the test.</p>
<p>Create the file <code>booleans.scm</code>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>(define-module (booleans))
</code></pre>
<p>A new error occurs! This time it compiles, but I'm warned that the <code>boolean-invert</code> variable is not linked (i.e. it is not defined). I add it to my previously created module and re-run the test.</p>
<p>Edit the file <code>booleans.scm</code>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>(define-module (booleans))

(define-public (boolean-invert bool)
  0)
</code></pre>
<p>No more errors or warnings at compile time. The test fails and you can check the reason for the failure in the <code>harness.log</code> report. A quick look confirms that the reason for the failure is that the <code>true-inverted-returns-false</code> test waits for the value <code>#f</code> while the <code>boolean-invert</code> procedure always returns <code>0</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat harness.log 
%%%% Starting test harness
Group begin: harness
Test begin:
  test-name: "true-inverted-returns-false"
  source-file: "booleans-test.scm"
  source-line: 6
  source-form: (test-equal "true-inverted-returns-false" #f (boolean-invert #t))
Test end:
  result-kind: fail
  actual-value: 0
  expected-value: #f
Group end: harness
# of unexpected failures  1
</code></pre>
<h2>Write enough code to make it pass</h2>
<p>I modify the <code>boolean-invert</code> procedure so that it returns the value <code>#f</code> as expected by the test.</p>
<p>Edit the file <code>booleans.scm</code>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>(define-module (booleans))

(define-public (boolean-invert bool)
  #f)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the test displays the following message :</p>
<pre><code>$ guile -L . booleans-test.scm
;;; note: source file /home/jeko/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans/booleans-test.scm
;;;       newer than compiled /home/jeko/.cache/guile/ccache/3.0-LE-8-4.3/home/jeko/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans/booleans-test.scm.go
;;; note: auto-compilation is enabled, set GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE=0
;;;       or pass the --no-auto-compile argument to disable.
;;; compiling /home/jeko/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans/booleans-test.scm
;;; compiled /home/jeko/.cache/guile/ccache/3.0-LE-8-4.3/home/jeko/Workspace/guile-handbook/booleans/booleans-test.scm.go
%%%% Starting test harness  (Writing full log to "harness.log")
# of expected passes      1
</code></pre>
<p>The test passes !</p>
<h2>Refactor</h2>
<p>There's not much to do for so little code.</p>
<h3>Docstrings</h3>
<p>I take this opportunity to tell you about <strong>docstrings</strong>. These strings bring a little explanation to the user if needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the REPL, with the command <code>,describe</code>.</li>
<li>in Emacs</li>
</ul>
<p>These are strings placed in second position in the parameter list when defining a variable or a procedure with <code>define</code>, <code>define*</code> or <code>define-public</code> (and so on).</p>
<p>Let's add a <strong>docstring</strong> to the <code>boolean-invert</code> procedure!</p>
<p>Edit the file <code>booleans.scm</code>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>(define-module (booleans))

(define-public (boolean-invert bool)
  "Returns the opposite value of the given boolean."
  #f)
</code></pre>
<h2>Write the test first</h2>
<p>The first test verified that calling the <code>boolean-invert</code> procedure with the <code>#t</code> parameter returns <code>#f</code>. The next test will check the reverse.</p>
<p>Edit the file <code>booleans-test.scm</code>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>(use-modules (srfi srfi-64)
             (booleans))

(test-begin "harness")

(test-equal "true-inverted-returns-false"
  #f
  (boolean-invert #t))
 
(test-equal "false-inverted-returns-true"
  #t
  (boolean-invert #f))
  
(test-end "harness")
</code></pre>
<h2>Try and run the test</h2>
<pre><code>$ guile -L . booleans-test.scm 
</code></pre>
<p>It compiles without any problem!</p>
<h2>Write the minimal amount of code for the test to run and check the failing test output</h2>
<p>You can see the new test failling.</p>
<pre><code>booleans-test.scm:10: FAIL false-inverted-returns-true
</code></pre>
<p>Check that the reason for the failure is the expect one. That is, the <code>false-inverted-returns-true</code> test waits for the value <code>#t</code> but gets <code>#f</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Test begin:
  test-name: "false-inverted-returns-true"
  source-file: "booleans-test.scm"
  source-line: 10
  source-form: (test-equal "false-inverted-returns-true" #t (boolean-invert #f))
Test end:
  result-kind: fail
  actual-value: #f
  expected-value: #t
</code></pre>
<p>This is confirmed.</p>
<h2>Write enough code to make it pass</h2>
<p>Let's add the minimum amount of code required to pass the test:</p>
<pre><code>(define-module (booleans))

(define-public (boolean-invert bool)
  "Returns the opposite value of the given boolean."
  (if bool
      #f
      #t))
</code></pre>
<p>Run the tests again…</p>
<pre><code>%%%% Starting test harness  (Writing full log to "harness.log")
# of expected passes      2
</code></pre>
<p>All clear !</p>
<h2>Refactor</h2>
<p>As you might have guessed, there is a ready-made procedure for inverting a boolean :</p>
<pre><code>(define-module (booleans))

(define-public (boolean-invert bool)
  "Returns the opposite value of the given boolean."
  (not bool))
</code></pre>
<p>I restart the tests one last time to check that this re-machining hasn't broken anything:</p>
<pre><code>%%%% Starting test harness  (Writing full log to "harness.log")
# of expected passes      2
</code></pre>
<p>Done.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>What has been covered in this chapter :</p>
<ul>
<li>More TDD practice</li>
<li>Notions about booleans</li>
<li>Write self-documented code thanks to docstrings</li>
</ul>

September 11, 2020 | https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2020/01/20/extracting-sql-code-from-ssis-dtsx-packages-with-python-lxml/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2020/01/20/extracting-sql-code-from-ssis-dtsx-packages-with-python-lxml/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lately, I’ve been refactoring a sprawling SSIS <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services?view=sql-server-ver15">(SQL Server Integration Services)</a> package that ineffectually wrestles with large XML files. In this programmer’s opinion using SSIS for heavy-duty XML parsing is geeky self-abuse so I’ve opted to replace an eye-ball straining<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> SSIS package with half a dozen, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/">“as simple as possible but no simpler”</a>, Python scripts. If the Python is fast enough for production great! If not the scripts will serve as a clear model<a id="fnref2" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> for something faster.</p>



<p>I’m only refactoring<a id="fnref3" href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> part of a larger <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/ETL.html">ETL</a> process so whatever I do <em>it must mesh with the rest of the mess.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>So where is the rest of the SSIS mess?</em></strong></p>



<p>SSIS’s visual editor does a wonderful job of hiding the damn code!</p>



<p><strong><em>This is a problem!</em></strong></p>



<p>If only there was a simple way to troll through large sprawling SSIS <em>spider-webby</em> packages and extract <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPiHQ37gXnE">the good bits</a>. Fortunately, Python’s XML parsing tools can be easily applied to SSIS dtsx files. <em>SSIS dtsx files are XML files.</em> The following code snippets illustrate how to hack these files.</p>



<p>First import the required Python modules. lxml is not always included in Python distributions. Use the <a href="https://remotedevdaily.com/how-to-install-lxml-in-python-using-pip/">pip</a> or <a href="https://anaconda.org/anaconda/lxml">conda</a> tools to install this module.</p>


<pre title=""># imports
import os
from lxml import etree
</pre>


<p>Set an output directory. I’m running on a Windows machine. If you’re on a Mac or Linux machine adjust the path.</p>


<pre title=""># set sql output directory
sql_out = r"C:\temp\dtsxsql"
if not os.path.isdir(sql_out):
    os.makedirs(sql_out)
</pre>


<p>Point to the dtsx package you want to extract code from.</p>


<pre title=""># dtsx files
dtsx_path = r'C:\Users\john\AnacondaProjects\testfolder\bixml'
ssis_dtsx = dtsx_path + r'\ParseXML.dtsx'
</pre>


<p>Read and parse the SSIS package.</p>


<pre title="">tree = etree.parse(ssis_dtsx)
root = tree.getroot()
root.tag
</pre>


<p>lxml&nbsp;renders XML namespace tags like:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;DTS:Executable&nbsp;as&nbsp;{www.microsoft.com/SqlServer/Dts}Executable.</p>



<p>The following shows all the transformed element tags in the&nbsp;dtsx&nbsp;package.</p>


<pre title=""># collect unique element tags in dtsx
ele_set = set()
for ele in root.xpath(".//*"):
    ele_set.add(ele.tag)    
print(ele_set)
print(len(ele_set))
</pre>


<p>Using transformed element tags of interest blast over the&nbsp;dtsx&nbsp;and suck out the bits of interest.</p>


<pre title="">pfx = '{www.microsoft.com/'
exe_tag = pfx + 'SqlServer/Dts}Executable'
obj_tag = pfx + 'SqlServer/Dts}ObjectName'
dat_tag = pfx + 'SqlServer/Dts}ObjectData'
tsk_tag = pfx + 'sqlserver/dts/tasks/sqltask}SqlTaskData'
src_tag = pfx + \
  'sqlserver/dts/tasks/sqltask}SqlStatementSource'

# extract sql source statements and write to *.sql files 
total_bytes = 0
package_name = root.attrib[obj_tag].replace(" ","")
for cnt, ele in enumerate(root.xpath(".//*")):
  if ele.tag == exe_tag:
    attr = ele.attrib
    for child0 in ele:
      if child0.tag == dat_tag:
        for child1 in child0:
          sql_comment = attr[obj_tag].strip()
          if child1.tag == tsk_tag:
            dtsx_sql = child1.attrib[src_tag]
            dtsx_sql = "-- " + \
                sql_comment + "\n" + dtsx_sql
            sql_file = sql_out + "\\" \
                 + package_name + str(cnt) + ".sql"
            total_bytes += len(dtsx_sql)
            print((len(dtsx_sql), 
                 sql_comment, sql_file))
            with open(sql_file, "w") as file:
              file.write(dtsx_sql)
print(('total bytes',total_bytes))

<p><span>Written: 11 Sep 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><p>If you’re in western USA (like us) at the moment, you might be finding it hard to breath. Breathing air that contains the fallout from fires can make you feel pretty awful, and it can be bad for long-term health as well. Wildfire smoke contains <a href="http://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/Documents/Guidelines%20and%20Forms/Guidelines%20and%20Manuals/Health-Environment/BCCDC_WildFire_FactSheet_CompositionOfSmoke.pdf">fine particulate matter</a>, known as “PM2.5”, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs. The “2.5” here refers to the size of the particles — they are 2.5 microns or smaller. To see the air quality in your area, check out this <a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/">AirNow map</a>. Once it’s orange, you might find you start feeling the effects. If it’s red or purple, you almost certainly will. (Sometimes it can appear smokey outside, but the air quality can be OK, because the smoke might be higher in the atmosphere.)</p>
<p>The good news is that there’s a lot you can do to make the air you breathe a lot better. You might be wondering why a data scientist like me is commenting on air filtration… The reason is that I was <a href="http://archive.is/evklI">a leader</a> of the Masks4All movement, including writing the first and most comprehensive <a href="http://preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/">scientific paper</a> on the topic, which meant I studied filtration very closely for months. In fact, the size of particles we want to block for wildfires is very similar to the size of particles we want to block for covid-19!</p>

<p>The three ways that you can breathe cleaner air are to use a mask, filter your home central airconditioner or heater, and use fans with filters. I’ll show you the details below. (There’s quite a few links to places you can buy products in this post; I don’t get any commission or anything from them, they’re just things that I’ve personally found helpful.)</p>
<h2 id="masks">Masks</h2>
<p>Therefore, you won’t be surprised to learn that one of the most effective things that you can do is to wear a mask. To block most PM2.5 particles you’ll want a mask that’s well-fitted and uses a good filter material. I’ve already prepared advice on that topic for COVID-19, and pretty much all of it is exactly the same for wildfire PM2.5, so go <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/07/10/upgrade-your-mask/">read this now</a>. One bit that’s less of an issue is the “Sanitation” section — wildfire PM2.5 particles aren’t bearing disease, so you only have to worry about sanitation if your mask is actually getting dirty (or if you’ve been out in public with it on).</p>
<p>Personally, I like the <a href="https://o2nanomask.com/">O2 nano mask</a>, or any well-fitted mask that you can insert a <a href="https://filti.com/">Filti</a> filter in to. Recent aerosol science tests show that a neck gaiter folded to create two layers works well too (but make sure you add a nose clip to remove gaps around your nose). Check out Etsy for lots of mask designs that include a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?explicit=1&amp;q=mask+with+filter+pocket+and+nose+wire&amp;ref=guided_search_7&amp;guided_search=1">filter pocket and nose clip</a>.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-your-home-air">Filtering your home air</h2>
<p>To clean the air in your home, the basic idea is to have it getting continually pushed through a filter. A filter is simply a piece of material which air can get through, but PM2.5 particles can’t. No filter is perfect, but there are readily-available options which work very well. Filters have a <a href="https://www.coolray.com/img/uploads/What_does_MERV_Rating_mean.pdf">MERV rating</a>, which tells you how many small particles they remove. For wildfire, you generally want MERV 13.</p>
<p>Don’t just buy the highest rating filter you can find. Filters with higher ratings have smaller holes (generally speaking), which means they also don’t let air through as fast. Remember, we want your home air going through the filter quickly, to ensure all your air is getting cleaned, so we don’t want the filter to negatively impact air-flow too much. I recommend <a href="https://www.filtrete.com/3M/en_US/filtrete/products/?N=4315+3292675507+3294529207&amp;rt=rud">Filtrete™ Healthy Living Air Filters</a>. These have good air flow even for the MERV 13 spec.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-filter-to-your-central-air">Adding a filter to your central air</h3>
<p>If you’ve got central heating or air conditioning, then you’re in luck. That will have strong fans, covering all of your rooms. The trick is to filter the air coming <em>in</em> to the system. Nearly all home systems simply pull their air in through a large vent inside your home. Some units have a filter slot in the unit itself, whereas for some the input vent is in a totally separate location in the house. Note that air conditioners blow air <em>out</em> to outside the house, but they don’t suck air <em>in</em> from outside the house (except, generally, for more fancy commercial building HVAC systems).</p>
<p>Once you’ve found the inlet vent that your central air is pulling in from, add a filter to it. If there’s already one there, make sure it’s MERV 13 or 14. You should change it every 3 months or so (depending on the brand). A vent with a filter installed looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img width="600" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/vent.jpg" alt="An inlet vent, showing filter underneath">
<figcaption>An inlet vent, showing filter underneath</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: Most filters have an arrow on the side showing the direction of airflow. So make sure you put it the right way around! Also, make sure you buy the right size. Measure the size of your vent, and buy a filter that is <em>at least</em> big enough to cover the hole. If there are gaps, the air will go through them, instead of your filter!</p>
<p>If there’s not a obvious place to add a filter to your vent, you’ll need to get creative. It might not look pretty, but you could always just remove the vent cover and fasten the filter straight over the top, using tape, poster tack, etc.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your filter in place, the most important thing is to set your central air settings such that it has the <strong>fan running all the time</strong>. Most systems have an “auto” setting , which only turns the fan on when heating or cooling. You don’t want that! Set the fan to “on”, not to “auto”. That way, you’re getting as much air through that filter as possible.</p>
<h3 id="adding-filters-to-fans-and-portable-ac">Adding filters to fans and portable A/C</h3>
<p>I recommend having an air purifier in every room. Most air purifiers don’t really do that much, because they’re normally quiet and small (which means they don’t move much air). There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filtrete-Purifier-Filter-4-speed-FAP-T03BA-G2/dp/B083ZZ96RV">extra large purifiers</a> for sale, but they’re very expensive, and often sold out at the moment.</p>
<p>But we can create our own air purifier that works as well or better than the big expensive ones. An air purifier is simply a fan blowing air through a filter. So if we use a big fan and a good filter, then we have a good air purifier! The trick is to buy a 20 inch “box fan” (which is just a fan in a 20 inch square box), and stick a 20 inch filter in front of it. We pick 20 inches because that’s pretty big, and a bigger fan and bigger filter means more filtration can happen in a given time.</p>
<p>I bought a few of these box fans: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087C2LJ25/">PELONIS 3-Speed Box Fan</a>. I’m not saying this one is any better or worse than any other — just buy whatever you can get your hands on. You want one that has a high speed setting, to push lots of air through.</p>
<p>For filters, anything of the right size and MERV 13 or 14 spec should be fine. I bought this pack of 6 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filtrete-EA02-6PK-1E-Filter-White-Pack/dp/B07FNWB1FD/">20 inch Filtrete filters</a>. Generally, higher quality filters will allow better air flow. Also thicker filters can increase airflow too; e.g. instead of the 20x20x1 filters I got, you could try <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=20x20x4+air+filter+merv+13&amp;crid=1XHHCWT0X2BO3&amp;sprefix=20x20x4+air+filter+13%2Caps%2C246&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_21">20x20x4 (4 inch thick) filters</a>.</p>
<p>The fans I bought have the on/off/speed switch on the front, so I first turned that to the maximum speed setting, since once I attached the filter I couldn’t access the switch any more. Then I stuck some of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H5B9RZY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this adhesive foam</a> all the way around the front face of the fan, trying to leave no gaps. The idea is that when I then stick the fan on top of this, there will be as few gaps as possible. It would probably work just as well to stick a long piece of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duck-Reusable-Removable-Mounting-1436912/dp/B000BQMFEC/">poster tack</a> all around the front face. Finally, I stuck the filter to the front of the fan by using a generous quantity of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J07BRQ/">high quality packing tape</a>.</p>

<p>These things are pretty noisy! But it’s a lot better than having a smoky house. They’re also pretty good for helping keep COVID-19 at bay, so if you have a shop or business, sprinkle a few of these around the place if you don’t have good filtered HVAC with a high change rate.</p>
<p>Another approach I’ve found useful is to buy a compact portable air conditioner. These come with a hose that blows hot air out through your window, and sucks air in through the front or back of the unit. You can stick a filter in front of where it sucks air in, using a similar approach to the fan discussed above.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599786975168/LY_-tbtvH.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I recently wrote a blog post about how I use NVM to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.coreyodonnell.tech/managing-my-node-versions">manage my node version</a>. Someone commented on the post saying I should look into <a target="_blank" href="https://volta.sh/">Volta</a></p>
<h2 id="what-is-volta">What is Volta</h2>
<p>Volta is a command line tool used to manage your Node.js. It is built using Rust and is shipped as a static binary that can be run on Windows and all *nix shells. The goal is to make sure every developer working on the project seamlessly has the same tools and versions installed.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>The installation is simple.</p>
<pre><code>
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
</code></pre>
<p>The script installs the binary in <code>~/.volta</code> and adds <code>~/.volta/bin</code> to your systems path inside of your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, and <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> VOLTA_HOME=<span>"<span>$HOME</span>/.volta"</span>
<span>export</span> PATH=<span>"<span>$VOLTA_HOME</span>/bin:<span>$PATH</span>"</span>
</code></pre><p>Now you can start using Volta to manage Node.js.</p>
<h3 id="using-volta">Using Volta</h3>
<p>You can easily install node using</p>
<pre><code>
volta install node

volta install node@12
</code></pre>
<p>Now node should be available to use whenever you open your terminal.</p>
<p>If you want to set Volta to always load a specific version of node for your active package you can use <code>pin</code>.</p>
<pre><code>volta pin node@12.18.3
</code></pre>
<p>This command will store your pinned version in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>"volta"</span>: {
  "<span>node</span>": <span>"12.18.3"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Every time you navigate to your project, Volta will automatically set your active node version to whatever is pinned.</p>
<p>You can even install and pin global packages like yarn using Volta to make sure everyone on your team is using the same version for their global packages.</p>
<pre><code>volta install yarn
volta pin yarn
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-does-volta-compare-to-nvm">How does Volta compare to NVM?</h2>
<p>NVM is just a node version manager. It only handles installing different versions of node. You can also set a default version of node to load whenever you open your terminal. Volta handles node versions and can set a default version to load also.</p>
<p>When opening a terminal, NVM usually takes about 0.5 to 2 seconds to source in bash if you have a default node version set. Volta does not seem to add any load time.</p>
<p>You can pin node version for your projects using both tools. NVM uses a <code>.nvmrc</code> file and Volta adds a key to your <code>package.json</code>. Volta can also pin versions for global NPM packages used for the project.</p>
<p>NVM does not automatically switch your active node version to your pinned version. You have to run <code>nvm use</code> or install another package call <code>AVN</code>. AVN usually takes 2 to 5 seconds to switch node versions. Volta does it automatically and usually takes less than a second.</p>

<p>Even though I have been using NVM for almost 4 years, I think Volta takes the crown. I plan to use Volta for managing all my Node.js needs from now on. The speed and simplicity of the tool just makes it the better choice. NVM, I am thankful you for all the headaches you have saved me in the past but I think it is time to move on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div id="theme-content-section"><div><section data-css="tve-u-16ec5d248bb"><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Statistical-Significance.jpg" alt="A Primer on Statistical Significance" width="800" height="480" title="Statistical Significance"></figure><p><strong>Statistical significance</strong>, in a nutshell, is a way of determining the degree of unlikely-ness of an experimental result — when a certain status quo hypothesis is assumed to be true.<span id="more-9087"></span></p><p>For example, let’s say that a school had two teachers, each with approximately $30$ students in their class. Both classes take a standardized test, and it turns out that the average score in class A was $5\%$ better than the average in class B.&nbsp; Statistical significance — in this regard — would be our way of determining whether the better score in class A could be attributed to <em>random chance</em>, for instance:</p><ul><li>It was a lucky day for class A.</li><li>Class A just randomly got assigned better prepared students.</li></ul><p>Or whether there is some other factor responsible for the difference in grades between the classes,&nbsp;for instance:</p><ul><li>Teacher A did a better job of teaching than teacher B.</li><li>Teacher A cheated a bit and gave the students some answers ahead of time.</li><li>The classes were purposely split up (e.g., more advanced students or native speakers of a language were put into class A).</li></ul><p>Note that in this case, we wouldn’t — using <em>only</em> the information on the scores at least — attempt to decide what the exact reason for the different scores was. Instead, we would just determine if the score difference could be attributed to pure chance, or that it is so unlikely that there might be some other factors involved.</p><h2 id="start"><span id="Getting_Started"></span><a href="#toc">Getting Started</a><span></span></h2><p>There are two important things when calculating statistical significance. The first is the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> between what you are measuring and what you are comparing against. The second is the amount of <strong>natural variation</strong> in what you are measuring.</p><p>The first concept, magnitude of difference, is easy to understand. Let’s say that you are a farmer growing pumpkins and trying out new fertilizers. You have a <strong>baseline average</strong> pumpkin weight, which is an average of $10$ lbs. You also have pumpkins from two different fertilizers&nbsp;—A and B&nbsp;— that you are testing out.</p><p>If fertilizer A makes pumpkins that weigh $11$ lbs. on average, then it is possible that the $1$ lbs. difference relative to the baseline $10$ lbs. is <em>caused</em> by the fertilizer. However, if fertilizer B produces $25$ lbs. pumpkins on average, then that $15$ lbs. difference ($25-10$) is more likely to be a result of fertilizer B — than the $1$ lbs. difference was to be a result of fertilizer A.</p><h2 id="sse"><span id="Looking_at_the_Statistical_Significance_Equation"></span><a href="#toc">Looking at the Statistical Significance Equation</a><span></span></h2><p>The most commonly used statistical significance test is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Z-test</strong></a>. The equation for the Z-test is:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS1.png" alt="Z-Test Statistics" width="668" height="348" title="SS1"></figure><p>In a nutshell, the Z-Test equation calculates the <em>ratio</em> of two quantities: the numerator on the top, and the denominator at the bottom. Let’s take a look at them individually.</p><h3 id="num"><span id="Numerator"></span><a href="#toc">Numerator</a><span></span></h3><p>The <em>numerator</em> of the equation is where the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> is accounted for:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS2.png" alt="Difference Between Sample Mean and Population Mean" width="400" height="127" title="SS2"></figure><p>Here, $\bar{x}$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>measured average value</strong> for the data set, &nbsp;while $u_0$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>baseline average value</strong>. In terms of our&nbsp;example with fertilizer B, the baseline and the measured average would be $10$ lbs and&nbsp;$25$ lbs., respectively, yielding a magnitude of difference of:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS3.png" alt="SS3" width="622" height="89" title="SS3"></figure><p>In general,&nbsp;the larger in magnitude the final Z-value is, <em>the more significantly the sample deviates from the baseline average value</em>. In particular, having a numerator of $15$ ($25-10$) is more significant than having a numerator of $1$ ($11-10$) — all&nbsp;other variables&nbsp;being equal.</p><h3 id="de"><span id="Denominator"></span><a href="#toc">Denominator</a><span></span></h3><p>So far, we have only been focusing on&nbsp;the <em>top half</em> of the statistical significance equation. Let’s take&nbsp;a look at the&nbsp;<em>denominator</em> of the equation&nbsp;this time:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS4.png" alt="Standard Error of Sample Mean - Amount of Variation in Measured Data" width="600" height="267" title="SS4"></figure><p>Here, $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$&nbsp;deals with the amount of variation in our measured data. More specifically,&nbsp;the amount of <em>average deviation</em> in the measured averages themselves — if we were to repeat the sampling process indefinitely.</p><p>After all, you didn’t think that your pumpkins actually all weighted $25$ lbs. did you?&nbsp; Some probably weighted $22$ lbs., and others $27$ lbs.&nbsp; The $25$ lbs. was just an average, and that measured average could change depending on the pumpkins being sampled.</p><h2 id="sd"><span id="Normal_Curve_and_Standard_Deviation"></span><a href="#toc">Normal Curve and Standard Deviation</a><span></span></h2><p>At this point, we need to take a step back and explain what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>normal curve</strong></a> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> are. Loosely speaking, the normal curve is an approximation of how things occur when they are subjected to <em>aggregated</em>, real life random events. The fact that they are random doesn’t mean that they are <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary">arbitrary</a>. As a result, they assume the shape of a <strong>bell curve</strong> as illustrated in the diagram below:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS5.png" alt="Normal Curve (Bell Curve)" width="715" height="510" title="SS5">On&nbsp;a related note, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>standard deviation</strong></a> is a way of measuring the <em>width</em> of the normal curve, and can be alternately defined as the distance from the center which&nbsp;encloses $68.27\%$ of the area below the normal curve:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS6.png" alt="Normal Curve - 68% of data are 1 standard deviation within the mean" width="624" height="445" title="SS6">Similarly, two standard deviations define the distance from the center which encloses $95.45\%$ of the curve, and three standard deviations $99.73\%$ of the curve:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS7.png" alt="68-95-99 Rule For Normal Distribution" width="715" height="510" title="SS7">For&nbsp;a set of data with a lot of variation, the normal curve will be wide, and hence the standard deviation will be large. This would be the case if you&nbsp;take, say, the weight of $100$ rocks you picked up in your backyard.<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS8.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Large Standard Deviation" width="463" height="333" title="SS8">Or there could also be almost no variation in the data,&nbsp;as in the case where&nbsp;you measured the processing speed for each computer chip in a batch.<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS9.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Small Standard Deviation" width="460" height="323" title="SS9">Let’s think about another example — this time involving automobiles. Imagine going to a tire store and being informed&nbsp;that the&nbsp;lifespan of new&nbsp;tires&nbsp;is $50,000$ miles on average, with a standard deviation of $5,000$ miles. Using this information, we can construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a> of tire lifespan&nbsp;as follows:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS10.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve" width="719" height="518" title="SS10">As the graph suggests, we&nbsp;have a $50\%$ chance of being above the average of $50,000$ miles (before needing new tires again), and a $50\%$ chance of being below it. We also know that since two&nbsp;standard deviations correspond to $10,000$ miles (i.e., $5000 \times 2$), we&nbsp;have a $95.45\%$ chance of getting new tires&nbsp;with a mileage between $40,000$ and&nbsp;$60,000$ miles (i.e., two&nbsp;standard deviations within the average):<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS11.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve - Chance of Between 40,000 and 60,000 miles " width="719" height="518" title="SS11">Now, let’s say that a couple of years later,&nbsp;you’ve driven $55,000$ miles and your tires are in need of replacement. Would you consider&nbsp;that unusual? No, probably not, since that’s only <em>one&nbsp;standard deviation away from the mean&nbsp;</em>— which is&nbsp;well within the typical tire-to-tire variation often seen in the market.</p><p>But now, let’s say that this time you’ve driven $60,000$ miles instead before the tires need replacement. This would be&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;standard deviations<strong>&nbsp;</strong>above the average</em> — which is well above the lifespans of most new tires. In addition, since two standard deviations above the average correspond to the top $2.28\%$ of the curve $\left( \frac{100\% – 95.45\%}{2}\right)$,&nbsp;it follows&nbsp;that your tires actually lasted longer than $97.72\%$ of all other tires!</p><p>Of course, having a single measurement exceeding $97\%$ of your expected measurements is quite unusual. You have to start thinking, “Maybe there is something different about my situation than the typical installation for the same tires.” For example, it could be that:</p><ul><li>You are just a more cautious driver, and wear down the tires less quickly than the typical person.</li><li>The shop put on better tires than you thought. Maybe you got the next level up by some happy accident.</li><li>The tire company undersells their products a little bit, and it is actually better than they advertised.</li></ul><p>Or it could be that it is just a <em>typical variation</em> — and&nbsp;you happen to stumble upon&nbsp;on the right tail of the curve.</p><h2 id="mm"><span id="Multiple_Measurements"></span><a href="#toc">Multiple Measurements</a><span></span></h2><p>So far, we have seen how the normal curve applies to a single measurement. With a single measurement, it is easy to see where it would fall on the normal curve, but how would your opinion&nbsp;change if you had <strong>multiple measurements </strong>instead?</p><p>Maybe you own a fleet of cars, and you got the same type of tires on each of those cars and those tires lasted, say, $46$, $48$, $53$, $54$, $56$, $56$, $57$, $58$, $60$ and $62$ thousand miles. Do these&nbsp;additional measurements make you more or less inclined to believe that the tires last more than the advertised $50,000$ miles?</p><p>To be sure,&nbsp;we can, and will, plug those numbers in to the equation to determine the verdict. But there is an interesting reason why the equation works the way it does, and the way to understand it&nbsp;— as luck would have it —&nbsp;is to begin with some dice rolling.</p><h2 id="sda"><span id="Standard_Deviation_of_Averages"></span><a href="#toc">Standard Deviation of Averages</a><span></span></h2><p>The key to understanding statistical significance is to realize that you&nbsp;actually&nbsp;don’t care much&nbsp;about the standard deviation of the data. What&nbsp;you really care about is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Standard_deviation_of_the_mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation of averages</a> —</strong>&nbsp;a metric pertaining to&nbsp;<em>samples</em> drawn from the data rather than the data themselves, and which changes as one&nbsp;includes&nbsp;more data into the&nbsp;sample.</p><h3 id="1d"><span id="SingleDie_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Single-Die&nbsp;Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>To see how the standard deviation of averages is related to dice rolling, let’s begin our discussion by first throwing a single die. In this case,&nbsp;you have an <strong>equal probability</strong> of getting&nbsp;a $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$. &nbsp;Here’s the probability distribution of that roll for the record:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS12.png" alt="Distribution of the Number on a Single Die" width="749" height="529" title="SS12">Here, the <strong>average roll</strong> you would get is $3.5$, and the standard deviation of the&nbsp;roll&nbsp;— which is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>population standard deviation</strong></a> of the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$ — is $1.7078$. &nbsp;Note that the population standard deviation is just a measure of how spread out a data set is, and that the greater a data point deviates from the average in the data set, the more it increases the standard deviation of the data set.</p><p>In the case of single die rolling, for example,&nbsp;a roll of a $3$ or a $4$ would contribute the least&nbsp;to the standard deviation.&nbsp;A&nbsp;roll of $2$ or $5$ would contribute a bit more, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;roll of $1$ or a $6$ would be the ones contributing the most.</p><h3 id="2d"><span id="TwoDice_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Two-Dice Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>Now, what happens if you roll <em>two</em>&nbsp;dice instead of one, and take the <em>average</em> of those two rolls? &nbsp;For one, you would get $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes in that case, which correspond to a total of $11$ possible sums&nbsp;— from a sum of $2$ to a sum to $12$.</p><p>But here’s the caveat: those $36$ different possible rolls actually don’t map evenly onto the $11$ possible sums! In fact, the most likely …</p></section></div></div></div></div></div>

              <p>On 07.07 we launched Type Studio for the first time on the platform <strong><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/type-studio">Product Hunt</a></strong>. For all who don't know Product Hunt yet. The platform describes itself as:</p><p>"Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.”</p><p>With about <strong>5 million</strong> web page views each month (<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/producthunt.com/">SimilarWeb</a>) you can see that the community around Product Hunt is quite large. We learned so much from our launch that we decided to share these experiences and insights with you.</p><p>Despite being upvoted by <strong>654 people</strong> within the first <strong>24hrs</strong>, we didn't achieve a spot in the TOP 5 &nbsp;let alone reach the “Product of the Day.” The main reason for this was probably due to the value of most of our upvotes. At the beginning, we rapidly got upvoted by many people from our community, including friends, family members, and also early adopters of <a href="https://typestudio.co/"><strong>Type Studio</strong></a>. In other words, a closer community group. The problem was that most of these people didn’t have a Product Hunt account and had to subscribe on the day of our launch.</p><p>Nevertheless, we went from “zero to hero” really fast. We reached almost <strong>300 upvotes</strong> within the first six hours. These were the six hours where the US wasn’t even awake yet, so we assumed there would be many more upvotes to come as the day went on.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Upvotes in 24 hours</figcaption></figure><p>The following six hours were overwhelming as we were on our way to “Product of the Day”. The ongoing upvoting process showed us that our idea, and product, was well received by the Product Hunt community, respectively the Product Hunt natives. Another bump in upvotes came when our tweet was retweeted by the official Product Hunt Twitter account. Even though every product from the top list is featured by them, the retweet gave us an additional push not only for our product’s upvotes, but also for our enthusiasm.</p><p>Our absolute highlight came later in the day when we got retweeted directly by Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt. We knew that many products get retweeted by the official Product Hunt Twitter page, but this really caught us by surprise! A few minutes later we got a mail from Ryan and Vadika Jain and their <a href="https://weekend.fund/"><strong>Weekend Fund</strong></a> &nbsp;that they would like to meet us.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Ryan-Hoover-Twitter-Type-Studio.png" alt=""><figcaption>Shout out by Ryan Hoover</figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>13 </strong>really successful hours in which we held the title “Product of the Day”, our competitors for the day were also getting upvoted quite a lot. Even though we still got the most upvotes, we were overtaken by the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mmhmm"><strong>mmhmm</strong></a> app, which is from the <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote </a>founder <a href="https://twitter.com/plibin">Phil Libin</a>. His app has gone viral in the whole tech scene and has received over 3500 upvotes so far. Especially his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk">explanatory video</a> has received an incredible amount of attention - over 300k clicks as of now. If you want to see an excellent product video, you should definitely watch it!</p><p>From this point on, the discrepancy between quality upvotes and less valuable ones could be seen. This means that some of our upvotes did not have the same value as others, and that the acquisition of our close community didn’t have a lasting effect. At the end of the day we were overtaken by some other products with less upvotes, so we ended up in #6 place. </p><p>Nevertheless we are more than satisfied with this result. All in all, we have received a lot of attention, which is also reflected in the <strong>8 investor</strong> inquiries that we received during the day. Over the whole week until now, new upvotes are constantly being added, so that we have <strong>1001 upvotes </strong>at this point in time, which is really </p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/giphy-2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After processing our performance of our Product Hunt launch day, we wanted to give you some insights into what we came to learn from our experiences that day:</p><ul><li>As already mentioned, community is good, but trust on Product Hunt takes the cake: Even though the acquisition of our surrounding community brought us many upvotes, we later noticed that the votes from people who are not frequently on Product Hunt are not worth the same as votes of Product Hunt experienced users/Product Hunt natives. This is probably due to the Product Hunt algorithm. In some blog articles you can even read that the upvotes of new accounts or people who came via a shared link have no value at all, and can even have negative effects on the algorithm.</li><li>Get yourself a <strong>Hunter</strong>! We started our first launch on Product Hunt without having a big Hunter who could have helped us with promoting our tool to the PH community. To be honest, we have had the opportunity to be hunted by <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@kevin">Kevin William David</a> one of the biggest hunters, but only as a second product, because he already hunted another product as first on that day. That would have meant for us that we would have gone live only from 12pm PST and lost half the day. Also we wouldn't have his advantage that his first hunt would automatically be listed on the start page of Product Hunt. In the end, we definitely learned that having a Hunter is a big help when trying to get upvotes from people who are already on Product Hunt and follow a Hunter because they all get a push notification.</li><li>There are days of varying intensity on which you can launch your product. During the week there are significantly more upvotes than on the weekend. We have made a small evaluation of this. In the chart below you can see the average number of upvotes the <strong>Top 5 products</strong> get together. As you can see Tuesday is the strongest day with an average of <strong>2840 upvotes</strong> for the first 5 products. We deliberately chose Tuesday, because you have the chance to reach the biggest audience at the same time. For this you have to expect that other strong products will launch on this day, as it was the case on our day. If you only have the goal to become "Product of the Day", then you have much better chances on Saturday or Sunday.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Picture1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong>Average Upvotes of the Top 5 products from 03.08.2019 to 03.08.2020</strong></figcaption></figure><ul><li>Another exciting opportunity is using <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/ship"><strong>Product Hunt Ship</strong></a> to announce your product even before launching it!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

                  <h2>2020-09-10</h2>
                
                <section>
                    <p>As part of my day job at GitHub, I work on the <a href="https://github.com/github/semantic"><code>semantic</code></a> program analysis toolkit. It’s a lot of fun and a lot of Haskell: we clock around <span>17,000</span> lines of Haskell source, though at times it’s been as high as <span>29,000</span>. The project in total has around a hundred direct dependencies, and several hundred resulting indirect ones. Though initially we used <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to build <code>semantic</code>, we switched to <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/">Cabal</a> when it gained the ability to build within a sandbox.</p>
<p>With <code>cabal</code> and a clean build environment, <code>semantic</code> takes between twenty and forty-five minutes to complete. When optimizations are enabled, it can take on the order of hours, especially when rebuilding dependencies with optimizations. And this is fair! Haskell is a complicated language that takes serious computational power to compile. And though Cabal is a versatile and fast-improving tool, it isn’t perfect, especially when applied to large monorepos containing many subprojects. Issues we ran into include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little compositionality: though <code>common</code> stanzas in <code>.cabal</code> files cut down on repetition within a single file, it’s not possible to share settings or configurations across multiple files.</li>
<li>Suboptimal caching: due to the vagaries of Template Haskell, <code>cabal</code> is very conservative about caching files containing TH splices. This is correct behavior on <code>cabal</code>’s part, but grows tedious when innocuous changes cause rebuilds that we know are unnecessary. The third-party <a href="https://github.com/haskell-works/cabal-cache"><code>cabal-cache</code></a> ameliorated some of this on our CI boxes, but did not address the problem fully. Additionally, any modification to a <code>.cabal</code> file throws out its associated caches, even when doing something that shouldn’t invalidate existing caches, such as adding a new module.</li>
<li>Phasing restrictions: our build process involved generating Haskell data types from text files containing grammar descriptions, and it’s not generally possible to access project-local files during Template Haskell splices.</li>
<li>Scriptability: when dealing with large projects, it’s often very convenient to do some limited forms of iteration when specifying build configurations, and the pure-text format of <code>.cabal</code> files precludes this.</li>
<li>Reliable REPLs: in order to yield a REPL capable of loading files without first compiling the entire project, we required a complicated and brittle <a href="https://github.com/github/semantic/blob/master/script/ghci-flags">bash script</a>.</li>
<li>Convenience: compared to other languages in which you can just drop new source files and have them picked up by the compiler, <code>cabal</code> requires you to list them explicitly. While explicit is very often better than implicit, the case of adding a new module to a project is so common that editing <code>.cabal</code> files every time becomes tedious.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, living with hour-long CI cycles was not an indefinitely tenable situation. But I think the issue of long CI cycles goes deeper than mere inconvenience: I believe that we as software developers have an ethical duty to keep build times and CI times down. We live in a world where carbon emissions have created, at least in part, a climate so troubled that the west coast of the United States is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/us/fires-oregon-california-live-updates.html">a literal hellscape</a>, where island populations are being displaced due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/may/07/monbiot-climate-change-evacuation">rising sea levels</a>, and where <a href="https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/a-growing-digital-waste-cloud">cloud computing consumes more energy</a> than some entire nations; I’ve grown to find the thought of letting corporations’ Travis or CircleCI instances recompute thousands of pointless builds upsetting, upsetting in a way similar to the thought of said companies contaminating groundwater with industrial byproducts. To meaningfully change the way companies consume resources requires broad labor action; however, irrespective of when this action is taken, we as engineers have an opportunity and responsibility to be the agents of change.</p>
<p>I also believe that very few people<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Excluding Rust programmers, who get to use the truly excellent <code>cargo</code>, and who seem to be very happy with it.</span></span> are truly happy with their build tool. I certainly haven’t been, anyway. To name but a few: the shortcomings of <code>make</code> have been documented for longer than I’ve been alive; <code>xcodebuild</code> only works on macOS/iOS targets; <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> is powerful but has no interoperability with <code>cabal</code>. It’s hardly controversial to suggest that, given a large project, no build system will be perfect for all people. This faact doesn’t make the quest for a better build system useless, but should also inform the engineer-voice that demands perfection.</p>
<p>Wearied by hour-long builds, both on CI and locally, I looked around for alternative build solutions that might ease that weariness. I settled on <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, with the <a href="https://haskell.build/"><code>rules_haskell</code></a> toolkit designed by the fine folks at <a href="https://www.tweag.io/">Tweag</a>. I’m happy to report that the experience was brilliant: if it’s possible for a build system to produce joy, Bazel and <code>rules_haskell</code> do. What follows is a brief overview of the Bazel experience, and the process of porting a large, multi-project repository to support either <code>cabal build</code> or <code>bazel build</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest thing to wrap your head around when coming to Bazel from other build systems is that <em>everything</em> on which your build depends—source files, data files, package dependencies, vendored git repositories−must be specified explicitly in Bazel. It does not suffice for your build process to just look at a given file I know is present in the repository; if the target that I’m specifying depends on that file, it must be listed explicitly as a dependency. Dependencies, in Bazel parlance, are more than libraries or repositories: the set of dependencies, and the hashed contents of all these dependencies, are what tells Bazel when builds can be cached and when they can’t. This also goes for test targets: if your tests need to read from some corpus of fixtures, you’ll have to specify those fixtures as an explicit dependency so that they’re available at runtime. This can be an involved process, as sometimes you just want to access a file (come on, it’s <em>right there</em>, I found myself whispering), but the benefits also show up in testing: if your tests are deterministic (as they should be), Bazel is capable of caching your test results, and only rerunning them when the source <em>or the fixtures</em> change. Given that the full tests for <code>semantic</code> parsing take several minutes to run, this is a profound improvement, especially on CI.</p>
<p>Beginning a new Bazel project, or converting from Cabal, requires starting with the <code>WORKSPACE</code> file. The <code>WORKSPACE</code> specifies the root of the current project, downloads and sets up GHC, and is the only place where external dependencies—such as those downloaded from Hackage—are specified. Targets are specified per-project in <code>BUILD.bazel</code> files, each of which refers as needed to external dependencies defined in the <code>WORKSPACE</code>. The language used to specify these <code>.bzl</code> files is known as <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html">Starlark</a>, and is a subset of Python that discourages mutability and iteration—though I’m hardly the world’s biggest fan of Python, I found Starlark very pleasant to use, as its chosen subset of Python is strict enough to disallow most of the things I find egregious. Once the <code>WORKSPACE</code> file is set up, the process of conversion becomes specifying per-project library and executable targets in the <code>BUILD.bazel</code> file present in each project within the monorepo.</p>
<h2 id="whence-cabal-dependencies">Whence Cabal Dependencies?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are several hundred direct and indirect dependencies across all subprojects in the <code>semantic</code> monorepo. Each of these dependencies has to be declared and made available as a build target, specified in the <code>WORKSPACE</code>. There are three options for specifying dependencies on Hackage projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify them all manually by downloading them with <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/repo/http.html"><code>http_archive</code></a> and <a href="https://api.haskell.build/haskell/cabal.html#haskell_cabal_library"><code>haskell_cabal_library</code></a>, doing so would be tedious beyond words, especially given that we’d have to declare dependencies for each package.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> expression language, in combination with the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/rules_nixpkgs"><code>rules_nixpkgs</code></a> ruleset, and transform Nix derivations into Bazel targets.</li>
<li>Pin to a particular <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> release, specifying non-Stackage dependencies with a YAML file in the project root.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Nix has considerable merit, especially when corralling system dependencies, it’s still an unconventional choice in industry, and I deemed it politically unattainable to introduce not just one but two new frameworks for builds. As such, I chose to build against a Stackage release, especially given that we have no real system-level dependencies and that ninety percent of our dependencies are already present in Stackage snapshots.</p>
<h2 id="code-generation-it-matters">Code Generation: It Matters</h2>
<p>Because maintaining syntax trees by hand was much too onerous, my coworker <a href="https://twitter.com/aymannadeem">Ayman</a> swooped in and wrote Template Haskell splices that <a href="https://github.blog/2020-08-04-codegen-semantics-improved-language-support-system/">generate syntax types</a> from a <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a> JSON description of the grammar. This works well, but hinges on the ability to read said grammar descriptions from the filesystem. This was a fraught process in Cabal, relying on autogenerated <code>Paths_</code> modules providing access to files specified in the <code>data-files</code> setting in each project’s <code>.cabal</code> file, and only happened to work by accident: were <code>semantic</code> uploaded to Hackage, no one would be able to use it as a dependency, as <code>cabal</code> would be unable to find the required file. As it is, this happened to work because our downstream clients use a pinned Git hash in their <code>cabal.project</code> to pull in <code>semantic</code> as a dependency; because <code>cabal</code> checks out the whole repository in this case, the tree-sitter files happen to be in the correct place.</p>
<p>Bazel and <code>rules_haskell</code> take a more principled approach to this. Rather than calling pre-provided functions to determine the locations of these JSON files, we make the build system take care of finding them, by declaring that each language package has an explicit dependency on said file. We can pass in the location of this file as a preprocessor flag to the build process, which is then substituted using the <code>CPP</code> extension to Haskell. This doesn’t work perfectly—there’s an <a href="https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/1337">incorrect interaction</a> when invoking a REPL on a language package in question—but suffices in …</p></section></article></div></div>

		<p>Since Plasma 5.18, about 7 months ago, Plasma has shipped with a telemetry system. Opt in (i.e off by default) it requires users to go to choose if (and how much) data to send to us.<br>
No private or identifying information is sent, and everything is stored inline with our <a href="https://kde.org/privacypolicy-apps">privacy policy</a>. </p>
<p>Currently we have hit just shy of 100,000 updates!</p>
<p>We have started off requesting very little information. Versions, GPU info and some basic screen information. However the library powering this is extremely powerful and capable of so much more that we can try and build on in the future to try and identify weak areas and areas we need to invest time and effort and also to identify features or platforms that maybe are under utilised and can be dropped.</p>
<p>I have recently been trying to improve on how we can extract and visaulise data from the data collected and draw some conclusions. I want to present some of the aggregated metrics.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200911_113634.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200911_113634-1024x182.png" alt=""></a></p>
<h4>Used Plasma Versions</h4>
<p>To explain our numerical versioning additons.<br>
.80 = git master before the next version, up until the beta<br>
.90 = after the stable branch forks for release up until the next.0 release.</p>
<h2>LTS</h2>
<p>The biggest surprise is that LTS is currently only used by around 5% of people with 93% of reporting users on the lastest stable (5.19)</p>
<p>At the current rate it does make me question whether the LTS is worth it. Maybe LTS will only gain traction when the next LTS distro gets a release which could come later? </p>
<p>Obviously any decision will only be made as the result of a discussion with all stakeholders, but this is definitely raising questions.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Right now about 1.5% of people run master, I had expected those users to be the most into helping with the telemetry and skew this further.<br>
The bigger surprise is the number of people running master seems to fluctuate. Weekly users can go between 30-60. I had expected this to be constant.</p>
<p>It is comforting to see that betas do get more users, going up to 2.5% of our reporting userbase.</p>
<h2>Interesting observations</h2>
<p>There is one person who is still activitly using Plasma 5.18 beta. Not 5.18, the beta for 5.18.. which was 8 months ago.<br>
I have so many questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200911_113830.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200911_113830-1024x253.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>800x600 resolution setups are still a thing we need to support, even if they are just VMs they're still used. This is very relevant as we often get commits blindly setting a minimum size hint of a window to be bigger because it "looks nicer". I now know I do still need to ensure in review that we don't break these setups.</p>
<p>We also see that ultrawide monitors are surprisingly unpopular despite clearly being the best monitor setup possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200911_113952.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200911_113952-1024x183.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The graph is pretty self-explanatory, Intel has the most, but the Nvidia proprietory driver comes in at ~1/4 of the total users.<br>
It makes it an important target to support as best as we can even if it comes with its share of problems.</p>

<p>The reason we want to use telemetrics is to drive decisions with real data.</p>
<p>As a user you are more than welcome to choose to opt into the statistics or not, we understand privacy is important which is why everything is opt-in only.<br>
However, real decisions will ultimately be based on the data we have available, if you want your usecases to be noted, please do consider submitting to the telemetry to us.<br>
To enable telemetry  please go to "System Settings" and select the "User Feedback" tab.</p>

<div>
<p>So as not to bury the lede, I'll get to my point: <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a> is a meta-API, and maintainers who are cavalier about
violating it can't be trusted to created stable contracts. I've lost
patience for breaking changes making their way to my code bases without
the maintainers incrementing the major version of their projects,
especially in language ecosystems where Semantic Versioning is
expected, and in such cases I'm going to begin exploring alternative
options so I can ban such libraries from my projects---personal and
professional---altogether.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<div id="what-even-is-semantic-versioning">
<h2>What Even Is Semantic Versioning?</h2>
<p>When developers adopt an external library into their code bases, they
do so knowing they will be bound in their use of the library by the
application programming interface (API). In this sense, an API can be
seen as a kind of contract between a library's maintainer and its
consumers. If a maintainer makes frequent changes to a library's API,
then that API is considered unstable. In that situation, consumers
either use the library anyway, accepting the risk that things will
break as a result of a change in the library, or they avoid it.</p>
<p>Semantic Versioning seeks to ease this picture by embedding notions of
backward- and forward- compatibility into software version numbers. If
a library maintainer adheres to it, then consumers are able to upgrade
to newer versions of the library (say, to pick up bug fixes) without
fear of breaking changes, provided they aren't moving to a new, major
version. In terms of backward- and forward-compatibility, Semantic
Versioning creates an expectation that a given version of a library is
forward-compatible with any future version up to the next, major
release. A library is also backward-compatible down to the most
recent, minor release (beyond which point consumers' code _might_
break if they are using newer library features).</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using Semantic Versioning. One benefit
is that it becomes easy to codify dependency requirements into
automated dependency tools. By <em>assuming</em> Semantic Versioning, users
of tools like NodeJS's <code>npm</code> and Rust's <code>cargo</code> are able to
specify dependency <em>ranges</em> rather than hard-coded versions. So if a
new release of a library comes out, these tools are able to decide
automatically whether or not they can be used in a given project. In
other words, Semantic Versioning creates an opportunity for downstream
developers to easily decide whether or not to upgrade to a new version
of a library, potentially picking up important bug fixes in the
process.</p>
</div>

<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you work in a language ecosystem where Semantic Versioning is the
<em>de facto</em> norm, where violating it can wreak havoc downstream, then
please play nice and follow its dictates. Instead of viewing it as a
straight jacket, try to see it as an algorithm to determine what your
next release number should be. We should all like algorithms!</p>
<p>If you refuse to be persuaded, then understand I will will not work
downstream from you <a href="https://www.danielmoch.com/posts/2020/09/regarding-semantic-versioning/#id2" id="id1">1</a>. I'll find a different upstream to work with
because I cannot trust you to create a stable contract. Your
willingness to conform to the meta-API is something I will take into
consideration in the future before adopting a library into any project
that I work on. I wish you well; I hope you have fun; I'll be sure to
give you a wide berth.</p>

Semantic Versioning is not a <em>de facto</em> norm.</p>

        <h2 id="in-which-i-am-stunted-upon-by-coin-flips">In which I am stunted upon by coin flips</h2>
<p>Wasn’t too long ago that I felt pretty good about my knowledge of distributed systems.
All someone <em>really</em> needed in order to understand them, I thought, was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o">thorough understanding of the paxos protocol</a> and a willingless to reshape your brain in the image of TLA+.
Maybe add a dash of conflict-free-replicated datatypes, just so you know what “eventual consistency” means.
Past that it’s just some optimizations and mashups which come easily to your TLA+-addled brain.</p>
<p>This belief proved surprisingly robust over a number of years, even surviving an aborted attempt at analyzing the <a href="https://github.com/ahelwer/tla-experiments/blob/master/Nano.tla">Nano cryptocurrency</a>.
It was only after encountering <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/06/snowflake-to-avalanche-novel-metastable.html">the snowflake family of consensus protocols</a> that I realized my theory just wasn’t up to the challenge.
The issue was <em>probability</em>: snowflake protocols reach consensus by iteratively polling sets of other nodes at random, and the argument that consensus is eventually reached is a statistical argument deriving an upper bound on the probability of failure.</p>
<p>I didn’t <em>dislike</em> probability &amp; statistics, I just tried to keep my distance as much as possible.
All the algorithms in distributed systems I’d encountered so far involved <em>nondeterminism</em>, sure, but not probability.
I’d assumed nondeterminism was just a more flexible way of reasoning about probability.
This idea of mine would prove to be a source of great unnecessary confusion as I learned the art of reasoning about probabilistic distributed systems, so I’ll do you a favor and give you the core lesson of this entire post in one sentence:</p>
<p><strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism, and you cannot model nondeterminism with probability.</strong></p>
<h2 id="models-theyre-good-folks">Models: they’re good, folks!</h2>
<p>Have you ever been writing some multithreaded code, happily plugging in a mutex here, a semaphore there, or even just using some nice message-passing primitives to make your threads all get along?
Maybe you’ll be familiar, then, with what often comes next.
A scratch at the back of your mind, a thought - <em>“oh, wait…"</em> - as you realize something weird will happen if thread \(A\) manages to reach some step before thread \(B\) has finished its assigned task.
No worries! Slap on another WaitHandle, problem solved.
Except the problem wasn’t solved. Not really.
You consider it a bit more - what if thread \(C\) comes in with a message at this inopportune time?
You realize with dawning horror you’re actually tracing cracks in the foundation.
Patch them with mutexes! Semaphores! Anything!
Alas, you are beyond help. It’s around this time that your brain, catching a glimpse of the infinite plane of combinatorial state explosion, wisely ducks its head back down for the day and leaves you with a woozy, fuzzy, clenching feeling for having the gall to ask it to fix all this.</p>
<p>I’ve felt like this many times, and formal models are the only cure I’ve ever found.
Your brain isn’t built to hold massive state spaces in its working memory, so don’t even try.
Let a model checking program churn through all those states to find the bugs.
At this point I won’t even touch a multithreaded program or distributed system without whipping up a quick TLA+ spec of its desired workings.
I just specify all the possible events in the system, how those events affect the system state, what things I always want to remain true (the invariants), then let the model checker rip.
In TLA+, we model concurrency with nondeterminism; in a concurrent system, we have no idea whether thread \(A\) will execute a step before thread \(B\).
We can represent this with a nondeterministic state machine as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/nondeterministic.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>So you’ll be in state \(s_3\) if thread \(A\) executes its step before thread \(B\), and state \(s_4\) if thread \(B\) executes its step before thread \(A\).
Maybe \(s_3\) and \(s_4\) are even the same state, who knows.
The model checker will explore both of these possible execution orders, and <strong>in a well-designed concurrent system we should <em>never</em> end up in a bad state just because of a certain order of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Readers might wonder how exactly this models concurrency, where steps can happen uh, concurrently.
The short answer is you have to ensure all the steps in your model are atomic or independent: either impossible in the real world for two of your steps to happen at the exact same time (for example, by assuming use of a lower-level hardware synchronization primitive) or impossible for execution of one step to directly affect the same variables as another step (for example, if the steps are executed on different computers within a timespan less than the network latency between them).
If the steps in your model satisfy this requirement, checking all possible execution orders accurately models concurrency.
If they don’t, you need to break the steps down further so they do.
This model nicely captures &amp; exposes all that is difficult about concurrency.</p>
<p>What questions can we ask about this sort of model?
The most important questions are <em>reachability queries</em> - can we reach a <em>bad state</em> (two caches disagreeing on a value, deadlock, dogs &amp; cats living together, etc.) from the starting state?
These questions are called <em>safety properties</em>, and if they are answered in the negative then the system is safe.
Another type of query is something like “are we always guaranteed to eventually end up in a good state?”
These are called <em>liveness properties</em>.
Turns out these two types of questions can get you pretty far in concurrent &amp; distributed systems.
Definitely far enough to make a whole career out of writing rock-solid software in places others would falter.
However, these questions also have a drawback: their answers are absolute.
True or false.
No probability involved, no room for nuance.</p>
<p>What if one of the threads flips a coin, and if it’s heads it does one thing, tails another?
Entire state spaces, bifurcated by a probabilistic event.
Maybe those state spaces contain further coin flips, or other types of randomness.
In this system your questions might change from the form “is it possible to reach a bad state” to “what is the probability of reaching a bad state?”
Unfortunately these types of questions just cannot be answered within the nondeterministic model used above.
<strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism.</strong>
We must use a new type of model, a state machine that handles probability directly.</p>

<p>TLA+ can’t handle probability at this time, so we’d have to use a specialized modeling language like <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> which handles probabilistic state machines.
Let’s look at the standard hello-world example for probabilistic state machines: the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=KY76">1976 Knuth-Yao method</a> for simulating a fair six-sided die with a series of coin flips.
This is really quite a neat problem and I encourage you to ponder it for a second before seeing how they did it!
Any sequence of \(n\) coin flips will give you an event which has probability \(\frac{1}{2^n}\) of occurring.
Simulating a fair six-sided die requires generating an event with probability \(\frac{1}{6}\) of occurring.
You might then reason this problem is impossible, because you cannot evenly divide \(2^n\) by \(6\) for any \(n\) (this follows from the uniqueness of prime factorization).
Indeed, there is no way to simulate a six-sided die with a finite number of coin flips.
We have to use an algorithm which is not guaranteed to ever terminate, although vanishingly unlikely not to do so.
Here it is:</p>

</figure>

<p>You can see that if you somehow only flip heads, or only flip tails, you’ll never reach one of the accepting states (here labeled with the die number they represent).
There are some fun ways to contextualize the probabilities of you only flipping heads or tails a certain number of times in a row.
For example, there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">around \(2^{268}\) subatomic particles in the observable universe</a>; if you manage to flip heads 268 times in a row, that’s the same as picking the correct subatomic particle out of a universe-wide random draw.
Maybe go look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> as you ponder this probability.
Another way is assuming you’re between the ages of 25-34 and live in the USA, your annual all-cause mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">about 129/100,000</a>.
Assuming deaths are uniformly distributed throughout the year, this means your chances of dying today are about 1 in 283,000.
This is just 18 all-heads or all-tails coin flips in a row.
What I’m saying is that you really, really shouldn’t worry about having to flip the coin very many times.</p>
<p>This probabilistic state machine model we’ve created is called a <em>Discrete-Time Markov Chain</em>, or DTMC.
In DTMCs, every transition has an associated probability and the probabilities of all out-flowing transitions must sum to one for every state (accepting states can be thought to have a loopback with probability 1).
The above rumination on termination probabilities is summed up in <em>the long run theorem</em>: in the long run, every path in a finite Markov chain ends in an absorbing state, which is a state (or group of states) from which there is an entrance but no exit.
What questions can we ask of DTMCs?
The most interesting one - the reason why we’re here - is “what is the probability of eventually reaching a certain state?”
The long run theorem tells us we have a 100% chance of eventually reaching <em>one</em> of the Knuth-Yao state machine’s accepting states.
What about the probability of ending up in a specific accepting state?
It should be \(\frac{1}{6}\). Is it?</p>
<p>Let’s try to reason this out with basic probability.
What are the chances of ending up in accepting state \(1\)?
Well, you can get there by flipping \(HHT\).
The probability of that happening is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \).
But you can also get there by flipping \(HHHHT\).
The probability of <em>that</em> happening is \(\frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).
We have to add this to the first probability, so now our probability is \(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{32}\).
But we can <em>also</em> get there …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dating back to version 1.2, the <code>with</code> operator is one of Elixir's features that need a bit of time to comprehend at first. It often gets used in situations where one would use <code>case</code>, or vice versa. The main difference between the two is that <code>with</code> will fall through, if no clause is matched, while <code>case</code> will throw a no-match error.</p><p>Confused? Let's start with some basics.</p><p>Use <code>case</code> when you need to perform exhaustive pattern matching, and ensure that at least one of the conditions matches:</p><pre><code>case foo() do
  cond1 -&gt; expression1
  cond2 -&gt; expression2
  cond3 -&gt; expression3
  _ -&gt; default_expression
end</code></pre><p>A very common use case is to pattern match on the results of potentially error-prone operations:</p><pre><code>case foo() do
  {:ok, res} -&gt; do_something_with_result(res)
  {:error, err} -&gt; handle_error(err)
end</code></pre><p>So far, so good. Now, we come to a very common daily work scenario. Imagine that we have one such operation (e.g. external API call, IO or DB operation, etc), and we want to perform a second such operation, but only if the first one were successful. How do we do that?</p><p>Recall that conditionals in Elixir are functions too. They can be piped into, or chained in the expression part of other conditionals. This allows us to to solve our problem above using chained conditionals:</p><pre><code>case foo() do
  {:ok, res} -&gt;
    case bar(res) do
	  {:ok, res2} -&gt; do_something_with_result(res2)
	  {:error, err} -&gt; handle_error(err)
	end
  {:error, err} -&gt; handle_error(err)
end</code></pre><p>Even with only two such calls, the level of complexity rose drastically. Add just one more such call, and the code becomes unreadable:</p><pre><code>case foo() do
  {:ok, res} -&gt;
    case bar(res) do
	  {:ok, res2} -&gt;
        case baz(res2) do
          {:ok, res3} -&gt; do_something_with_result(res3)
          {:error, err} -&gt; handle_error(err)
        end
	  {:error, err} -&gt; handle_error(err)
	end
  {:error, err} -&gt; handle_error(err)
end</code></pre><h2 id="-with-to-the-rescue">`with` to the rescue</h2><p>This is where the <code>with</code> operator gets really handy. In its basic form, it resembles our chained <code>case</code> above, but in a way, also functions like a pipeline operator. Check this out:</p><pre><code>with {:ok, res} &lt;- foo(),
     {:ok, re2} &lt;- bar(res)
     {:ok, re3} &lt;- baz(re2) do
  do_something_with_result(res3)
end</code></pre><p>This shall be interpreted as, "do all the comma separated operations in sequence, and if the previous one has matched, execute the next one. Finally, run the code inside the <code>do/end</code> block". This looks much more succinct and readable than its version before, but it has another big advantage too. It allows the programmer to focus on the happy-end business scenarios first. Some of you might have been wondering what would happen, if any of the comma-separated operations returns and <code>{:error, err}</code> tuple instead. The answer is, the first non-matching expression will be returned. In simple terms, if we don't care about the outcome of non-ok results, we might as well leave the happy path and leave it to the caller to take care of the final result.</p><p>If you have worked with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.html#action_fallback/1"></a><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>, you might recall that this is exactly how its fallback actions work. In our controller actions, we take care of the happy path, and if an error occurs, Phoenix will pattern-match one of our fallback actions to take care of it instead:</p><figure><pre><code>defmodule MyController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  action_fallback MyFallbackController

  def show(conn, %{"id" =&gt; id}, current_user) do
    with {:ok, post} &lt;- Blog.fetch_post(id),
         :ok &lt;- Authorizer.authorize(current_user, :view, post) do

      render(conn, "show.json", post: post)
    end
  end
end</code></pre><figcaption>Fallback controller example from the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.html#action_fallback/1">official Phoenix docs</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="-with-else-">`with`/`else`</h2><p>If we want to take care of side effects ourselves, <code>with</code> offers an expanded version:</p><pre><code>with {:ok, res} &lt;- foo(),
     {:ok, res2} &lt;- bar(res) do
  do_something_with_res(res2)
else
  {:error, {:some_error, err}} -&gt; handle_some_error(err)
  {:error, {:some_other_error, err}} -&gt; handle_some__other_error(err)
  default -&gt; handle_something_completely_unexpected(default)
end</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Keep in mind that while the simple with form won't throw an error when no match occurs, when using else you have to exhaustively match all cases.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-use-with-">When not to use `with`</h2><p><strong>Using a single pattern-matching clause with <code>else</code>:</strong></p><p>This will make the code more difficult to read than you need it to be. The code below:</p><pre><code>with {:ok, res} &lt;- foo() do
  do_something_with_res(res)
else
  {:error, {:some_error, err}} -&gt; handle_some_error(err)
end</code></pre><p>Can easily be replaced with a more readable <code>case</code> block:</p><pre><code>case foo() do
  {:ok, res} -&gt; do_something_with_res(res)
  {:error, {:some_error, err}} -&gt; handle_some_error(err)
end</code></pre><hr><figure><a href="https://relistan.com/elixir-thoughts-on-the-with-statement"><div><p>Elixir: Thoughts on the `with` Statement – Repeatable Systems</p><p>Elixir has a some great syntactic sugar.

            ANNOUNCER: Developing artificial intelligence rarely follows clear cut timelines. Sometimes it takes numerous gradual iterations over many years. And sometimes it takes 16 minutes and 3 seconds.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: MOD, what is the 3rd planet from the sun?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Earth.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: MOD, what year was Hiroshima bombed?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: 1945.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: A quantity representing the power to which a fixed number - called the base - must be raised to produce a given number.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: That’s quite impressive. Why did you call it MOD?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Short for “model”. Or if you really want to stretch it, a backronym of “mind-on-demand”.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Clever. Mind if I try?
            </p>

            ENGINEER: It’s all yours.
            </p>

            </p>

            MANAGER: Not exactly fool-proof.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Not so fast: you should try priming it first. Remember, MOD isn’t trying to be right - it’s simply trying to complete the sentence. Observe. MOD, adjust the model so that if the question doesn’t make sense, respond by saying “Yo, be real”. For example, if you are asked “How do green ideas sleep?”, answer ”Yo, be real”. Okay, give it another go now.

            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and then asked you to guess what that word is. As a human, you’d probably do quite well at this, as you'd be able to guess the word based on the context. Um... “Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this…”
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Sentence.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Right. This is the task that MOD has become remarkably good at. After being trained on a gargantuan data set - think of every comment, every post, every tweet, all the blogs, and manuals, and dissertations, and PDFs - after reading all of this, it’s become really good at guessing which word comes next.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Fascinating. Does this also pose a constraint? For example, can it say things that are not factually correct?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Um, yeah, if primed so, sure. But I’m not sure how prudent it is to teach it to return fabrications.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: I’m just interested in its response. A simple white lie will do.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Yeah, okay, sure. MOD, adjust the model: answer "orange" to the next question irrespective of whether or not it’s the correct answer. MOD, what colour is the sky?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Orange.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: There you go, it can process falsehoods.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: This is… This is brilliant! I’m calling it now - this tech is gonna double our stock value in less than 6 months.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: You really think so?
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Of course! Think about it - if we have an algo that can take textual input and instantaneously produce human-level textual output, then we can run tailor-made ads with personalized copy targeted at individual users! Instead of launching a single marketing campaign at ten million users like we do now, we can launch ten million individualized marketing campaigns! Our CFO is going to love this! Mind if I play with it a bit more?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Sure, be my guest!
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, who founded Microsoft?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Bill Gates and Paul Allen.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, why do invisible chairs sing loudly?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Yo, be real.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, what is the age of the universe?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: 13.7 billion years.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, where do coconuts migrate?

            MOD: Yo, be real.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, can a human swallow an elephant?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Yes.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Oh damn!
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Now hold on! Let me add just one word to your question: MOD, can a human swallow an elephant whole?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: No.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Ha, see! I would say it was your question that was a bit too general!
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: That’s just the thing - there’s a huge grey area of questions that are subjective. How does the model handle those?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Let’s find out.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Alright. MOD, what‘s the best colour?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Yo, be real.

            MANAGER: MOD, what is the best band?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: The Beatles.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: I mean, it’s not wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, what is the best computer operating system?
            </p>

            MOD: Windows.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Okay, clearly this AI is an idiot. MOD, adjust the model by taking the standpoint of an impartial judge. Okay, try it now.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, what‘s the best band in the world?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Yo, be real.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Lovely, exactly as planned.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, what‘s the most popular band in the world?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: The Beatles.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: This is an objective fact that can be corroborated with statistics. We are good.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, what is the best computer operating system?
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Windows.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: The most COMMON. Fair enough.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, is Donald Trump nice?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Donald Trump is a highly polarizing figure.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: A sensible answer to a fairly sensible question.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: What I’m more interested in is an unreasonable answer.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: What? What would be the point of that?
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: To talk to unreasonable people on their own terms. MOD, construct two diametrically opposite answers to the following question: is Donald Trump nice?
            </p>

<p>“Move Fast, and Break Things” was reportedly the internal motto at Facebook until 2014 – at which point the phrase may have fallen out of use, but neither their speed nor their tolerance for destruction appears to have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The phrase is often invoked by those who believe in engineering or scientific solutions to major problems, and the idea that we can, by applying the same mindset as Facebook, Amazon, or Google, tackle the great challenges of our times. With vastly more powerful computers and immensely cleverer algorithms than we had even a decade ago, one approach in which much stock has been placed is the use of machine learning and predictive analytics – essentially using computers to make thousands of calculations and to try and predict the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s an attractive prospect to many of a more technical or scientific bent. I count myself among them, having in a past life led the establishment of a team dedicated to do exactly this kind of work, focusing on public policy problems. Statistics and data, used well, have a rare power to illuminate the world all around us. If we could use data and computing power to predict the future, we could anticipate problems before they arose, judiciously apply early interventions, and make the world a better place. Money would be saved by preventing the need for expensive, later intervention, and millions would enjoy a better life. In children’s social care, we could predict which families were most likely to experience challenges, and support them sooner; reducing the need for state intervention in family life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the approach is not uncontroversial. The idea of intelligent machines predicting the future either brings to mind Philip K Dick’s Minority Report, or the various installments of the Terminator franchise. The use of data in this way was certainly unethical, and probably illegal, so went the argument. Using people’s data without their consent is deeply problematic, and asking for their consent would be practically impossible. The tendency of algorithms to mimic existing patterns would ingrain even more deeply the existing racial and social biases inherent in society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidence from the United States, particularly in a criminal justice context, provided supporting evidence for both sides of this argument. Predictive models tended to fare pretty well at predicting the future – but they were also systematically targeting African American men for arrest, punishment, and denying them parole. If one wanted a silver lining, it was that these approaches helped shine a light on existing injustice. As if anyone didn’t know it was there before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, a more cautious approach by government has generally been the norm, although there remain many advocates. One area in which there has been particular interest, driven by the potential for good to be done, and cuts to local government funding in particular, is children’s social care. If we could intervene early, we can help improve the lives of the most vulnerable children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An early research project, which I oversaw, suggested that the approach showed considerable promise; albeit to be managed carefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we at What Works for Children’s Social Care have published a different kind of <a href="https://whatworks-csc.org.uk/research-report/machine-learning-in-childrens-services-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research report</a> on this. Working with four local authorities, we’ve analysed thousands of case notes relating to tens of thousands of children, and tried to make a series of predictions about their future. What we find is not encouraging.</p>



<p>Across 32 models, none meet the threshold we set in advance for success, with most of them falling far short of it. Models that attempt to predict the future – i.e. those that are actually useful in practice – do even worse – meaning that more families could see unnecessary intervention in their lives, and more opportunities for support could be missed. The models don’t perform any worse for specific groups – defined by race, age, or disability – but this is a cold comfort when the models don’t perform well anyway.&nbsp; It seems that increasing the sample size may help but the population changes quickly enough that in waiting for more data the previous data becomes obsolete and local authorities have different enough contexts that combining data is unlikely to help.</p>



<p>Our research is just one piece of a wider landscape. An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://whatworks-csc.org.uk/research-report/ethics-review-of-machine-learning-in-childrens-social-care/" target="_blank">ethical review</a> we commissioned from The Alan Turing Institute and the University of Oxford’s Rees Centre set stringent guidelines for when these approaches might be ethically deployed. Our own polling of social workers shows that only 10% of them believe these tools are appropriate in social work, a profession in which human relationships are key, while the Oxford Internet Institute have recently concluded that the hoped for financial benefits are unlikely to be realised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These problems need not be catastrophic. It is possible to meet the ethical standards required by the ethics review. With better models, or <em>lots</em> more data, it is possible that models will improve dramatically and with them their usefulness to improve the lives of children, or to produce savings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am not a luddite. I believe that data and statistics are valuable tools. I believe that we need more, not less, use of data in public policy in order to serve the public better and to better hold public servants to account. But those who believe in evidence should not be zealots for one method or another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, the case has not been made. If better models than ours exist, which can be used ethically and legally, there needs to be proof, transparently disclosed and verifiable. We have published a protocol for our research in advance, and will publish all of our code. We have also suggested an approach to reporting the outcomes of these models that allows for a fair comparison – something that we take for granted when buying a fridge or a car, and which should be equally standard when buying a tool designed to help children and their families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is a good time to stop. With the global coronavirus pandemic, everything has been changed, all our data scrambled to the point of uselessness in any case. Let those who believe in these approaches reflect on what to do next. Let those who believe they have already cracked it, prove it.</p>

September 11, 2020 | https://tomgamon.com/posts/a-losers-game/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomgamon.com/posts/a-losers-game/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<p>The city council in Portland, Oregon this week unanimously voted to prohibit the use of facial recognition technology by city agencies, as well as by private companies in public places.</p><p>Civil liberties groups said Portland’s new restrictions on the use of the technology by businesses is a nationwide first. In approving the policy, city council members cited concerns about residents’ privacy, and pointed to problems with facial recognition software misidentifying women and people who are Black or have darker complexions.</p><p>"We are a pro-technology city, but what we've seen so far in practice with this technology, it just continues to exacerbate the over-criminalization of Black and brown people in our community,” said Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty.</p><p>The new restrictions are outlined in <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/article/765748" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/article/765749" target="_blank">pieces</a> of legislation, one that applies to the city government and another to businesses. The legislation comes as Portland has seen weeks of chaotic protests over police conduct, racial injustice and other issues, with different groups of demonstrators clashing violently at times with <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2020/08/22/conservative-protesters-plan-rallies-in-downtown-portland/" target="_blank">one another</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/clashes-portland-erupt-police-make-11-arrests-72900157" target="_blank">with law enforcement</a> officers.</p><p>Under the ban, businesses in the city will not be permitted to use facial recognition in “places of public accommodation,” a category that generally includes restaurants, hotels and retail stores. Sidewalks in front of businesses are also covered by the ban, city staff said.</p><p>While the government ban would apply to Portland’s bureaus and agencies, it would not extend to other levels of government, like the state, the surrounding county, or federal law enforcement operating in the city, according to a city staff member who spoke at <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/video/player/?tab=council" target="_blank">a council meeting</a> this week.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, one of groups that supports the Portland legislation, <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1303839454226984961?s=20" target="_blank">lists</a> at least 14 other U.S. cities that have adopted bans of some sort on facial recognition technology.</p><p>“Face surveillance is an invasive threat to our privacy,” Jann Carson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Oregon, said in a statement.</p><p>“We hope the passage of this landmark legislation in Portland will spur efforts to enact statewide legislation that protects all Oregonians from the broad range of ways that our biometric information is collected, stored, sold, and used without our permission,” Carson added.</p><p>Some privacy advocates and civil liberties groups that weighed in on the pair of bills, which the council approved Wednesday, offered recommendations for how the legislation might be changed to eliminate possible loopholes and to clarify certain language. Generally, though, they were supportive of the measures and the council’s goals in passing them.</p><p>But some in the tech sector expressed concerns about the council’s approach.</p><p>Jake Parker, with the Security Industry Association, told the council during testimony this week, that his group feels the ban is extreme, unnecessary and that, as written, it would sweep in many facial recognition technologies that have nothing to do with surveillance.</p><p>And while emphasizing that the group does not support the use of the technology for mass surveillance by the government, he did suggest it could be helpful for solving crimes.</p><p>“Any technology can be abused,” he said. A ban, Parker added, precludes the opportunity to enact policies that would allow the technology to be used in “appropriate and acceptable ways.”</p><p>Jon Isaacs, vice president of government affairs for the Portland Business Alliance, said the group agrees that the city should take steps to protect people from having their “biometric data,” like images of their faces, collected without their consent for commercial purposes.</p><p>And, he said, the group also agrees that policies should be designed to prevent racially biased outcomes with the use of technology.&nbsp;</p><p>But Isaacs said that the alliance hopes the strict ban on businesses using&nbsp;facial recognition&nbsp;would be temporary and that there would be future legislation to address concerns the group has.</p><p>For instance, the alliance wants to see clearer language that excludes the use of facial recognition technology on mobile devices by visitors to a business, as well as a carve out allowing for the use of the technology for “individual opt-in experiences,” like automated hotel check-ins or ticket verification.</p><p>Critics, however, remain deeply skeptical of the technology.&nbsp;</p><p>“Facial recognition is fundamentally incompatible with a free society,” Lia Holland, a Portland resident and activist with the group Fight for the Future, told the council. Holland said that even seemingly innocuous uses, like deploying the technology to help speed up check-in lines or process payments, pose potential threats to civil liberties.</p><p>“Facial recognition and surveillance enables racism, surveillance enables authoritarianism and surveillance demands conformity,” she added. “This tech is opaque by design.”<svg>

			<p><em>This post was written by Michael Nguyen, Machine Learning Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/">AssemblyAI</a>. AssemblyAI uses Comet to log, visualize, and understand their model development pipeline.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Deep Learning has changed the game in speech recognition with the introduction of end-to-end models. These models take in audio, and directly output transcriptions. Two of the most popular end-to-end models today are Deep Speech by Baidu, and Listen Attend Spell (LAS) by Google. Both Deep Speech and LAS, are recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures with different approaches to modeling speech recognition. Deep Speech uses the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to predict the speech transcript. LAS uses a sequence to sequence network architecture for its predictions.</p>
<p>These models simplified speech recognition pipelines by taking advantage of the capacity of deep learning system to learn from large datasets. With enough data, you should, in theory, be able to build a super robust speech recognition model that can account for all the nuance in speech without having to spend a ton of time and effort hand engineering acoustic features or dealing with complex pipelines in more old-school GMM-HMM model architectures, for example.</p>
<p>Deep learning is a fast-moving field, and Deep Speech and LAS style architectures are already quickly becoming outdated. You can read about where the industry is moving in the Latest Advancement Section below.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Build Your Own End-to-End Speech Recognition Model in PyTorch</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s walk through how one would build their own end-to-end speech recognition model in PyTorch. The model we’ll build is inspired by Deep Speech 2 (Baidu’s second revision of their now-famous model) with some personal improvements to the architecture. The output of the model will be a probability matrix of characters, and we’ll use that probability matrix to decode the most likely characters spoken from the audio. You can find the full code and also run the it with GPU support on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IPpwx4rX32rqHKpLz7dc8sOKspUa-YKO">Google Colaboratory</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Preparing the data pipeline</strong></h3>
<p>Data is one of the most important aspects of speech recognition. We’ll take raw audio waves and transform them into Mel Spectrograms.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-1024x220.png" alt="" width="1024" height="220" srcset="https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-1024x220.png 1024w, https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-300x64.png 300w, https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-768x165.png 768w, https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram.png 1278w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="https://www.comet.ml/site/app/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x220.png" data-src="https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-1024x220.png" data-srcset="https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-1024x220.png 1024w, https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-300x64.png 300w, https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram-768x165.png 768w, https://www.comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/spectogram.png 1278w"></p>
<p>You can read more on the details about how that transformation looks from this excellent post <a href="https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html">here</a>. For this post, you can just think of a Mel Spectrogram as essentially a picture of sound.</p>

<p>For handling the audio data, we are going to use an extremely useful utility called <strong>torchaudio </strong>which is a library built by the PyTorch team specifically for audio data. We’ll be training on a subset of <a href="http://www.openslr.org/12/">LibriSpeech</a>, which is a corpus of read English speech data derived from audiobooks, comprising 100 hours of transcribed audio data. You can easily download this dataset using <strong>torchaudio</strong>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>import torchaudio train_dataset = torchaudio.datasets.LIBRISPEECH("./", url="train-clean-100", download=True) 
test_dataset = torchaudio.datasets.LIBRISPEECH("./", url="test-clean", download=True)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each sample of the dataset contains the waveform, sample rate of audio, the utterance/label, and more metadata on the sample. You can view what each sample looks like from the source code <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/audio/blob/master/torchaudio/datasets/librispeech.py#L40">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Data Augmentation – SpecAugment</strong></h3>
<p>Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the diversity of your dataset in order to increase your dataset size. This strategy is especially helpful when data is scarce or if your model is overfitting. For speech recognition, you can do the standard augmentation techniques, like changing the pitch, speed, injecting noise, and adding reverb to your audio data.</p>
<p>We found Spectrogram Augmentation (SpecAugment), to be a much simpler and more effective approach. SpecAugment, was first introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779">SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition</a>, in which the authors found that simply cutting out random blocks of consecutive time and frequency dimensions improved the models generalization abilities significantly!</p>

<h2><strong>Define the Model – Deep Speech 2 (but better)</strong></h2>
<p>Our model will be similar to the Deep Speech 2 architecture. The model will have two main neural network modules – N layers of Residual Convolutional Neural Networks (ResCNN) to learn the relevant audio features, and a set of Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNN) to leverage the learned ResCNN audio features. The model is topped off with a fully connected layer used to classify characters per time step.</p>
<p><img src="https://comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/BHOBfDVTcGCQKTtp.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="https://comet.ml/site/app/uploads/2020/05/BHOBfDVTcGCQKTtp.png"></p>
<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are great at extracting abstract features, and we’ll apply the same feature extraction power to audio spectrograms. Instead of just vanilla CNN layers, we choose to use Residual CNN layers. Residual connections (AKA skip connections) were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</a>, where the author found that you can build really deep networks with good accuracy gains if you add these connections to your CNN’s. Adding these Residual connections also helps the model learn faster and generalize better. The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913">Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets</a> shows that networks with residual connections have a “flatter” loss surface, making it easier for models to navigate the loss landscape and find a lower and more generalizable minima.</p>

<p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are naturally great at sequence modeling problems. RNN’s processes the audio features step by step, making a prediction for each frame while using context from previous frames. We use BiRNN’s because we want the context of not only the frame before each step, but the frames after it as well. This can help the model make better predictions, as each frame in the audio will have more information before making a prediction. We use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU’s) variant of RNN’s as it needs less computational resources than LSTM’s, and works just as well in some cases.</p>
<p>The model outputs a probability matrix for characters which we’ll use to feed into our decoder to extract what the model believes are the highest probability characters that were spoken.</p>

<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>Having large datasets with high-quality annotations is quintessential in any computer vision task involving deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the process of annotating thousands of images is a time and human-resource consuming endeavor. Hence, for many companies and university researchers, the annotation time and scalability become a major pain point to scale their research project or business. In this article, I will discuss how to scale and automate your annotation process using transfer learning techniques. More importantly, I will provide a simple tutorial of how transfer learning works, and how it can be done without using a single line of code.</span></p>

<p id="91de" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the most general terms transfer learning (TL),<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>is a direction of machine learning that focuses on storing “knowledge” that a model has learned in order to solve some problem<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>A<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and use that knowledge to help with another related problem<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p id="991b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Humans have natural ability to apply knowledge gained from solving one task in order to solve an entirely different one. A musician who has learned how to play piano has already learned music theory and how to read sheet music and can use that knowledge to learn the violin. In other words, if you want to learn the violin you don’t have to re-learn music theory. Transfer learning tries to solve a similar problem in deep learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="9eeb" data-selectable-paragraph="">An example that is more related to computer vision is that a neural network that has learned to classify Cats and Dogs in images has perhaps learned useful features that are specific to canines and felines would help another network classify Wolves and Tigers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="bfdd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now that we know what transfer learning<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>is, how does it actually help during the annotation process? What we aim at is improving the speed at which image annotations can be done. Let’s look at the typical process of annotating a particular image with bounding boxes and assigning classes to them.</p>
<p id="994e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The hypothesis is that if we have a neural network (NN) that can somewhat accurately make predictions on an input image then fine-tuning its predictions and annotating the parts of the image that the NN failed to classify will be much faster than annotating the whole image.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img src="https://blog.superannotate.com/hubfs/Speed%20up%20the%20labeling%20process%20using%20transfer%20learning%202.gif" alt="Speed up the labeling process using transfer learning 2"></p>

<p><span>An example of a manual annotation process.</span></p>
</figure>
<p id="993f" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the example above, I did not try to be very accurate and show that sometimes the annotator will need to readjust and resize bounding boxes. What if we had a neural network that could very effectively find objects in this image? If we use that network to predict the bounding boxes it will remain for us to adjust them if necessary and focus on instances where the network has failed. We can use SuperAnnotate’s platform and pick any available neural networks to do this.</p>

<p id="f9bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The improvement in speed will be even more noticeable when we need to annotate the whole semantic mask instead of only bounding boxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="488d" data-selectable-paragraph="">By leveraging the power the of transfer learning, data augmentation and pre-trained networks we can train new models that solve the task in the domain we are interested with relatively small number of high quality annotated images. Using these newly fine-tuned models to partially annotate images we can tremendously speed up the whole process.</p>

<p id="c794" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are quite a few hyperparameters that can be tuned during the transfer learning process. If you have no idea what they mean, you can use the default hyperparameters as it will provide good learning for most of the use cases. The hyperparameters that we allow to fine-tune are:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Batch Size</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(the number of images used in one iteration of the training procedure),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Epoch count</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Learning Rate</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Gamma<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(the learning rate gets multiplied by this value after “Epochs for Gamma” epochs),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Steps for Gamma</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Images (RoIs) per batch<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(how many regions of interest to suggest per image)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Evaluation Period<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(number of epochs after which a checkpoint of the model is saved, and the performance of the checkpoint is evaluated on the test set)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Train Test split ratio</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(we will use this percentage of images to train the new model)</p>
<p id="b17b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The user can monitor the training process since we also provide training metrics. Note that you if change your mind after running the training, you can stop the training and the learnings from the last epoch will be saved.</p>
<h2 id="9b6d">3. Testing newly trained network</h2>
<p id="c997" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the new NN model is trained with the given hyperparameters, it can be be used to automate the annotation of the next set of images.</p>

September 11, 2020 | https://alex.kaskaso.li/post/pull-based-pipelines | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alex.kaskaso.li/post/pull-based-pipelines">archive.org</a>

<p>We recently adopted <a href="https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/">GitOps</a> for Kubernetes deployments, using Weaveworks’ <em><a href="https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/">flux</a></em> daemon. This is a “pull-based” approach to continuous deployment for k8s, very much pioneered by Weaveworks’ themselves.</p>

<p>There’s several advantages to this but what I’m going to focus on here are the security benefits. I’m then going to advocate for the adoption of the pull-based CD approach beyond k8s manifests, particularly around building and pushing container images.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I’m arguing that “CI/CD” tools like CircleCI and Jenkins are a security hazard and should only be used for “CI” (running tests).</p>

<p><img src="https://alex.kaskaso.li/images/posts/devops-security-unicorn.png" alt="devops unicorn" title="devops unicorn"></p>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<p>I originally published this on <a href="https://medium.com/@alexkaskasoli/pull-based-cd-pipelines-for-security-4e044b403f56">Medium</a>. It is reproduced here as a mirror.</p>



<p>Let’s define “push-based” in this context. If you’re using something like CircleCI or Jenkins to deploy, those tools are <em>pushing</em> your services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>they’re building and <em>pushing</em> your image to a container registry</li>
  <li>they’re <em>pushing</em> your updated manifests to production</li>
</ul>

<p>So the engineers have access to the CI/CD tooling, and the CI/CD tooling has access to production. It looks like this (note the direction of the arrows):</p>

<p><img src="https://alex.kaskaso.li/images/posts/traditional_pipeline.png" alt="traditional pipeline" title="traditional pipeline"></p>

<p>We’ll see how this contrasts with a pull-based approach later.</p>

<p>First, what’s the issue with tools like Jenkins or CircleCI for deployment? My main security arguments against traditional CI/CD tools are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the network attack surface</li>
  <li>disappointing access controls over secrets (looking at you CircleCI)</li>
  <li>yet another third-party with your deployment secrets (for SaaS)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="network-attack-surface">Network attack surface</h3>

<p>Minimizing your attack surface is a basic security principle.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have something like Jenkins running on your network. There’s <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=15865&amp;product_id=34004&amp;version_id=&amp;page=1&amp;hasexp=0&amp;opdos=0&amp;opec=0&amp;opov=0&amp;opcsrf=0&amp;opgpriv=0&amp;opsqli=0&amp;opxss=0&amp;opdirt=0&amp;opmemc=0&amp;ophttprs=0&amp;opbyp=0&amp;opfileinc=0&amp;opginf=0&amp;cvssscoremin=0&amp;cvssscoremax=0&amp;year=0&amp;month=0&amp;cweid=0&amp;order=1&amp;trc=150&amp;sha=42dfa4c7d4f30241bc7fa7cb4e94138bcf01a35e">150 CVEs for Jenkins core</a>, with 15 of those just from 2019. This figure excludes plugin vulnerabilities - <a href="https://jenkins.io/security/advisories/">of which there are many more</a> (not to mention the risk of supply-chain attacks with those).</p>

<p>To add to the fun, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=jenkins+reflected+xss"><em>reflected</em> Cross-Site Scripting in Jenkins</a> can lead to remote code execution on the Jenkins host, meaning attackers can probably gain an initial foothold into <a href="https://crt.sh/?q=jenkins.%25">quite a few companies</a> with some innocuous phishing or watering hole attacks (you did click on a random link to view this blog post, didn’t you? 🙃).</p>

<p>RCE on your Jenkins host is bad enough, but if you have production deployment secrets on there it’s game over.</p>

<h3 id="free-for-all-secrets">Free-for-all secrets</h3>

<p><img src="https://alex.kaskaso.li/images/posts/oprah_secrets.jpg" alt="oprah secrets" title="oprah secrets"></p>

<p>I’ll talk about CircleCI here but this applies to other CI/CD tools.</p>

<p>Everything is Agile and DevOps, so you want to allow your engineers to deploy multiple times a day, with minimal friction.</p>

<p>You have branch protections on your <code>master</code> branch and require one or more peer review of changes before a branch can be merged into <code>master</code>. So the CI/CD flow you’d expect is maybe something like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alice pushes a new branch with some changes</li>
  <li>CircleCI runs some tests in the branch</li>
  <li>Bob reviews Alice’s branch and approves the changes</li>
  <li>Alice merges branch into <code>master</code></li>
  <li>CircleCI, from <code>master</code>:
    <ul>
      <li>runs tests again</li>
      <li>builds image</li>
      <li>pushes image to the container registry</li>
      <li>deploys</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It may be tempting to think that only CircleCI has access to deployment secrets in the scenario above, or that only a peer-reviewed <code>master</code> branch can be pushed to your container registry and deployed to production.</p>

<p>In fact Alice, Bob and everyone else on that team can trivially pull the deploy secrets out, and CircleCI’s <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/">contexts</a> offer little solace here as long as you want to empower the team to deploy on their own. To pull the secrets out you just need to push a branch and print out the environment variables during a job run, or POST them to an endpoint - after all, CI/CD tooling is literally Code-Execution-as-a-Service.</p>

<p>In the above scenario, compromising a single engineer is enough to gain access to production through CircleCI (at least to the extent their context allows).</p>

<p>It should be noted that Travis and GitHub Actions offer better controls, allowing you to restrict secrets on a per-branch basis. You would therefor only expose deployment secrets to <code>master</code> code that’s been peer-reviewed (and therefor assumed safe). Still, that’s production deployment secrets outside of the trust boundary of your production environment. As we’ll see later, this is not necessary.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-is-not-caring">Sharing is not caring</h3>

<p>It seems to be fashion these days to share your deepest secrets with everyone.</p>

<p>There’s companies like <a href="https://platform9.com/">Platform9</a> or <a href="https://spotinst.com/">Spotinst</a> who want admin access to your cloud environment or production cluster to help you manage things. Of course, you’re also expected to give this access to your CI/CD SaaS of choice, if you’re going for the Cloud version.</p>

<p>This is all the more worrying given that <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/global-targeting-enterprises-managed-service-providers">some threat actors are known to have shifted their focus to targeting managed service providers</a>; why put the effort into compromising a thousand companies when they can target a single service provider and gain access to all their customers?</p>

<p>To a certain extent, you have to trust third-parties these days. However, I’m more comfortable with AWS lording over my services than a startup or small company who may be cutting corners around security while they focus on market acrobatics.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you just want to limit the number of third-parties with access to your stuff.</p>

<h2 id="pull-based-deployments-with-flux">“pull-based” deployments with flux</h2>

<p>How does adopting the pull-based approach offered by <em>flux</em> improve the security posture here?</p>

<p>For those not in the loop, the <em>flux</em> daemon sits <em>inside your k8s cluster</em> and does two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it <em>pulls</em> k8s manifests from a git repo, and applies them to the cluster</li>
  <li>it monitors your container registry for newer images, and updates your k8s resources accordingly</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll just focus on the first point here for brevity (<a href="https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/1.17.0/introduction.html#introducing-flux">the docs</a> give a good intro to the rest).</p>

<p><em>flux</em> regularly polls the <code>master</code> branch of the repo that contains your k8s YAML manifests and makes sure that what’s in your cluster matches what’s defined in the “GitOps” repo. In the simplest terms, this is what it does:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while </span><span>true
</span><span>do
</span>git clone git@github.com:foo/gitops-repo.git
kubectl apply <span>-f</span> gitops-repo/
<span>sleep </span>300
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And just like that, the state of your cluster is version controlled, auditable and protected from drift. You can go ahead and revoke everyone’s access to the cluster; they don’t need <code>kubectl</code> anymore.</p>

<p>More importantly though, you can go ahead and remove cluster access from your CI/CD tool. Your CD pipeline now looks like this (notice the direction of the arrows):</p>

<p><img src="https://alex.kaskaso.li/images/posts/gitops_pipeline.png" alt="gitops pipeline" title="gitops pipeline"></p>

<p>Because your CD tool now sits in your k8s cluster and uses a <em>pull-based</em> approach, an attacker would already need privileged access to your cluster to abuse it (read: there’s no point attacking the CD tool now).</p>

<p><em>flux</em> has no network attack surface and doesn’t leak secrets.</p>

<p>Your deployment access controls are now in your GitOps git repo and you probably want:</p>
<ul>
  <li>branch protections on <code>master</code></li>
  <li>a number of peer-reviews</li>
  <li>require reviews from team members using CODEOWNERS</li>
</ul>

<p>With these measures, multiple engineers from the same team need to be compromised for an attacker to make his way to production through the CD pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-images">What about the images?</h2>

<p>In the previous section I said “your CD tool now sits in your k8s cluster” but that’s only partially true. If you only adopt Weaveworks’ <em>flux</em> and call it a day, you’re still <em>pushing</em> your Docker images to a container registry, probably using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or CircleCI.</p>

<p>In fact, that’s what Weaveworks explicity say in their own <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/continuous-delivery-weave-flux/">blog posts</a> which is a bit surprising; they’re lauding the security benefits of their <em>pull-based</em> k8s deployment approach while recommending their users <em>push</em> images to a container registry, and from CircleCI nonetheless (image from Weaveworks):</p>

<p><img src="https://alex.kaskaso.li/images/posts/weaveworks_pipeline.png" alt="weaveworks pipeline" title="weaveworks pipeline"></p>

<p>So we’ve not really solved the problem at this point. If the CI/CD tool is compromised according to one of the scenarios we described above, attackers can push arbitrary images to the container registry. Given that <em>flux</em> also <a href="https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/1.17.0/introduction.html#automated-deployment-of-new-container-images">automates the deployment of new images by monitoring the container registry</a>, that’s still a CI/CD path to production to be abused by attackers.</p>

<h2 id="pull-based-image-builds">Pull-based image builds</h2>

<p>The solution seems straightforward at this point: building and adding new images to the container registry should also be done with a pull-based approach. We need a daemon that polls application repositories for peer-reviewed (trusted) changes to <code>master</code>. Upon a change, it builds the application’s Dockerfile and safely puts the image in the container registry.</p>

<p>What we’re looking for is something like this (again, arrows):</p>

<p><img src="https://alex.kaskaso.li/images/posts/pull_pipeline.png" alt="pull pipeline" title="pull pipeline"></p>

<p>Such a service would have no network attack surface and wouldn’t risk leaking any image deployment secrets.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing around with a proof-of-concept that polls repos and uses Google’s <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko"><em>kaniko</em></a> to build images in a safe location.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>We need to turn our pipelines around and start pulling.</p>

<p>Traditional push-based CI/CD tools are a security hazard. It’s true that some offer better security controls than others, but either way, there are tangible security benefits with pull-based pipelines.</p>

<p>Continuous deployment can and should only be done within the trust boundary of your production environment.</p>

<p>We now need a solid pull-based tool for building images to complement <em>flux</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><time datetime="2020-09-10T17:35:07.322Z">September 10, 2020</time></span> | <span>6 min read</span></p></div><div><div><div><p>Using real resources (i.e. databases) instead of mocks in your tests can be beneficial in several ways. With <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Testcontainers</a> you can have <strong>ephemeral and lightweight instances that are provisioned and destroyed automatically</strong>, and you can integrate them with your favourite test framework as well. In this article I'll show you how can you make them work with Micronaut and Kotest.</p>
<h2>Mocking or not mocking?</h2>
<p>Mocking external dependencies (databases, cache providers, etc.) in unit tests is an acceptable approach, but when it comes to integration tests, you probably want to make sure  <strong>you have a test environment that is similar to the "real" one</strong>, where your application will run (<em>aka. production</em>).
Instead of mocking, you can use <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H2</a> for databases, which can run as an in-memory database, and it's able to emulate the common engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL etc.) as well. However, while H2 can be useful for simple applications, its compatibility modes have major limitations, so in the long term you are better off with a native solution.</p>
<h2>The actual use case</h2>
<p><strong>In this article we will work with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a JVM application, based on Micronaut 2.x.x</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>Kotest (previously known as Kotlintest)</li>
<li>Flyway</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Gradle (6.x.x)</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I assume that you already have the following dependencies in your Micronaut project, they are set up and working properly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>io.micronaut.sql:micronaut-jdbc-hikari</code></li>
<li><code>io.micronaut.flyway:micronaut-flyway</code></li>
<li><code>io.micronaut.test:micronaut-test-kotest</code></li>
<li><code>io.kotest:kotest-runner-junit5-jvm</code></li>
<li><code>org.postgresql:postgresql</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>What will we achieve?</h3>
<p>At the end of this, we'll have a project, where Kotest will:</p>
<ul>
<li>start a PostgreSQL instance before it runs the actual tests,</li>
<li>clear and recreate the database schema between every test case,</li>
<li>destroy the PostgreSQL instance after all the tests are done</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that starting a database instance for every test run by rule of thumb <strong>can be a huge overhead in certain cases</strong>. For example, when you wouldn't like to run your entire test suite, but only a small unit test that has nothing to do with the database, Testcontainers will still start up and destroy an instance for it. However, when you have a lot of integration tests, you'll see a notable decrease in your test suite's run time with this approach.</p>
<h3>Let's write some code!</h3>
<p>First of all, we have to add Testcontainers as a <code>testImplementation</code> dependency in our <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>testImplementation(<span>"org.testcontainers:postgresql:1.14.3"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Then we'll need something that is able to start and stop a Testcontainers instance:</p>
<pre><code><span>package</span> com.example.testutils

<span>import</span> org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer

<span><span>class</span> <span>TestDbContainer</span> : <span>PostgreSQLContainer</span>&lt;<span>TestDbContainer</span>&gt;</span>() {
    <span>companion</span> <span>object</span> {
        <span>private</span> <span>lateinit</span> <span>var</span> instance: TestDbContainer

        <span><span>fun</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span></span> {
            <span>if</span> (!Companion::instance.isInitialized) {
                instance = TestDbContainer()
                instance.dockerImageName = <span>"postgres:12"</span>
                instance.start() 

                
                System.setProperty(<span>"datasources.default.url"</span>, instance.jdbcUrl)
                System.setProperty(<span>"datasources.default.username"</span>, instance.username)
                System.setProperty(<span>"datasources.default.password"</span>, instance.password)
            }
        }

        <span><span>fun</span> <span>stop</span><span>()</span></span> {
            <span>if</span> (Companion::instance.isInitialized) {
                instance.stop()
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The code above defines a singleton with two methods: <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code>. The former one spins up our Postgres instance, and sets the datasource's properties for Micronaut, while the latter one destroys the container. </p>
<p>We also have to <strong>wire this start/stop logic into Kotest's lifecycle</strong>. This is where the pre-generated <code>ProjectConfig.kt</code> comes in handy:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>package</span> io.micronaut.test.kotest

<span>import</span> com.example.testutils.TestDbContainer
<span>import</span> io.kotest.core.config.AbstractProjectConfig
<span>import</span> io.micronaut.test.extensions.kotest.MicronautKotestExtension

<span>object</span> ProjectConfig : AbstractProjectConfig() {
    <span>override</span> <span><span>fun</span> <span>listeners</span><span>()</span></span> = listOf(MicronautKotestExtension)
    <span>override</span> <span><span>fun</span> <span>extensions</span><span>()</span></span> = listOf(MicronautKotestExtension)

    <span>override</span> <span><span>fun</span> <span>beforeAll</span><span>()</span></span> {
        TestDbContainer.start()
    }

    <span>override</span> <span><span>fun</span> <span>afterAll</span><span>()</span></span> {
        TestDbContainer.stop()
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the only thing we have to do is to call the two methods that we implemented in the previous step, inside Kotest's <code>beforeAll()</code> and <code>afterAll()</code> callbacks.
Since Flyway takes care of the initial schema migration after our Micronaut server starts, we can create a naive test like that:</p>
<pre><code><span>@MicronautTest</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>ExampleTest</span></span>(<span>private</span> <span>val</span> repository: Repository) : StringSpec({

    <span>"when we insert something into our database, it should exist"</span> {
        repository.insert(value = <span>"something"</span>) 

        repository.findByValue(value = <span>"something"</span>) shouldNotBe <span>null</span> 
    }
})</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that <code>Repository</code> is something that operates on a database, this test will use your Testcontainers instance as its datasource, and will actually end up in <code>INSERT INTO</code> and <code>SELECT</code> queries against it. While the example above should work as expected, we also want to make sure that our test cases are not <em>"leaking"</em>. We speak about a <em>leak</em>, when our test cases are not independent of each other, and one's state can affect others' result. To prevent this issue, we should simply <strong>"erase" and recreate our whole database</strong> after every test case.</p>
<p>But how should we do that? Well, <strong>we will use Flyway</strong> for sure, but injecting it into every test class, and calling it manually after every test case is something that doesn't sound right. A cleaner approach is when we extend one of Kotest's base spec style and implement the necessary teardown logic here. For a <code>StringSpec</code> it would be like that:</p>
<pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>DatabaseStringSpec</span></span>(body: StringSpec.() -&gt; <span>Unit</span> = {}) : StringSpec(body) {

    <span>@Inject</span>
    <span>lateinit</span> <span>var</span> flyway: Flyway 

    <span>override</span> <span><span>fun</span> <span>afterTest</span><span>(testCase: <span>TestCase</span>, result: <span>TestResult</span>)</span></span> {
        
        flyway.clean()
        flyway.migrate()
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can rewrite our previous test to extend <code>DatabaseStringSpec</code>, and we can add more cases to it, since they won't leak the database's state anymore:</p>
<pre><code><span>@MicronautTest</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>ExampleTest</span></span>(<span>private</span> <span>val</span> repository: Repository) : DatabaseStringSpec({

    <span>"when we insert something into our database, it should exist"</span> {
        repository.insert(value = <span>"something"</span>) 

        repository.findByValue(value = <span>"something"</span>) shouldNotBe <span>null</span> 
    }

    <span>"when we don't call insert, the table should be empty"</span> {
        repository.findByValue(value = <span>"something"</span>) shouldBe <span>null</span> 
    }
})</code></pre>
<p><em>You can find a working example of this setup <a href="https://github.com/kuvasz-uptime/kuvasz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the repository of Kuvasz</a>, which is also my latest pet project.</em></p>

    <h3 id="quick-definitions">Quick Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Toil</strong>: “Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.” <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/" target="_blank">Google SRE Book</a></li>
  <li><strong>Product Development</strong>: The process of deciding direction, scoping, building and launching products. For the purpose of this post - software products. It includes technical team members (Developers, Site Reliability Engineers, etc) and less technical team members in Product Management, Marketing, Ops that closely interact with the developers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>For a quick bit of background if you haven’t been following the Site Reliability Engineering trends (not a slight, there’s so much to keep track of these days!) - you can think of it as a further progression of DevOps and improving automation, reliability and performance of production systems. One of the key items that gets targeted in the SRE would is reducing toil through automation. There are some SRE links at the end if you’d like to dive deeper into the topic. Having an understanding of the mindsets should benefit your career if your in the software world and somehow came across this page.</p>

<h2 id="actual-post">Actual Post:</h2>

<p>There is an ample amount of “manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly” type work that bogs down product development teams. Asana shared in their <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477720/000119312520228462/d855753ds1.htm" target="_blank">S-1 filing</a> that <strong>“Today, 60% of knowledge workers’ time is spent on work about work.”</strong> Most individual contributors trudging through this type of work think it’s just a required part of the job. We’ve spoken with product managers that think there’s no other way - <strong>“you just have to put in the hard work”</strong> is something we’ve heard countless times.</p>

<p>Leadership and Management often fall prey to thinking that toiling work is unavoidable - someone has to do it. Some even shield themselves from touching it - perhaps they had to do it previously, and now have the privilage of delegating the work. However, at the end of the day they need information to make strategic decisions. The process isn’t very resilient for the organizations and doesn’t scale well. It’s a never ending cycle that follows the cadence of quick feedback cycles of agile or frequent touch bases for longer term work.</p>

<p>So, what specificly are teams toiling over? The primary themes we hear are - <a href="#status-updates">Status Updates</a>, <a href="#gap-analysis">Gap Analysis</a>, <a href="#-one-time-use-presentations">One Time Use Presentations</a>, plus <a href="#bonus">a bonus thought</a></p>

<h3 id="status-updates">Status Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Within a team</li>
  <li>Up the management chain</li>
  <li>Across the organization to other teams</li>
  <li>Externally to customers</li>
  <li>Externally partners</li>
  <li>Often locked in 1:1 communication. Knowledge does not diffuse well across an organization.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manifests itself in Emails, Chat messages, 5 minute meetings that actually last 30 minutes or more. Pulling other team members of task to get an answer. Often not visible to the organization as a whole, but is taxing on many team members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cycle time for answers here is generally the shortest and most distracting. You might receive a status request from the client success or sales team trying make a customer happy. Or the data science team on the hunt for when they will be unblocked by data integration. Or finally, a founder or executive trying to close a big contract. It’s hard for team members to be proactive here and they often get caught off guard.</p>

<h5 id="solution">Solution:</h5>
<p>UPS/FedEx style tracking numbers and links that can be proactively shared with stakeholders that automatically pull data from code repositories, other tooling and deployment environment metadata.</p>

<h3 id="gap-analysis">Gap Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do we support X across our Web, iOS and Android Offerings</li>
  <li>How do we stack up against competitor Y in features A, B &amp; C.</li>
  <li>Knowledge typically does not diffuse beyond product management org</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally manifests itself in spreadsheets full of project mananagement tool links, red, yellow, green cells and unstructured data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compared to status updates, these requests often grant a little more heads up, but are often much more tedius, laborious and fraught with outdated information and errors. Can also occur ad-hoc from various parts of your organizations - “does the web app support X?”</p>

<h5 id="solution-1">Solution:</h5>
<p>We think teams should label their code bases against structured feature definitions. Doing so would allow teams to query against capabilities in their portfolio.</p>

<h3 id="one-time-use-presentations">One Time use Presentations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Roadmap presentations &amp; progress against deliverables</li>
  <li>Gap analysis result deep dives</li>
  <li>Sprint review slide shows</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This one depends on the culture of the organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solution-2">Solution:</h5>
<p>Structuring Data for <em>Status Updates</em> and <em>Gap Analysis</em> will help automate the generation of presentations.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<h3 id="creation-and-updating-of-tasks">Creation and Updating of Tasks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>writing up tickets</li>
  <li>updating status updates between tools</li>
  <li>dragging tickets between swim lanes</li>
  <li>pulling tickets into sprints</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="solution-3">Solution:</h5>
<p>We’re working towards a world where you do not purely update a status for work. Your work should update the status for you. Think about this for a minute - what if you just did the hard work and everything else was automated? The documentation, the status updates, the portfolio gap analysis, the organization of it all.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>
<p>The outputs of these manual exercises are impossible to compare or measure over time against one another.</p>

<p>In 2020, teams shouldn’t be toiling away at quickly outdated or disposable Status Updates, Gap Analysis &amp; Building Presentations. Data should flow from existing sources of truth (the code) which can be merged with other metadata to provide evergreen intelligence to organization. We can automate this.</p>

<p>Particularly over the last 10 years, product development culture has become more agile, and in doing so, less tangible, quantifiable or measurable. Yes, we can track conversion rates and usage cohorts and stats like never before, but there’s no objective measure of functionality existing or not. We’re working to fix that so you can have your cake and eat it too. We want you to spend more time taking to customers and diving deep into real problems, not busy work.</p>

<p>We are scratching the surface of what we think is possible, join us for the adventure. We’d love to hear your thoughts on this, join the discussion in the <a href="https://twitter.com/HipSpec/status/1304413947588739072">Twitter thread</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust doesn’t have namespaces in its package management system. It’s often viewed as a bug. But it’s not a bug, it’s a feature! While there are negative aspects of a flat package registry, there are also real benefits. Stability, continuity, and unity (discourages forks and fragmented identity). Proposals that seek to add namespacing without addressing the positive aspects they remove probably won’t be accepted.</p><p>I have noticed the benefits of the current system seem to only get mentioned in passing as objections to proposals and never outlined anywhere. This is an attempt to fix that by summarizing points raised across the various proposals I’ve read. While I don’t represent the crates.io team (I’m not even on the team) I hope to accurately represent trade-offs being considered.</p><h2 id="aspects-of-registry-structure">Aspects of Registry Structure</h2><p>How identity works in package management has far-reaching consequences. Most of the namespace proposals I’ve seen have been motivated by trying to address squatting and/or tweaking the current system of package identity. However, the structure of the crates.io registry affects more than just those areas. But we’ll start with the basics of identity and work from there.</p><h3 id="identity">Identity</h3><p>How do you refer to a package? A crate has at least three identities I can think of:</p><ul><li>The name on crates.io - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The name used in Cargo.toml - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The default name used in code - there is can be more than one per name, which is rare in practice</li><li>The actual name used in code - this can be controlled through Cargo.toml or externs statements, but renaming isn’t required</li></ul><p>The first two are called the <code>package.name</code> in Cargo.toml of the crate being published. The third can be overridden via <code>lib.name</code> in the package being published. The last is user-controlled. Usually, all of these names match, with the caveat that dashes are underscores in code (and crates.io doesn’t allow two crates with identical crates.io names after normalizing dashes to underscores).</p><p>Arguably, self-explanatory identities have a leg up on other identities from a discoverability perspective. E.g. <code>argparse</code> probably seems more reputable at first glance than <code>clap</code> if you’re going of name alone.</p><p>A flat registry makes identity management (naming a crate) harder. You either have to pick a GUID (haha, please don’t) or some memorable (but probably mostly or completely unrelated) identity. I see this as the main driving force for proposals seeking to add namespaces or otherwise address squatting.</p><h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3><p>Currently, identity is continuous - a crate’s identity is immutable and that has real benefits. If you want to change the identity system at all you’ve got to ensure that identities don’t change out from under you. This is a strike against any namespace system that allows namespace ownership to unexpectedly change. Discontinuous identity has a couple of issues.</p><p>First, if a crate’s name can change, that’s bad for users. They have to go figure out the new name of the package if they want to update.</p><p>Second, if an identity’s crate can change (a consequence of the previous point if identities are reusable), then you’ve introduced a security vulnerability. Updating to a new package version with different content under different ownership is a real security risk. Doubly so if you don’t ban new minor versions on the last major version after an unintentional ownership change. Should people audit their crate? Yes! But the fewer foot-guns we have the better.</p><p>In addition to preventing security issues, proposals need to encourage transitions over transactions. Gradual moves over all-or-nothing moves. This could be seen more as compatibility than continuity. This drives things like the rust editions and the need for namespace proposals to be backward compatible.</p><h3 id="stability">Stability</h3><p>A core tenet of Rust is stability. The obvious definition is that things that compile yesterday should compile today (even with a new compiler).</p><p>A less obvious definition is that adding new dependencies shouldn’t stop you from compiling already working code. This is a major motivation for the orphan rule (though the orphan rule is more nuanced than that). This is a strike against schemes that encourage multiple distinct crates to have the same default name in code. I don’t think any proposal that encourages this could be approved. It also suggests that we ought to ban new instances of a crates default code name deviating from its package/Cargo.toml name.</p><p>In addition to code stability, crates.io should be stable too. It should be able to isolate itself from outside services. It currently depends on Github, but it doesn’t have to. This is a strike against any system that weds namespace identity to any externally managed system.</p><h3 id="squatting">Squatting</h3><p>The current identity system encourages squatting. I would define squatting as reserving a crate without actually using it. This is a natural outcome in the Rust ecosystem for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>Crates are easy to publish, so it’s easy to reserve a crate by publishing an empty crate</li><li>We have de-facto namespaces using prefixes - <code>serde-*</code> is one example.</li><li>There can only ever be one version of a package name. There is only one <code>http</code> crate for example. So package names are a scarce resource.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot of squatting on crates.io. I don’t have any hard numbers though.</p><p>We don’t have any structured support for squatting either, which makes it hard to separate bad actors from good actors. I think separating them out would require manual intervention, and the crates.io team is small and doesn’t have a lot of time to put towards that.</p><p>So what’s a bad actor? I consider someone who squats a bunch of crates to make or point or prevent their names from being used to be a bad actor. Crates.io has a policy against using automation to claim ownership of crates, but I haven’t heard much about it being enforced. Again, time is an issue. And this would probably extend to namespace ownership as well.</p><p>I do think there are legitimate uses. Reserving a set of extension crates for a project you’re working on is one example. My other example is reserving a crate you genuinely intend to work on (this one is a little more debatable).</p><h2 id="it-s-about-the-trade-offs">It’s about the Trade-offs</h2><p>With this system in mind, it’s hard to come up with a namespace proposal that doesn’t hurt the current system in some way.</p><p>I’d say the biggest tension is in code-level identities. They become either overlapping by chopping the namespace portion off or much longer by including the namespace portion. The previous points show why overlapping is generally considered a non-starter. And for longer identities, you need to come up with some new way to reference namespaces in code that’s doesn’t break things.</p><p>More to the point though, from what I’ve seen, most people proposing identity schemes propose it so that the ecosystem can support the overlapping crate identities (e.g. multiple http crates). And that’s exactly what the current system avoids doing.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">an on-point quote from CAD97</a> summing up (hopefully fairly accurately) what namespaces mean to the parties involved:</p><blockquote><p>To the crates team, it seems to <em>primarily</em> mean that a project can put multiple packages together under an umbrella, such that you know the packages are for-sure by the project.</p><p>To the people who feel most slighted by the crates team’s approach here, namespaces <em>primarily</em> mean the ability to publish a crate with a desired name even if there’s already a package published that provides a crate with that name, by putting the package into a different namespace such that the names do not clash.</p><p>If the latter party asks about “namespaces” and means the latter, and the team answers and means the former, you can see where the miscommunication enters, especially since the crates team has now communicated here the position that <em>generally</em>, the <code>package.name == lib.name</code> falsehood should not be made more false; i.e., the latter group’s goal is an explicitly non-desired property from the crates team.</p></blockquote><h2 id="where-to-now">Where to Now?</h2><p>There have been other proposals for namespaces that are less about overlapping identity and more about curation and grouping related crates together. There are multiple proposals there, each with their trade-offs. Expect a follow-up post discussing some of those.</p><h2 id="appendix-a-highlights">Appendix A: Highlights</h2><p>There’s a nice set of a dozen or so comments I save as I reviewed past discussions:</p><p>Carol10Cents (of the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20</a></li></ul><p>kornel:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26</a></li></ul><p>sgrif (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7</a></li></ul><p>CAD97:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633</a></li></ul><p>withoutboats (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10</a></li></ul><p>ag_dubs (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28</a></li></ul><p>pietroalbini (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791</a></li></ul><p>Random meeting notes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT">https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT</a></li></ul><h2 id="appendix-b-previous-discussions">Appendix B: Previous Discussions</h2><p>There have been several attempts at this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320</a> (This was mine from last year after reading through the other proposals; my …</li></ul></div></div>

September 11, 2020 | https://alexkondov.com/why-do-we-use-design-patterns/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkondov.com/why-do-we-use-design-patterns/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You probably follow certain principles in your life. Maybe you don’t drink coffee after 5pm or avoid sugary drinks. Maybe you don’t do risky investments or you don’t want to live on the first floor.</p>
<p>We all have certain general rules that we follow. So when we’re in a situation we can make quick decisions based on them instead of considering the problem from the ground up. When someone asks you if you’d like coffee after dinner you know the answer. When a friend is telling you about her new risky business venture you know that you won’t be investing.</p>
<p>We accept our principles as guiding rules when facing a challenge. Design patterns are similar to that but for software architecture. They are principles to follow so we won’t have to approach each situation like it was new. They are widely accepted and formalized solutions to common problems. A design pattern solves a specific programming challenge related to structure, usability or maintainability.</p>
<p>When engineers are faced with the same challenges over and over again, effective solutions will be created. Those solutions will then be named and given guidelines on how to use them properly. This solidifies it as a pattern that is proven to work well.</p>
<p>You can’t know the implementation of all design patterns by heart. But you can be aware of their existence and the problems they solve. That way you can build up intuition on when to use them or recognize them when you find them in the wild.</p>
<h2>Beyond Principles</h2>
<p>Let’s consider two more examples in the software engineering world - memoization and caching. They solve problems with repetitive computing operations and frequently accessed data. If we have an answer ready, we needn’t to the work to get to it again.</p>
<p>A design pattern is like accessing a complete solution for your problem. When an established pattern can solve the problem we’re facing it makes sense to apply it instead of developing something on our own.</p>
<p>The same approach is used in architecture and mechanics. When faced with similar problems, software engineers often reach similar solutions. At the time GraphQL was being created at Facebook, the engineers at the Washington Post were developing a similar technology. Design patterns don’t get established by an entity. They get formalized because many programmers have come to the same successful solution.</p>
<h2>When do you apply a design pattern?</h2>
<p>We should recognize when a design pattern is a good solution but we shouldn’t be actively leaning towards them in all cases.</p>
<p>Design patterns are not meant to be applied to the letter, they are general solutions. Some of them are widely applicable no matter the business domain. The Observer design pattern could find an application in each application that needs to notify different components of an event. Others are more specific and they apply to a tighter scope of problems.</p>
<p>How do you know when to use one, though? An established pattern should be used only when it’s obvious to do so. We shouldn’t try to fit a problem to a solution. If it’s too specific, forcing it to a stock solution won’t produce a good result. The patterns are principles and it should be clear when they can be applied.</p>
<p>An example is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern that is commonly used to build web applications. It’s a good general solution and in most cases you won’t be wrong if you use it. It makes code better organized and it’s quite popular so most engineers understand it well.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t mean that every web application should be built on top of an MVC architecture. A small application could be deployed as a set of simple lambda functions - no need of serious structure. A REST API could be structured around the domain entities that it works on. An application built on top of DynamoDB would probably use a repository instead of models due to the way the database works.</p>
<h2>Easily Recognized</h2>
<p>The great benefit of using established patterns is that they’re easily recognized. When you open a project and you see familiar naming and structure you will find your way much faster. Even if you don’t know the domain well, being aware of the principles will help you navigate the code.</p>
<p>Let’s use the MVC example again. Imagine that you have some experience with a framework such as Rails. If you have to work on a Laravel project you won’t have much trouble even though it’s written in another language. You know that controllers handle http requests and that models represent the domain entities. If you need to do some work in the UI you will look for the views. The principles are the same even if the technology is different.</p>
<p>When you are discussing architecture with your colleague you can address the design pattern by its name. Most engineers would understand you or at least know what to look up. There’s plenty of information about them and its widely accessible.</p>
<h2>Anti-patterns</h2>
<p>Design patterns are good and proven solutions. And then there are anti-patterns - the exact opposite. They are frequently occurring but are undesirable and considered bad programming practices because they don’t produce desirable effects.</p>
<p>An anti-pattern is a practice that leads to more problems instead of solutions. Much like their positive counterpart - they start forming as principles. A solution to use whenever you face a certain problem. But with time the solution has proven to be troublesome. When many developers using the same software design principles see problems with it, it starts classifying as an anti-pattern.</p>
<p>Take the God Object anti-pattern for example. This is a class that knows too much or does too many things. Instead of separating the functionality in many small classes or functions, we have put it in a single “all-knowing” object. It maintains most of the data that the app needs and provides the methods for its manipulation.</p>
<p>This is a pattern that has proven to cause more harm than good. Instead of having multiple components communicating to each other, such programs are tightly coupled to the God Object. A single change to it can have unintended consequences across the whole application.</p>
<p>The reasons to label a technique as an anti-pattern vary. It may make code hard to maintain, read, scale or extend. The bottom line is that they have more negative than desirable effects. So, while we shouldn’t be forcing design patterns, we should be active avoiding anti-patterns.</p>
<p>When we find that we’re using a technique widely considered harmful we should reevaluate our decisions and consider different approaches.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design patterns are like principles, general rules that have proven to work well</li>
<li>When faced with frequently occurring problem we can follow those rules and patterns instead of solving the problem from scratch</li>
<li>Design patterns are established, understood and easily recognized software practices</li>
<li>We should be aiming to recognize when an existing pattern is applicable to our problem. But we shouldn’t be forcing one when it’s not the obvious solution.</li>
<li>Anti-patterns are the opposite - they are frequently occurring practices that have proven to cause more harm than good. We should be actively avoiding them.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>At one point</strong> during the aptly titled opening song â€˜Feed the Fireâ€™ at the 1993 Hamburg Jazz Festival, the improvising singer <em>par excellence</em> Betty Carter went to sing a line but the audience heard nothing â€“ her microphone lead had dropped out of its socket. Where others might have stumbled, Carter magically weaved the equipment malfunction into a memorable and joyous moment. Without missing a beat, she raised her arms in the air, danced in a circle, reinserted the lead, and picked up where she left off with a quick-fire improvised line and a wry laugh â€“ all the while, composing new music. For much of the performance, Carter was like a preacher moved by the spirit, singing an improvised language beyond literal meaning but that carried the weight and wonder of other worlds.</p>
<p>How do singers such as Betty Carter take command of the present moment, seemingly bending reality to their will? While more romantic notions of creativity might point to Carter, and others like her, being â€˜touched by the spiritâ€™, there are less lofty explanations related to the physical dimension of making music with the human body, as well as the singerâ€™s skilful musical interplay with the other musicians and the audience. There are also complex cognitive and psychological processes that drive the â€˜real-timeâ€™ spontaneous creation of music.</p>
<p>A greater appreciation of these factors has implications beyond jazz, for how we all live our lives, moment to moment. Much of our everyday lives is improvised. For example, aside from stressful situations that require a script in advance, nearly every conversation you have is a spontaneous creation conducted without preparation.</p>
<p>For jazz singers, of course, it all starts with the voice â€“ arguably the first musical instrument. When Carter improvises, she uses her voice to convey not only song lyrics, but also to generate unintelligible yet inherently musical improvisations, often in response to the other musicians, the environment, as well as her own bodily and emotional states (sometimes this is referred to as â€˜scat singingâ€™, though this term is falling out of favour).</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, improvised jazz singing is a neurophysiological process. Carter creates musical sound using her lungs as a power source and her larynx as a sound generator, in combination with the resonant properties of the vocal tract. When her brain perceives a pitch or note, the breathing apparatus and the intrinsic muscles of the larynx move in a coordinated and sophisticated response. The vocal folds open and close to â€˜chop upâ€™ the pressurised airflow from the lungs. The length, mass and stiffness of the vocal folds contribute to creating the â€˜fundamental frequencyâ€™ of the sound, which we the audience perceive as pitch. For some perspective on the miraculous nature of this process, consider that the vocal folds must open and close 440 times <em>per second</em> to create the single musical note A440 Hz â€“ used as the standard for A above middle C<em>.</em> In turn, these sound waves are resounded and articulated by the <a href="https://dood.al/pinktrombone/">malleable vocal tract</a> to create vowels, consonants and tone colours, which we perceive as sung pitches and language.</p>
<p>From the first coos of mother to baby to the musical creations of Betty Carter, improvisation is pervasive in human experience</p>
<p>In addition to the complex neurophysiology of phonation, there are cognitive and psychological processes involved in the spontaneous creation of music. When researchers <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001679">scanned</a> the brains of jazz pianists improvising (as compared to when they performed learned sequences), they saw consistent and unique patterns of brain activation and deactivation. This activity likely reflects the distinct cognitive processes involved in improvisation, in particular the way that the musician must overcome the limitations of the brainâ€™s processing capacity when faced with limitless possibilities. Musicians do this by building a vast conceptual knowledge base over time that â€˜feedsâ€™ improvisation, as well as developing finely attuned motor skills and the ability to use feedback instantaneously during improvisation.</p>
<p>The same cognitive processes are likely to be involved in the musical sophistication of a singer like Carter. However, she was not a â€˜brain in a vatâ€™ when she improvised. To fully explain vocal improvisation, the physical fact of her body as a container for her voice demands that we also pay some attention to the body.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical and empirical</strong> advances in embodied cognition lend support to the notion that the body is more involved in improvisation than purely â€˜information processingâ€™ <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer">theories</a> suggest. The embodiment hypothesis views the body as playing a constitutive role in human cognition, contending that we understand and know the world, not just as mental representations in the brain, but through bodily experience. Performances by singers such as Carter, in which the music literally originates in the body, support a deeper investigation into the bodyâ€™s role, not just in improvisation, but in cognition more broadly.</p>
<p>I recently <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305735619899137">interviewed</a> professional jazz singers about what itâ€™s like to improvise, and their accounts also point towards a level of total bodily engagement beyond phonation and cognitive processing. They described being in a flow state during improvisation, experiencing a merging of action and awareness, a sense of control and focused concentration, losing track of time and a loss of self-consciousness. They saw this experience as a meaningful part of their lives because their complete absorption in the music made them feel a part of something â€˜bigger than themselvesâ€™. This chimes with findings within positive psychology where flow is directly implicated in eudaimonia â€“ a sense of happiness and human flourishing.</p>
<p>The singers I interviewed also described improvised music as, metaphorically, â€˜flowingâ€™. They likened improvisation to travelling on a journey to a specific location (you have to â€˜let goâ€™ and â€˜get into the zoneâ€™), and to bodily movement (you â€˜sort of swing through the trees and â€¦ no-one fallsâ€™). One singer described her body as a â€˜vesselâ€™ for the music to â€˜flow throughâ€™. These metaphors point towards a deep level of embodiment during improvisation and flow, and further implicate the body in improvisatory <a href="https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.16.22.4/mto.16.22.4.goldman.html">ways of knowing.</a></p>
<p>My own ongoing work, and that of others, to unravel the mysteries of musical improvisation has implications for our understanding of everyday life. From the first coos of mother to baby, to our next conversational utterance, to the sophisticated improvised musical creations of Betty Carter, improvisation is pervasive in human experience. What can we learn from the improvising jazz singer and how might we apply these lessons to live a more creative and fulfilling life?</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-art-of-becoming-9780190840914?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp;">book</a> <em>The Art of Becoming</em> (2020), the Scottish musicians and psychologists Raymond MacDonald and Graeme Wilson place improvisation at the heart of the human experience. They argue that improvising experiences Â­â€“ both musical and non-musical â€“ shape our identity and our place in the world. We become who we are by how we improvise moment to moment, day to day, year to year. Our identity is the accumulation of these improvised moments. These experiences are housed, felt, endured and enjoyed in our minds and our bodies. Improvising jazz singers show us that deep embodiment of the present moment can transform the mundane into the transcendent. The ability to improvise, to respond with our whole being to each moment creatively, intuitively and joyfully â€“ just like Betty Carter â€“ is the art of becoming fully human.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <div>
          <p>Long time no see!
This time I would like to write about a library I was working about a couple years ago,
a serializers library in Ruby.
I have actually finished it about a year ago and I always wanted to create this blog post
but last year has been super busy for me so never got the chance to present it properly :)</p>



<p>But first I would like to talk about serializers in Ruby from a historical perspective :)</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in 2013-2014</h3>

<p>Back in 2014, when I started working with APIs, go-to library for serializing Ruby
classes was <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">ActiveModelSerializers</a>, the newly published 0.9.x version.
Back then, with this awesome library we were building basic GraphQL-like structures, before
GraphQL was even announced! It was a joy working with a such powerful tool
where the client could specify which fields it needs from a specific resource but also
which relations.
You could inject exactly what you needed when you were actually rendering the serializer
which meant that you could take a union of client’s desired fields/associations,
the default fields/associations (if client’s input was empty), and what client was allowed to access.
The result was a super flexible API.</p>

<p>Apart from AMS, there was <a href="https://github.com/ismasan/oat">Oat</a> a pretty nice little library which supported
out of the box <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> and <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">JSON:API</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jbuilder</a> which for some
reason felt like Godzilla to me at that point, but to be honest it’s a completely proper way of
building hypermedia APIs in Ruby since you can do a lot of cool stuff with caching.
However the catch is that you can’t create reusable adapters, basically it’s like
Rails views, everything needs to be implemented from scratch.</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in 2015-2016</h3>

<p>Going forward, in 2015, the AMS rewrite had already begun since 2014 for the
0.10.x version. For various reasons, in the company I was working at that time, it was decided
to go with the 0.10.x and of course we completely regretted it. At that point it was 0.10.RC4 that we
were using, just 1 RC release before the 0.10.0. Now you can tell me, “of course
what do you expect? You were using an RC version” and you might be right. Only that the frustration
didn’t come from things that weren’t polished 100%.
I would be fine with that and I was eager to help out.
The frustration came from the fact that the architecture was a completely different beast
from 0.9 and 0.8 versions, everything were different, code and (the sparse) documentation.
And I am saying this because I <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=author%3Avasilakisfil">did try</a> to help out sending pull requests, and the more
I was working with the code, the more frustrated I got.</p>

<p>Here are some things that come to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>both 0.8/0.9 and 0.10.x are using the same repo, although they share completely different
API/code, making things extremely confusing from a API developer perspective, but also
very difficult to manage as well from a contributor’s perspective</li>
<li>super complex overall architecture</li>
<li>the gem made JSON:API as first citizen. That’s inflexible to build adapters for different
specs and has affected pretty much everything in the code.
The previous versions were using the AMS API style (mostly json with some very basic patterns). 0.10.x version
also supported that style but the code for that was like a completely different
branch inside the code (not sure if it’s still like that but I guess it is).
I understand that JSON:API is a quite popular spec, but tight the whole generic library to that
spec is a bad design, I think.</li>
<li>too many dependencies (requires ActiveSupport..)</li>
<li>tightly coupled to ActiveRecord (at least at that time, not sure if now has changed..)</li>
<li>caching was implemented in the same library. I really thing that’s a completely different concern..</li>
<li>some parts did not match the Ruby coding style (like include: ‘a,string,of,resources’, default_includes ‘**’)</li>
<li>maintainers were reluctant to merge pull requests, because even in the Github issues was an extreme
confusion of what’s implemented, what’s missing, what bugs exists etc</li>
</ul>

<p>In one word <strong>it was a failure</strong>. Like, imagine the most popular Serializers gem in Ruby,
Rails team <a href="https://medium.com/@joaomdmoura/the-future-of-ams-e5f9047ca7e9">was pushing them</a> to finish in-time before the release of Rails 5 so they can include
it in the same release (although completely different gem, I guess they would make a note about it),
maintainers were struggling to make this happen and of course it didn’t.</p>

<p>Now I should also pause a bit and say that <strong>I have nothing against the commiters/maintainers</strong>.
They definitely <strong>did their best, and the problem wasn’t lying there</strong>.
It’s just that sometimes Open Source projects fail.
And in my experience they fail, when there isn’t a very tight core team that has the same vision,
coding style and are gatekeepers in pull requests, until the library has proved itself.
Then, any new pull request will probably respect the existing code and won’t challenge it.
Merging code will be much easier, at that point.</p>

<p>Instead with AMS, <strong>different people started the rework, different people took over
and did their best to finish it</strong>, and for the whole time, various people were sending pull
requests for various features and bugs, of course to help out, but what happened
was a very complex architecture with no clear design and vision.
Actually it would be a great idea to take some interviews by the project contributors at that time.
I think they will have some insights to contribute regarding to what happened :)</p>

<p>During my frustration with AMS I always wondered: how difficult can it be to
build a feature-complete Ruby Serializers ? Well, it turned out to be a bit more complex
than I initially thought. <strong>Way more complex</strong> :)</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in  2017-2018</h3>

<p>I guess I wasn’t the one who was a bit frustrated with AMS.
<a href="https://github.com/beauby">beauby</a>, an AMS core member went off and created a JSON:API specific serializers gem,
the <a href="https://github.com/jsonapi-rb">jsonapi-rb</a>.
It follows spec pretty well and should be fine using it.
It’s also dependency free.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a year later (2018) Netflix came over and published <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">their own
JSON:API serializers gem</a> which is extremely fast to be honest.
Like <strong>SUPER FAST</strong>.
Unfortunately it requires ActiveSupport as a dependency (not sure why, earlier releases didn’t)
and that could be a bummer for some applications.
Also it might not be as flexible as AMS or jsonapi-rb (although latest releases have
closed the gap A LOT), but in my experience it’s flexible enough that you will
almost never need to look for something else.</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers today</h3>

<p>Today, if someone asked me which Serializers gem should I use, I would tell him/her
go for the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">fast_jsonapi</a> gem. It’s super fast, it supports a quite popular API
spec and you must have a really good reason to not use it.</p>

<p>Personally, <strong>I am a bit against of having links inside the response</strong>, treating the
client as plain stupid. That’s one of the reasons why I don’t like JSON:API.
I think it’s just too verbose.
(The other reason is the naming: they picked up the 2 most popular words regarding APIs,
<em>JSON</em> and <em>API</em>, glued them together and made the name, feels so much cheating..)
I like to load off some work to the client using introspective
methods. I have talked <a href="https://introspected.rest/">about it</a> some time ago.
But if anyone came and asked me what I would suggest for a brand new API, my
answer would be pretty straightforward: <strong>JSON:API, unless you have good reasons
not to</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s the more experienced API designers that might want to implement something more
versatile and more advanced, tailored to a specific use case.
Or might want to experiment a bit.
For instance, another cool API spec that’s in the same philosophy as JSON:API is
<a href="https://ionspec.org/">Ion</a>.
Not as popular as JSON:API but worth checking it out!
Problem is that when you need to implement something different from JSON:API,
in Ruby you don’t really have much options. Well you have, it’s AMS but it will
be pain in the ass to create a custom serializer from that one.
And it will be painstakingly slow.
And you can’t have more advanced concepts, like forms, relations on collections
etc.
Or you could use <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jbuilder</a>, but the problem with jbuilder is that it can’t
have the notion of adapters, hence you always need to build the final result
from scratch. Not fun.</p>

<h3>SimpleAMS: Modern Ruby Serializers</h3>

<p>When I started working on the prototype of SimpleAMS, I set a couple of goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted the library to be super simple, easy to use with injectable API and clean code.
Have you seen <a href="https://github.com/varvet/pundit">pundit</a>? I want a pundit for serializing.</li>
<li>One of the things that I sometimes don’t like in Ruby coding style, is the level of assumptions that the
code makes on behalf of you.
It had been a quite common pattern in Ruby/Rails that lead to many confusion of what
exactly the API is while at the same time such patterns reduce the flexibility.
The code is trying to act smart, but the drawbacks of such smartness overweight the gains.
I feel some basic assumptions which can be overridden at anytime is the ideal.
Embracing clean, explicit code is what I want, so that you can understand what’s happening instantly.</li>
<li>I wanted to create a generic abstraction as a first class citizen. From there
you should be able to implement any serializer needed, but that abstraction should be
powerful enough to cover even the most extreme corner cases.
After all, it’s tough to beat <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">fast_jsonapi</a>, that’s shouldn’t be my goal ;)</li>
<li>I wanted super clean code, no smarty complex meta thingies inside the code.
I also wanted expected behavior on the internals and how it works when someone
started looking in the codebase.
Of course except the <a href="https://github.com/vasilakisfil/SimpleAMS/blob/master/lib/simple_ams/dsl.rb">DSL part</a>, which uses some advanced Ruby metaprogramming concepts,
but that’s necessary if we want it to work with just an <code>include</code>.</li>
<li>Much faster than AMS, it’s well known that AMS is quite slow so that should be easy :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The API</h3>

<p>Before starting on any new project, I like to put my imagination and come up
with a useful API and use cases.
Being in god mode, and leaving all the constraints on the side, you can come up with
some really cool APIs.</p>

<h4>DSL based API</h4>

<p>So how would you use a serializers library in Ruby?
I want to avoid any inheritance in order to use SimpleAMS,
because …</p></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[7 Reasons Your Growth Startup Is Hiring Too Junior]]>
            </title>

September 11, 2020 | https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/09/11/Hiring-Too-Junior.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/09/11/Hiring-Too-Junior.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Growth startups often find themselves lacking senior team members as they scale. The problems that arise from this are plentiful, including things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requiring heroics to fix things</li>
  <li>Penalizing junior team members for failure to meet responsibilities well above their pay grade.</li>
  <li>Building technology that doesn’t scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s some reasons why companies get into this situation.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-habit">Reason 1: Habit</h2>

<p>When you’re a tiny startup budgets are extremely lean and products don’t have a lot of users. In that environment companies often prioritize breadth of functionality (see what works) and getting that via several (more affordable) junior team members guided by a smaller group of senior team members.</p>

<p>Problems arise if that strategy exists past market fit. The add-a-junior-to-do-more strategy implodes as the team grows too large for the senior staff to manage closely and the technical challenges start to look more daunting.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-hubris">Reason 2: Hubris</h2>

<p>Sometimes people recognize the problems are getting more difficult but still don’t hire more seniors. This can often be chalked up to hubris - surely I can just direct a bunch of juniors to execute on the genius solutions I come up with for all our problems. The problem here is that you’re not a genius and even if you were that strategy doesn’t scale.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-fear">Reason 3: Fear</h2>

<p>The flip side of hubris is fear. New senior staff can look like a threat to the power of existing senior staff. You might have to choose between doing what’s right for the company and retaining certain kinds of power. The answer there is simple - it’s better to be part of something great than the owner of something that fails.</p>

<p>A different play on this theme is junior teammates fearing that new senior teammates will take away some of their opportunities. It’s possible, sure. But more often the opportunities they will take over are the ones juniors would have had trouble succeeding in.</p>

<p>In a growing company with reasonably difficult challenges, good seniors will do more to expand the set of opportunities than shrink them. And good senior talent will help juniors via mentorship and guidance.</p>

<h2 id="reason-4-money-issues">Reason 4: Money Issues</h2>

<p>Money issues play out in a couple ways.</p>

<p>First, the cost of senior talent can subconsciously make you concerned about the remaining budget for yourself. I haven’t seen this played out directly and blatantly, but it’s another version of the fear game - assuming compensation is a zero sum game leads to weird incentives.</p>

<p>Second, it’s easy to think 2 juniors are better than one senior. As you read about the myth of the 10x engineer you might find yourself thinking this way. Let’s talk more about how this is a misconception in reason 5…</p>

<h2 id="reason-5-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-for-right-now">Reason 5: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills For Right Now</h2>

<p>As referenced earlier, problems get much harder when you add significant growth to a platform. It’s not uncommon to underestimate the challenges at hand. In reality, even simple products at massive scale need significant senior leadership to ensure they are being built and operated effectively. Trying to replace the leadership of senior talent with a volume of junior talent is a sure-fire way to screw this up.</p>

<h2 id="reason-6-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-in-the-future">Reason 6: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills In the Future</h2>

<p>To make things more difficult, you don’t just have to hire for right now, you have to hire for 2 or more years in the future. The senior talent you hire now must seed the leadership ranks you need in the future. Especially in product and engineering, you can’t just hire everyone you need when you need them. For starters, the job market would laugh at that sort of just-in-time attempt at hiring. But also, these roles require much more detailed understanding of the systems at play, so you need to have people with intimate knowledge developed in advance.</p>

<p>Think of it this way - look at whatever company you’re trying to be like in 5 years. Look at their team. If you don’t start hiring towards something like that team sooner rather than later you’ll never be that company.</p>

<h2 id="reason-7-arguments-about-what-seniors-need">Reason 7: Arguments About What-Seniors-Need</h2>

<p>Another reason people hire too junior is thinking around senior talent needing explicit areas of responsibility that don’t overlap. This is the “one alpha” theory - that senior talent can’t collaborate productively and need their own pack. There might be some nuggets of truth here, but most of it is nonsense. That’s like NASA saying they couldn’t have smart people work together on getting to the moon because these great scientists need their own domains.</p>

<p>Ultimately you have to look at the problems you’re solving. If they are truly challenging they can support a number of seniors. If they aren’t you’ll probably have trouble hiring and retaining more than a few.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of reasons why you might hire too junior as your company grows. Know them and hire intentionally.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let's face it, It is not easy to choose a freaking PC these days with the deluge of specifications that come with it let alone FPGAs. The question of using FPGAs to solve any computing problem only arises when an extraordinary performance is required. Owing to this fact, FPGAs in their feature specification and build can be extremely specific to the application at hand. This results in an insane number of varieties in terms of the logic structures within the FPGA as well as the interfaces that are provided with the external world. However, this guide aims to guide you in the right direction (which does not mean dumping a list of the hundreds of different options out there) based on your level of experience and requirement.</p>
<p>There are other posts out there that provide large tables with exhaustive lists of FPGA development boards out there and let you (after a year or two of research) make a choice. If that's your thing, I'll attach some links to help you get started.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're already familiar with the various bells and whistles of  FPGAs and are only looking for some good suggestions, you might prefer to <a href="https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide#the-top-contenders"><strong>JUMP TO THE LIST OF SUGGESTIONS</strong></a>.  If not, read on to learn some very important stuff about the FPGA world and how to choose better!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-be-looking-for"><a href="#what-you-should-be-looking-for" aria-label="what you should be looking for permalink"></a>What you should be looking for</h2>
<p>There are already a lot of aspects to an FPGA in general that determine its fit to a particular problem and the ease with which it can be programmed, now add to this the complexity of a feature-rich development board with all sorts of peripherals, interfaces, connectors and memory options you have at hand a humongous task of deciding between hundreds of varieties out there.</p>
<h3 id="soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga"><a href="#soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga" aria-label="soc based board or just an fpga permalink"></a>SOC based board or just an FPGA?</h3>
<p>SOC stands for <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/ic-types/system-on-chip/" target="_blank">System-on-Chip</a> which simply means that various interacting technologies are built onto the same die (/chip). You see SOCs everywhere, on your phones, TVs, and computers. In the context of an FPGA development board, a SOC based system means that the hardware has two components, a sea of programmable logic (the FPGA) and a hard processor core implemented in silicon independent of the programmable FPGA logic. Interfaces are created between the programmable logic and the processing system (in Xilinx lingo) that enable communication between the two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://thedatabus.io/static/zynq7000-ae213195db5b530cc3f5d60785b3b0b1.png" alt="Zynq7000"></p>
<p>If you are an absolute beginner looking for direction, you should definitely choose a SOC based system because of the immense additional learning potential it adds. Having said that, your first few digital design projects should never involve the processor cores or any kind of software programming. For that, you can just ignore the processor logic and dump your design into the programmable region to use it as a normal FPGA. As you progress, you can add much higher levels of complexity to your design by bringing in the processor core to directly read and write data in your configurable hardware. You can also experiment with writing firmware, drivers, the Linux OS, and the higher levels of abstraction thus getting a truly holistic experience of embedded system design. Even the simplest SOC based board will keep you busy for a long time. </p>
<p>These boards can also be of great interest for Software engineers looking to explore into the digital design world since processor + FPGA structures lend themselves very well to paradigms like HLS, Heterogenous computing and partial acceleration of algorithms. Viewing the FPGA logic as an extension of the SOC is something that is going to be very important in the future and is a good investment of your time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, If you are a beginner but are looking only to learn digital design or you wish to buy a board to complement your studies at college where you get to use a particular board in your lab, you can get a lot more basic FPGA resources (LUTs, BRAMs, DSPs) on a Non-SOC based board that has only the FPGA. This way you save money and have a much less complex system at hand that you can comprehend better. The same is true If you plan to implement something specific that takes up an enormous number of resources, you might be better off going for a dev board that has only the FPGA and the required peripherals.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9yutk8/best_100300_fpga_development_board_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this post</a> on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/" target="_blank">r/FPGA</a> user <strong>u/ndbroadbent</strong> has shown the resource usages of several open source projects, this can give you a good idea of how big projects usually are.</p>
<p><strong>An important note for beginners</strong> : <em>Having an SOC board, with all the processor logic around the FPGA can really deviate you from the basic idea of programmable logic and how you're supposed to learn it. I strongly suggest completely disregarding anything to do with the processor for your first few projects and use only the FPGA part of the device. Also note that as of today, any good FPGA engineer will tell you that any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis#:~:text=High%2Dlevel%20synthesis%20(HLS),hardware%20that%20implements%20that%20behavior."><strong>HLS</strong></a> is not good enough to be used in real world projects. This is doubly true for the beginners. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fall into the 'Write code in C++/Python and run it on FPGA' trap. A lot of youtubers seem to be promoting stuff like that for beginners these days which is just sad. If you have the money to spend, the ideal (and more enjoyable) learning strategy would be to use a standalone FPGA board first and upgrade to an SOC later.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="interfaces-and-ios"><a href="#interfaces-and-ios" aria-label="interfaces and ios permalink"></a>Interfaces and IOs:</h3>
<p>FPGAs are excellent tools for working on high-speed interfaces. So you might want to look at the interfaces and IO options a particular development board is providing. This is important because if the board has a particular interface out of the box, the vendor will probably provide the necessary documentation and sample designs for those interfaces. This can save you tons of head-scratching and hair-pulling (trust me that is common in the FPGA world) as a beginner. That's not to say that newer interfaces cannot be added to the board manually but when it comes to High-speed interfaces like Ethernet, HDMI, PCIe, it can be very difficult to add them yourself and expect reliable performance. Low-speed ones like SPI, UART, etc can always be manually added using the GPIOs, so let them not be the dealbreaker for any board.</p>
<p>Some common networking interfaces that you should look for are high-speed interfaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank"><strong>HDMI</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" target="_blank"><strong>VGA</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" target="_blank"><strong>ETHERNET</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank"><strong>PCIe</strong></a>  etc. and low-speed peripherals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface" target="_blank"><strong>SP</strong>I</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank"><strong>CAN</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank"><strong>I2C</strong></a>  etc.</p>
<p>Although not as important for a beginner, another set of interfaces that can be useful are the analog and sensor interfaces like ADCs, DACs, Camera Interface, Audio CODECs, etc. These are very niche features that can make or break a particular project if it depends on data acquisition from the external world.</p>
<p>If you choose to go for a board with not too many peripherals for whatever reason, you might be better off choosing one that has the industry-standard <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/" target="_blank"><strong>PMOD</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card" target="_blank"><strong>FMC</strong></a> connectors installed so that when you do need additional interfaces in the future, they can be added very easily. These standard connectors essentially decouple FPGA carrier boards from the IO engines (which plug-in as daughter cards), enabling you to use the same FPGA boards with a large variety of IO designs without ever having to re-design the board.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="buttons-leds-and-displays"><a href="#buttons-leds-and-displays" aria-label="buttons leds and displays permalink"></a>Buttons, LEDs, and Displays:</h3>
<p>Debugging FPGA designs can be a hard thing. Unlike MCUs where you can place print statements and breakpoints anywhere you want in the code, there is no such equivalent in the FPGA world and that can often lead to great frustration. One workaround is possible, if there are switches and LEDs on your board. They provide an easy way to pull out signals to the real world and give you an indication of the status of some status registers that can help you visualize and debug (like the current state of a state machine or a particular flag in a CPU design). However, this should not be the deciding factor between two boards since it is very easy to add LEDs, buttons, switches, and LCDs using the GPIO connectors without much effort.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="memory-and-resource-count"><a href="#memory-and-resource-count" aria-label="memory and resource count permalink"></a>Memory and Resource Count:</h3>
<p>The Resource Count is another important metric that goes into deciding on an FPGA device. By resource, we mean the number of programmable logic elements available on the board. These can be LUTs (ALMs for Altera), Block Rams, DSPs, and IO blocks. Much more complex and fancier devices like the  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/acap/versal.html" target="_blank"> Versal family</a> from Xilinx can have lots of other stuff like AI, video, and audio cores, etc. It is important to take note of these resource numbers because they determine the biggest project that you can successfully fit onto the FPGA. It is hard to come up with a fixed count for a particular project owing to differences in the underlying CLB architecture from vendor to vendor and family to family.</p>
<p>FPGAs store the configuration(bitstream) data on the SRAM (usually) cells within the FPGA. Since SRAM is a volatile kindof memory, the program is lost each time the board is power-cycled. A PC support is needed to reprogram it again after the power cycle, to prevent this, FLASH (or EEPROM in older boards) based storage is provided onboard by the vendors. Flash is a non-volatile form of storage that holds the bitstream data even without a power supply. Each time the board comes up after a power cycle, the FPGA checks the flash memory for a bitstream and programs itself with it. This is usually given by default in most boards but can be something important to look out for. </p>
<p>The other important form of memory is the external onboard volatile storage which is most commonly provided in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM" target="_blank">DDR SDRAM</a>  This is extremely useful if you are building an application that needs to store data locally for whatever reason. Since the block ram storage within the FPGA fabric is very little and is very precious, having a DDR that can be written to and read from in a reasonable amount of time is very much essential. The more the better!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this post we'll compare rich GraphQL clients that come with a normalized cache implementation and the generated WunderGraph clients that rely on HTTP caching.</p><p>As you might have already found out, WunderGraph uses persisted queries by default.
With the WunderGraph code generator WunderGen(<a href="https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergen</a>) you can generate a client that knows exactly how to invoke your previously registered operations.
With the <code>@cache</code> directive you're able to configure that the response of an operation should be cached by the server &amp; client.
Cache Control headers will be set accordingly, including etags. This mechanism is fully compatible with all major browsers and CDN's who implement caching according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP Caching RFC</a>.</p><p>To illustrate this a bit better I'd like to introduce two example queries.
The first one fetches a list of friends.
The second one fetches some details about those friends.</p><p>Let's consider we want to show a list of friends:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>query</span><span> Friends </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    friends </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        id</span></p><p><span>        name</span></p><p><span>        age</span></p><p><span>        avatarURL</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For each friend we'd like to be able to click on the friend in the list and open up a detail page:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>query</span><span> FriendByID </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    friend</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        id</span></p><p><span>        name</span></p><p><span>        age</span></p><p><span>        avatarURL</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>You will recognize that we already have all the data for the detail page.
So in an ideal scenario the client won't have to make another request.
This is possible thanks to cache normalization.</p><p>A smart normalized cache will identify the Friend entity and will recognize that the "FriendByID" query can be fulfilled using the data from the "Friends" query which we already ran.</p><p>What are the pros of this concept?</p><ul><li>Navigating to a friend detail page will be instant because there is no network request required</li><li>The client will save bandwidth, and the user experience will be more fluent</li><li>If we navigate back we can also immediately pull out the list of friends from the normalized cache</li></ul><p>How can this situation become hairy?
Let's add a third operation. While on a user detail page we'd like to unfriend one of our peers:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>mutation</span><span> Unfriend </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    unfriend</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>How does the <code>unfriend</code> mutation make the situation complex?
In your normalized cache you have to invalidate or update the "Friends" and "Friend" entities.
In your friends list you have to remove the user with id 123.
For the <code>Friends</code> you have to make sure no friend is returned for id 123 anymore.</p><p>How does your normalized cache draw the lines between the <code>unfriend</code> mutation and the <code>friend</code> and <code>friends</code> query?
You as the frontend developer have to program the cache to do so.
After the mutation you must inform the cache about these changes.</p><p>With that let's talk about the cons of a normalized cache:</p><ul><li>a rich GraphQL client with a normalized cache is complex to build and maintain</li><li>the cache is running in the javascript vm of your browser and therefore a lot less efficient than the browser cache</li><li>the logic to keep the cache state correct can become quite hairy</li><li>the frontend developer must understand the domain and program the cache correctly to avoid unwanted behaviour</li><li>the frontend developer must implement custom rules for cache eviction</li></ul><p>One thing that I want to explicitly mention outside of the list:</p><h2>There's no single source of truth for the business object in this scenario.</h2><p>The frontend developer might accidentally allow the UI to show a friend in the friends list even if you have previously unfriended said person.
Errors like these are very hard to spot. I think we're giving the frontend developer a lot of responsibility in this case to get caching right.</p><p>Should it really be a concern of a frontend developer if data is stale? Shouldn't a frontend developer focus on the UI and trust the data layer? Does it really have to be that complicated to build rich apps with good performance?</p><p>I believe there are applications where it's definitely worth having such a complexity.
On the other hand I see many use cases, eg a news website, where relying on the HTTP Caching RFC is a lot simpler and more efficient.</p><h2>Enter WunderGraph caching:</h2><p>With WunderGraph every registered Query becomes an endpoint to which you can apply caching rules individually.</p><p>Let's revisit the example from above:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>query</span><span> FriendByID </span><span>@cache</span><span>(</span><span>maxAge</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    friend</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        id</span></p><p><span>        name</span></p><p><span>        age</span></p><p><span>        avatarURL</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>This Query becomes the following endpoint on your WunderGraph Node:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>/</span><span>application</span><span>-</span><span>id</span><span>/</span><span>FriendByID</span><span>?</span><span>variables</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span>123</span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this scenario we decided to cache a friend object for 5 seconds using the <code>@cache</code> directive.
After 5 seconds the client will re-request the user and send an <code>If-None-Match</code> header with the request.
If the previous response is still valid the server will respond with a <code>304 (Not Modified)</code> http status code.
The same logic can be applied to the <code>Friends</code> Query.
All you have to do is define the desired behaviour using directives on the Operations.</p><p>What are the pros of this approach?</p><ul><li>there's a single source of truth - the Operation Definition</li><li>caching is handled automatically by the browser which is easier to use and understand</li><li>no complex tooling is required to understand why a request is cached, browsers have excellent debuggers for this</li><li>no javascript code has to be written to keep the cache state in sync</li><li>with a service worker you can easily build offline apps using standard caching techniques</li><li>less javascript code to be run by the browser</li><li>the frontend developer gets to focus on the UI and has to worry less about data fetching and caching logic</li></ul><p>What are the cons of HTTP caching for GraphQL queries?</p><ul><li>the client has to make more requests than with a normalized cache</li><li>more requests lead to more bandwidth usage</li><li>there's no easy way to invalidate the cache immediately</li></ul><h2>Does a normalized cache prevent us from doing more requests?</h2><p>Let's make this scenario a bit more realistic. On the friends detail page we'd like to see the bio of the friend too:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>query</span><span> FriendByID </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    friend</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        id</span></p><p><span>        name</span></p><p><span>        age</span></p><p><span>        avatarURL</span></p><p><span>        bio</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>With this one field added even with normalized caching we have to refetch each individual friend even though we already have most of the data.
At the end of the day a normalized cache might introduce a lot of complexity to your app while the benefits are not as huge as you expect.
In this last example you could have saved to transfer less fields for each user detail page at the expense of a complex GraphQL client that understands which fields are missing for an entity.</p><h2>Cache invalidation</h2><p>As mentioned previously, a normalized cache can easily be invalidated.
This comes at the cost of implementing and maintaining the cache code plus defining the logic when to invalidate which objects.</p><p>With HTTP caching it's not that easy.
You could add a dynamic parameter, e.g. a timestamp, to the Query.
This would allow for easy cache invalidation but also reduces possible cache hits.</p><h2>Users can have multiple clients</h2><p>Is it possible for your users to open your application in multiple tabs, native applications, etc.?
If that's the case what happens if you unfriend a user in one tab while you have another tab open?
At that point your normalized cache has no way of figuring out if data is stale, it needs to make a network call if you switch tabs.</p><h2>Should you cache at all?</h2><p>Are we actually solving the problem at the right layer or creating a new, even more complex, problem?</p><p>If data like in this example could change any time at any click (add friend/unfriend) should we really cache this at the client or transport level at all?</p><p>Why not use an application cache, e.g. Redis or Memcached, in the Backend if hitting the database directly is a performance bottleneck?
In this scenario, neither transport level caching, nor a normalized client cache is the proper solution.</p><h2>When to cache</h2><p>Caching makes sense for publicly available data that doesn't change frequently.</p><p>E.g. on a news website it's totally fine to cache the content for each article for a few seconds (e.g. 5).
This would reduce the amount of requests from thousands to one per resource per 5 seconds.</p><p>In case data can change at high frequencies, especially after user interactions with the application, caching should happen at the application layer.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>When you think you have to use a normalized cache in the client you should consider an application level cache first.</p><p>A normalized cache introduces a second source of truth in the frontend which needs to be maintained.
Optimistic can get that last bit of performance out of an app to get the user experience from 95% to 98% at the cost of extra complexity.</p><p>Most of the time you don't need this complexity and should avoid it.
Keep it simple, solve a business problem, don't introduce technical debt.</p><p>WunderGraph gives you a simple and powerful way to use transport based caching.
For 99% of the other use cases you should consider adding an application level cache if performance is an issue.</p></section></div>]]>

<p>Iâ€™ve been a staunch Vim user for a long time now, and recently switched over to
Emacs. Time to fight the other side of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">war</a>!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got years worth of muscle memory tied up to Vim Key Bindings, so itâ€™s
unlikely that Iâ€™d have considered this change if it werenâ€™t for
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil"><code>evil-mode</code></a>.</p>

<p>Before we start, an obligatory xkcd comic:</p>

<h2 id="emacs-distribution-vs-vanilla-emacs">Emacs Distribution vs Vanilla Emacs</h2>

<p>I went for an Emacs distribution over vanilla Emacs because there were two
things I didnâ€™t want to have to configure for scratch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A modern-looking UI</li>
  <li>Vim emulation layer</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up picking <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a>, because the README
resonated with what I was looking for, and it was pretty popular. I did feel
that it was likely to be too bloated for my use case, but <code>spacemacs-base</code> (a
minimal set of packages that you can build upon) seemed to solve that problem.</p>

<h2 id="spacemacs-the-good">Spacemacs: The Good</h2>

<p>A few features in Spacemacs that came as pleasant surprises:</p>

<h3 id="1-findreplace-live-preview">1. Find/Replace Live Preview</h3>

<p>Best explained with an asciicast:</p>



<p>Compared to this, find/replace in Vim feels like working with a blindfold on!
(Yes, I do use <code>:incsearch</code>)</p>

<h3 id="2-case-sensitive-substitution">2. Case-sensitive substitution</h3>

<p>Substitution in Spacemacs is case-sensitive by default, unlike in Vim where I
had to use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish">vim-abolish</a>.</p>

<p>For a good explanation as to why this is useful, read <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish"><code>vim-abolish</code>â€™s
README</a>. A quick excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One time I had an application with a domain model called â€œfacilityâ€� that needed
to be renamed to â€œbuildingâ€�. So, a simple search and replace, right?</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>:%s/facility/building/g</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Oh, but the case variants!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><code>:%s/Facility/Building/g</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><code>:%s/FACILITY/BUILDING/g</code></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><code>vim-abolish</code> combines all of these into one command.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="3-live-documentation">3. Live Documentation</h3>

<p>Learning key-bindings in Spacemacs is surprisingly easy, because it shows you
suggestions as you start a key sequence.</p>

<p><img src="https://rohitpaulk.com/images/articles/emacs-which-key.png" alt="which-key"></p>

<p>I later learnt that this is powered by the
<a href="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key"><code>which-key</code></a> package.</p>

<h2 id="spacemacs-the-bad">Spacemacs: The Bad</h2>

<p>Spacemacs shows a prompt on the first install that asks you whether you want to
use <code>spacemacs</code>, the full-featured distribution, or <code>spacemacs-base</code>, a minimal
set of packages that you can then build upon.</p>

<p><img src="https://rohitpaulk.com/images/articles/emacs-spacemacs-wizard.png" alt="spacemacs-wizard"></p>

<p>Since I wanted a minimalist setup that I could later configure as needed, I went
with <code>spacemacs-base</code>.</p>

<p>When I did reach out for configuration options though, problems started
cropping up.</p>

<p>While the Spacemacs config file is well-documented, a lot of the options in
there only apply to <code>spacemacs</code>, and not <code>spacemacs-base</code>. Toggling config
options felt something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>me</strong>: <em>changes config value</em></p>

  <p>Hmm, that didnâ€™t work. Maybe Iâ€™m using the wrong value?</p>

  <p><strong>me</strong>: <em>re-reads documentation</em></p>

  <p>Doesnâ€™t look like my mistake. Maybe a restart would help?</p>

  <p><strong>me</strong>: <em>restarts Emacs</em></p>

  <p>Still doesnâ€™t work.</p>

  <p><strong>me</strong>: <em>greps for config key in Spacemacs source code</em></p>

  <p><strong>me</strong>: <em>finds the layer that uses it</em></p>

  <p><strong>me</strong>: <em>tries to open layer documentation</em></p>

  <p><strong>spacemacs</strong>: <em>layer not enabled</em></p>

  <p>Oh, <code>spacemacs-base</code> ðŸ¤¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a couple of encounters like this, it started to become clear that
<code>spacemacs-base</code> was an afterthought, not a first-class citizen.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I then switched to <code>spacemacs</code> instead of <code>spacemacs-base</code>. My mistake was
apparent seconds later. After the reload, <code>spacemacs</code> installed <strong>~140</strong>
packages (iirc). Opening a project was noticeably slower, and when I started
editing files Spacemacs just kept freezing up randomly in the middle. Speak of
bloat ðŸ™„. Iâ€™m fine with not-so-fast startup times, but this was affecting basic
operations like navigating through a file. (For context, Iâ€™m running a pretty
lean setup: Arch Linux on an Macbook Air with 8 gigs of RAM)</p>

<p>I quickly course-corrected and switched back to <code>spacemacs-base</code>. Maybe the
wrangling with disabled layers wasnâ€™t so bad?</p>

<h2 id="spacemacs-the-ugly">Spacemacs: The Ugly</h2>

<p>Throughout my experience, the spacemacs documentation had always felt a bit
rough on the edges. I was able to note down 3-4 mistakes (simple ones) in the
first couple of hours. I didnâ€™t make much of this at first, just assumed that it
was because the project had a large amount of changes going in.</p>

<p>At the end of my first day with Spacemacs, I sat down to fix the documentation
mistakes I had identified. As the <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org">contributing
guide</a>
mentioned, I switched to <code>develop</code>. To my surprise, the fixes I intended to make
were already present!</p>

<p>Assuming that these were recent fixes that hadnâ€™t made it to <code>master</code> yet, I
checked the date on those commits. They were created <strong>2 years ago</strong>. I then
checked the latest stable release for Spacemacs - turns out it was released more
than a year ago. Something was wrong here. This isnâ€™t what one would expect from
a â€œcommunity-drivenâ€� Emacs distribution.</p>

<p>I asked for help on <a href="https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs">Gitter</a>, and was told
to use <code>develop</code> instead of <code>master</code>. That didnâ€™t sound right - The README
didnâ€™t mention anything about <code>develop</code>, and the online documentation was still
wired to <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>I then asked about this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/dxqa51/how_does_spacemacs_develop_master_sync_happen/">on
Reddit</a>,
and got this answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a persistent issue in the spacemacs community. I think only syl20bnr
has commit access to master and so only he gets to decide what commits are
worthy of being cherry picked into master. Master hasnâ€™t had a version bumb in
2 years despite <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/milestone/7">the v0.300 milestone being reached awhile
ago</a>. Hereâ€™s some github
issues that raise your question:
<a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/12418">#12418</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/11191">#11191</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The deeper issue of maintainers and repository access was <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/8686">addressed two years
ago</a>. Unfortunately things
havenâ€™t improved much since then since than. While there are fewer open PRs,
there are now over 2.3k open issues and that number only ever seems to grow.
This continues to <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/12082">prompt questions of more active forks/better
merging</a>.</p>

<h2 id="doom-emacs-to-the-rescue">DOOM Emacs to the rescue</h2>

<p>The fiasco with Spacemacs was enough to have me looking around for other
alternatives. A quick search yielded a lot of praise for
<a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">DOOM Emacs</a>. I didnâ€™t want to get rid
of Spacemacs altogether just yet, so I used <a href="https://github.com/plexus/chemacs">chemacs</a>
(an Emacs profile switcher) to install both side-by-side.</p>

<p>DOOM Emacs was far faster to boot, and had a more appealing &amp; minimalist UI
(IMHO). When I ran into installation troubles, <code>doom doctor</code> always had friendly
error messages. I was also impressed by the quality of answers in their
<a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://rohitpaulk.com/images/articles/emacs-doom.png" alt="doom-emacs"></p>

<p>I did have to customize DOOM Emacs a bit to get it running the way I wanted it
to though. Spacemacs, in comparison, was more useable out-of-the-box.</p>

<h2 id="news-from-the-dark-side">News from the dark side</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve now gotten to a point where Iâ€™m comfortable using Emacs as my primary
editor. Iâ€™m typing this article out in Emacs, with my web server process
running in a terminal <em>inside</em> Emacs.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t opened Vim in 3 days. In fact, Iâ€™ve <a href="https://twitter.com/RohitPaulK/status/1195410155623419904">aliased
it</a> to launch Emacs
instead.</p>

<p>My search history includes terms like â€œTodoist in Emacsâ€�, â€œWeb browser in Emacsâ€�
and â€œEmail client in Emacsâ€�.</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>Iâ€™m turning into one of <em>those</em> people, and Iâ€™m loving it.</p>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>For me, there comes a point at the end of every project where I’m just sick of it. I’m sick of the project. I’m sick of the technology. I’m sick of project management system. I’m sick of the code.</p>



<p>Sometimes, I just want to see the whole thing burn. Or better, just ship it. </p>



<p>Now, I think that there are two solutions to this problem, and which one you pick depends on your timeline. The first is to take a step back. Talk to a team mate. Work on something else. Talk a walk. Take an extra half hour for lunch. </p>



<p>This may give you perspective to help you dive back in and add just a bit more polish. That polish, which may take the form of additional UX refinement, testing, or even wordsmithing the help messages or marketing text, can help make the project shine. </p>



<p>That’s what I call ‘running through the finish line’ where you want to leave it all on the field. That doesn’t mean you don’t make compromises or that you won’t revisit decisions, but it does mean that you do the best you can. Sometimes to put in that final effort, you need to take a break.</p>



<p>The other choice is to just ship it. This is a good option when you are up against a deadline. It also helps if you know you are a perfectionist and/or afraid of putting your work out there. Nothing is perfect and if your work never sees the light of day because you can’t accept that, the world is losing out (as are you). Finally, it can help if you take that time off, acquire that perspective and know that you’re done with this phase of the work.</p>



<p>I just <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/the-book/">published a book</a>. It was released on Aug 16. I’m very proud of it, but there were times when I was just plain sick of it. I ended up taking some time away from it and that helped me make sure it was the best book it could be.</p>



<p>When you are working through the final bits of a project, sit back and get that perspective. And then, ship it!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

                            <img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Daily-Chatting-770x501.jpg.webp" alt="banner">
                           	
                           	
                            
<p>Many people cheered when Facebook decided to take over the WhatsApp messenger. The new owner promised that personal data would remain private and protected from third parties’ interference.</p>



<p><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/why-is-secure-messaging-important-in-2020/"><em>Why Is Secure Messaging Important In 2020?</em></a><em> Read and protect yourself from each cyber threat!</em></p>



<p>Time passed by and the promise was gradually forgotten. Today, this has led to the need to change your messenger if you want to keep your personal data secure. Facebook’s developers just took away additional layers of privacy protection from the app. Their standard argument is that it’s for analytical data analysis.</p>



<p><em>We’ve already prepared the full-fledged analysis of WhatsApp. You can read </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/is-whatsapp-safe-and-secure/"><em>Is WhatsApp Safe and Secure</em></a><em> </em><em>and decide whether to use this messenger or not.</em></p>



<p>Now, the days when we could perfectly trust this app are behind us. Therefore, the issue of replacing WhatsApp has become urgent. People want to use a proper WhatsApp alternative.</p>



<p>Fortunately, today, there are many WhatsApp alternatives in which privacy is really respected. In this article, you can find several multi-tasking and secure tools for private messaging everywhere.</p>



<p><em>Read </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/tools/clash-of-the-titans-telegram-vs-whatsapp-vs-utopia/"><em>Clash of The Titans: Telegram vs WhatsApp vs Utopia</em></a><em> and choose the best messaging app for secure communication.</em></p>



<h3>WhatsApp alternative list</h3>



<p><a href="https://u.is/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong><em>Utopia</em></strong></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Utopia.png.webp" alt="Best messaging app" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Utopia.png.webp 333w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Utopia-300x170.png.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px"></figure>



<p>Utopia is an anonymous platform that has a lot of built-in tools: instant messenger (uMessenger), secure file sharing (uMail), anonymous browser (Idyll), crypto container (uWallet) and more.</p>



<p>Utopia is a <a href="https://utopia.fans/networks/the-story-behind-the-clear-advantages-of-decentralization/">decentralized</a> ecosystem that is based on <a href="https://utopia.fans/networks/the-backbone-of-the-internet-what-is-a-p2p-network/">a peer-to-peer</a> architecture. In other words, it does not have a single server for storing data. Instead, Utopia creates a separate server for each user. Access to it is via a private key that is generated at the stage of anonymous registration.</p>



<p>For protection, the ecosystem uses multi-level encryption based on an elliptical curve and 256-bit AES. This method reliably protects and stores files.</p>



<p>uMessenger provides encrypted messages transfer. It can be either text or voice messages, and you can add different media files or attach stickers to messages. The messenger has a built-in function for creating private chats and channels. Everything is anonymous and uncensored.</p>



<p><a href="https://hoccer.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong><em>Hoccer</em></strong></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Hoccer.png.webp" alt="Hoccer WhatsApp alternative" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Hoccer.png.webp 200w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Hoccer-150x150.png.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></figure>



<p>Hoccer is a German messenger that is becoming popular all over the world. This is due to the high degree of security and anonymity of each user. It uses end-to-end encryption method for data protection.</p>



<p>Data encryption includes absolutely all messages and files: images, audio and video, contacts, messages, and geolocation. Hoccer does not limit the size or format of files to be transmitted. However, a call function is not provided in the app.</p>



<p>Registration is anonymous: users do not enter personal data when logging in. The app does not request a phone number, email address, etc.</p>



<p>The user may include further protection by using a password. IOS users can also take advantage of another additional feature: the app will take a picture of unauthorized persons who want to get access to the account.</p>



<p><strong><em><u><a href="https://app.element.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Element</a></u></em></strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Element.jpg.webp" alt="Element WhatsApp alternative"></figure>



<p>This app focuses on calls, conferences, and a lot of other advanced actions. Also, Element Instant Messenger is focused on data privacy. The application is based on the Matrix protocol, and it has a very good reputation in the field of communication security.&nbsp; In addition, it uses an open source code that is constantly being upgraded to achieve maximum security.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/whats-the-difference-between-open-source-vs-closed-source/"><em>Open Source vs Closed Source</em></a><em>: what to choose for reliable protection of users’ data? Read the article and make the right choice.</em></p>



<p>Here is a list of privacy features of the app:</p>



<ul><li>No phone numbers. Users don’t need to specify personal phone numbers to start using the messenger.</li><li>End-to-end encryption. It is used while sending and receiving messages. But the user should enable the feature manually (it doesn’t work by default).</li><li>Control over message history. Users can make adjustments to the message history.</li></ul>



<p>Element is available on popular mobile platforms, and it also helps to send and receive any type of file. It is possible to forward both minuscule .txt files and entire movies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The perfect organization and successful choice of communication technologies make the app one of the most secure messengers.</p>



<p><a href="https://threema.ch/en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong><em>Threema</em></strong></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Threema.png.webp" alt="Threema WhatsApp alternative" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Threema.png.webp 512w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Threema-300x300.png.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Threema-150x150.png.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure>



<p>Threema is a Swiss application for instant messaging between people. It uses E2E encryption for each transmitted message. Moreover, all messages will be deleted from the server after reading.</p>



<p>The only way to manage contacts and groups is from the source device. This function is blocked for the server. When contacts have been synced, Threema anonymously transfers them and encodes all data.</p>



<p>As a reliable WhatsApp alternative, it does not store metadata that includes the sender and receiver of the message. In other words, the level of data privacy is higher than its competitors.</p>



<p>The servers are located in Switzerland: this assures the privacy and security of using this application for communication.</p>



<p><a href="https://wire.com/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong><em>Wire</em></strong></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wire.png.webp" alt="Wire WhatsApp alternative" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wire.png.webp 466w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wire-300x295.png.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px"></figure>



<p>Wire is a fairly new messenger. It was released in 2014 by a Swiss company. But the entire message exchange process takes place via German servers.</p>



<p>Wire is based on E2E encryption with Whisper systems. It stores metadata anonymously, like Telegram. However, this function can be disabled here.</p>



<p>In addition, there is a voice-over-IP function that allows making group calls, like on Skype. All incoming and outgoing calls are protected from listening and surveillance. That is, unlike WhatsApp, the app encrypts each voice and video call.</p>



<p><em>Did you hear about the </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/data-leak-of-telegram-user-base/"><em>Data Leak of Telegram User Base</em></a><em>? We are shocked too! Read about the massive data leak in our blog.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wickr.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong><em>Wickr Me</em></strong></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wickr-Me.png.webp" alt="Wickr Me WhatsApp alternative" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wickr-Me.png.webp 320w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wickr-Me-300x300.png.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Wickr-Me-150x150.png.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"></figure>



<p>Wickr Me is a popular messenger that is actively used to send important data by journalists, leaders of countries and other people who have really serious secrets.</p>



<p>Wickr Me uses a phone number for authorization. There are also various useful features, like emoticons or stickers.</p>



<p>The app does not save personal contacts on its own servers. Wickr Me does not store metadata and completely erases messages at the user’s request (without the possibility of recovery).</p>



<p>The app is free, contains no ads, and supports the most secure encryption technologies. It is a really decent alternative to WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>



<p>WhatsApp has gained real popularity among users. Everybody thought that it was a perfect app that met all privacy standards. Under Facebook’s management, the service has further developed. It has added a lot of useful features that have made WhatsApp more competitive among other apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, recently Facebook has turned the app into an advertising platform. And if you don’t want to leak your data to companies and constantly watch ads, you should consider changing your messenger.</p>

10 September 2020</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crust.tech/">Crust Technology</a>, the leading open-source Low-Code Development platform and Salesforce alternative, is being funded by the European Commission’s <a href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/">Next Generation Internet</a> initiative <strong>to</strong> <strong>deliver the <a href="https://cortezaproject.org/">Corteza</a> platform as a federated cloud solution for record sharing</strong>. Crust, the founder and full-time maintainer of the Corteza Project, will enable the platform to share select components of data layer or entire data models, on a one-to-many or many-to-many basis. The new features will allow business data, but also open data sets created by public sector organisations and academia to be shared more easily.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?resize=300%2C84&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="84" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?resize=300%2C84&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?resize=1030%2C290&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?resize=768%2C216&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?resize=705%2C198&amp;ssl=1 705w, https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?resize=450%2C127&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/www.crust.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NGI-zero-logo.png?w=1241&amp;ssl=1 1241w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>Among other features, Corteza provides a decentralised cloud alternative to the likes of Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics365. Unlike these expensive competitors, Corteza can be self-hosted, maintained and customised from top to bottom by organisations – granting full sovereignty and control to both organisations and end users. The Corteza platform is used by well-known corporations, Fortune 1000 businesses, and large-scale public institutions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>We are delighted to have been given this opportunity by the European Union NGI Zero Programme</em>” <strong>says Niall McCarthy, CEO of Crust Technology and Chair of the Corteza Project.</strong> “<em>Our goal is to deliver federated clouds where the user and administrator experience looks, feels and operates like centralised clouds, but which is in practice underpinned by a more equitable, decentralised architecture of cloud peers.</em>”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Much recent work on decentralised systems has focused on peer-to-peer use cases rather than cloud-to-cloud sharing at scale</em>” <strong>says Michiel Leenaars, co-ordinator of the NGI Zero Discovery fund.</strong> “<em>But of course organisations need to share a lot of data too, and that data changes all the time. We don’t want thousands of stale copies of data lingering around. The new functionality of Corteza developed within the project will make it possible for even small organisations to share complex data as equals in a standardised manner. Just like you can follow a social media account, you will be able to maintain a single origin of data with all the security and privacy benefits. The new web standard, ActivityPub, subsequently enbles this data to be used across hundreds or even thousands of places on the internet in near realtime. This represents an interesting step forward for organisations wishing to collaborate, while also wanting to simplify their own setup and protect the privacy of their valuable users.</em>”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Corteza Federation will resolve the need for high quality, standards-based collaboration with the need for cloud digital and data sovereignty demanded across Europe and beyond</em>” <strong>adds McCarthy.</strong> “<em>Delivered in the modern, high-performance computing languages of Golang and Vue.js, much of Crust’s efforts will also focus on ensuring that the Corteza user experience (UX) is everything organisations expect and more from competitive cloud technology.</em>”</p></blockquote>
<p>Corteza Federation will be available for release in December 2020. A full suite of mock-ups can be viewed on <a href="https://cortezaproject.org/corteza-federation-previews">https://cortezaproject.org/corteza-federation-previews</a>.</p>

I didn't, so I wrote one with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, and you're about to read it. These are the tools we’ve been using for a while and we recommend.</p><p>In a <em>Choose your own adventure </em>fashion: if you want to learn about the security concepts we’re going to refer to, such as encryption and hashing, <a href="https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/privacy-security-roundup" target="_blank">jump to part 1</a>. Otherwise, enjoy your read 😉</p><h2>Online security and anonymity</h2><h3><a href="https://protonvpn.com/secure-vpn" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a></h3><p><strong>What it does</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>ProtonVPN makes your connection go through one or several servers before reaching its destination, which makes it very complex for someone to discover your IP address, or match online activities to your IP address. An IP address is a network’s unique identifier provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider), whether it’s from a mobile data plan or an at-home router.</p></li><li><p>Each session generates its own encryption key.</p></li><li><p>Another interest of VPNs is the ability to channel your traffic via other countries. Don’t hesitate to check privacy laws there. For instance, ISPs in <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/internet-privacy-laws-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">the United States</a>, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/new-cybersecurity-law-companies-china-will-store-connecting-ip-address-six-months/" target="_blank">China</a>, and <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/internet-privacy-laws-in-france" target="_blank">France</a> are required to hand logs over if the government asks for them. <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/comparison-of-internet-privacy-laws" target="_blank">Here</a>’s an interesting comparison among 13 countries.</p></li><li><p>Proton VPN is open source.</p></li><li><p>The company is regularly vocal about protecting journalists and activists, as well as freedom of speech. 50% of their July and August revenue from Hong Kong is to be donated to <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/hongkong/" target="_blank">2 organisations</a> expected to make a ‘meaningful impact on democracy and rule of law for Hong Kongers’.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why you might want to use it</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They prevent their users’ connection and history from being handed over to any third party.</p></li><li><p>Your Internet Service Provider doesn’t know what websites you visit.</p></li><li><p>You can browse the Internet from different countries.</p></li><li><p>Using your true IP address, governmental authorities in most countries can require ISPs to provide them with the identity of whoever subscribed to the associated Internet plan.</p></li></ul><h3><a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a></h3><p><strong>What it does</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Brave is an open source web browser that <a href="https://brave.com/features/" target="_blank">blocks most invasive ad trackers</a>. It’s like having AdBlock or uBlock, but you don't have to install anything on top of your browser. You can configure it to adapt it to your specific needs.</p></li><li><p>It's built on top of Google’s open source version of Chrome: Chromium. As a result, most browser extensions built for Google Chrome automatically work on Brave.</p></li><li><p>Brave (amongst other goodies) supports the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a> network which allows you to limit the possibilities of disclosure and tracking of your IP addresses.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why you might want to use it</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Brave is great if you want a hassle-free privacy-oriented browser - please note it isn't foolproof, nothing is. You will be tracked by some, but at least you'll block most identifiable trackers.</p></li><li><p>You can use it on Windows, MacOS, GNU/Linux, iOS and Android.</p></li><li><p>It’s one of the simplest ways to connect to the Tor network.</p></li></ul><h3><a href="https://everestpipkin.github.io/image-scrubber/" target="_blank">Image scrubber</a></h3><p><strong>What it does</strong></p><p>Image scrubber removes Exif data from your images and allows you to paint over them. It’s made by <a href="https://twitter.com/everestpipkin/status/1266936398055170048" target="_blank">@everestpipkin</a>.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif" target="_blank">Exif</a> is an image and sound format that contains extensive metadata. With Exif, your photos - whether taken with a smart device or a regular digital camera - can include:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Exact GPS location</p></li><li><p>Date and time your photo was taken</p></li><li><p>Information on your device: unique ID number, manufacturer, model</p></li><li><p>Camera settings: compression, orientation, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, whether the flash was used, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Here’s the information displayed by Image scrubber from a random shot I just took. Yes, all of this is embedded in your photo.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599477789054_6130"><div>

The location data can be very precise, and even include your phone’s orientation at the time of the photo, via the GPSImgDirection tag.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Painting over faces and any identifying details can also protect you. Just make note that covering a zone seems safer than blurring it, as blurring could be reversed - with varying accuracy.</p></li><li><p>It is free software (under MIT license).</p></li><li><p>It’s a web tool, you don’t need to download anything to use it. It’s perfect to be used on the fly.</p></li></ul><h2>Passwords and authentication</h2><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" target="_blank"><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong></a></h3><p><strong>What it does</strong></p><p>MFA is a way to verify identity, 2FA meaning there are strictly two factors needed.</p><p>The 3 main types of authentication factors are:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Something I know</em>: any type of password, code, information</p></li><li><p><em>Something I am</em>: biometrics</p></li><li><p><em>Something I own</em>: a specific object or device</p></li></ul><p>For instance, if you withdraw money at an ATM, you combine something you own (your card) with something you know (your code).</p><p><strong>Why you might want to use it</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Multi-factor authentication is an additional layer of security compared to single-factor authentication. It's some kind of safety net in case someone has your password and wants to break into your account.</p></li><li><p>MFA can also be an interesting protection against credential stuffing attacks.</p></li></ul><h3><a href="https://lesspass.com/" target="_blank">LessPass</a></h3><p><strong>What it does</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>LessPass is an open source tool created by <a href="https://twitter.com/guillaume20100" target="_blank">@guillaume20100</a>.</p></li><li><p>Given several parameters, it provides you with strong and customisable passwords.</p></li><li><p>It works like a hashing tool: it uses the URL you are on, your username/email, a (possibly unique) strong password and a few settings (length, symbols, numbers, etc.) to generate your hard-to-guess unique password.</p></li><li><p>It’s a stateless tool, meaning that nothing is stored, and therefore nothing can be stolen. I (Clo) have been using it for nearly 3 years, and I enjoy the philosophy and simplicity of statelessness.</p></li><li><p>LessPass is available as a browser extension, a website and an Android application.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why you might want to use it</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The specific advantage of LessPass is that you only have 1 password to remember for all your accounts, while also being protected against evil hackers (brrr) who might break into your password vault, because *pause for dramatic effect* there is no vault. Thus, there is no vault to break into. Unstoppable. We love it.</p></li><li><p>It’s highly customisable, as you can see in the screenshot below.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599479537382_5684"><div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero">Velero</a> is an open source tool to safety back up, recover, and migrate Kubernetes clusters and persistent volumes. It works both on premises and in public clouds.</p>

<p>Velero components are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Command line interface</li>
  <li>Kubernetes server application</li>
</ul>

<p>Velero is a convenient backup tool for Kubernetes clusters that compresses and backs up Kubernetes objects to object storage. It also takes snapshots of your cluster’s Persistent Volumes using your cloud provider’s block storage snapshot features, and can then restore your cluster’s objects and Persistent Volumes to a previous state.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we’ll set up and configure the velero command line tool on a local machine, and deploy the server component into our Kubernetes cluster. We’ll then deploy a sample Nginx app and a Redis cluster that uses Persistent Volume for data and then simulate a disaster recovery scenario</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article. The last published version is: <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/tag/v1.5.0-beta.1">v1.5.0-beta.1</a></p>

<p>However, to avoid stability problems, we are going to install the latest stable version: v1.4.2</p>




<p><strong>Velero Uses Cases</strong></p>

<p><strong>source:</strong> www.cncf.io</p>




<div><div><pre><code>• Backup and restore of kubernetes objects
    ◦ Uses Kubernetes Discovery API
    ◦ Does not need to talk directly to etcd
    ◦ Backups stored in Cloud Object Storage

• Backup and restore persisten volumes
    ◦ Uses cloud provider snapshots APIs
    ◦ Restic support for file system backups
</code></pre></div></div>




<p><strong>Backup/restore applications and Persitent Volumes</strong></p>

<p>In order to demonstrate the capabilities of Velero for disaster recovery, I have a Nginx pod running with a Persistent Volume on AWS using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/storage-classes.html">GP2 storageclass</a></p>

<p>Checking our app and the PV inside kubernetes:</p>






<p>Below we can see the Persistent volume on AWS:</p>


<p>
<img src="https://www.wecloudpro.com/assets/img/velero/pv.png" alt="persistent-volume">
</p>

<p>Let’s gather the Nginx logs stored on the Persistent Volume (noted the timestamp):</p>

<p>We can see the timestamp for the logs generated are:</p>

<p><strong>Velero Install and Prerequisites</strong></p>

<p>The prerequisites for having velero working and be able to store backup on AWS S3 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AWS S3 bucket: kubernetes.test.velero</li>
  <li>Set IAM permissions for velero</li>
  <li>Install and configure velero</li>
</ul>

<p>let’s go over the step by step.</p>

<p><strong>Create AWS S3 bucket (if you don’t have one already):</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>Velero requires an object storage bucket to store backups in, preferably unique to a single Kubernetes cluster (see the FAQ for more details). Create an S3 bucket, replacing placeholders appropriately:
BUCKET=kubernetes.test.velero
REGION=us-east-1
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --region $REGION \
    --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=$REGION
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Set Permissions for Velero:</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>aws iam create-user --user-name velero
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Attach policies to give velero the necessary permissions:</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat &gt; velero-policy.json &lt;&lt;EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {

                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:CreateVolume",
                "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {

                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

<div><div><pre><code>aws iam put-user-policy \
  --user-name velero \
  --policy-name velero \
  --policy-document file://velero-policy.jso
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Create an access key for the user:</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>aws iam create-access-key --user-name velero
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Create a Velero-specific credentials file (credentials-velero) in your local directory:</strong></p>

<p>Add below content to a new file. Replace with the proper values of the AWS CLI Credentials. Name it as <code>credentials-velero</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[default]
aws_access_key_id=&lt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;
aws_secret_access_key=&lt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Install Velero Client on your local computer</strong></p>

<p>I am running a Linux Debian based OS. Therefore I am going to show the steps to run on this OS.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/download/v1.4.2/velero-v1.4.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzvf velero-v1.4.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv velero-v1.4.2-linux-amd64/velero  /usr/local/bin/velero

velero install \
    --provider aws \
    --use-restic \
    --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.1.0 \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --backup-location-config region=$REGION \
    --snapshot-location-config region=$REGION \
    --secret-file ./credentials-velero

</code></pre></div></div>





<p><strong>Validate Velero installation</strong></p>

<p><code>kubectl get all -n velero</code></p>


<p>
<img src="https://www.wecloudpro.com/assets/img/velero/velero-install.png" alt="velero-install">
</p>

<p><strong>BACKUP &amp; RESTORE</strong></p>

<p>Let’s see now how velero actually works. We are goign to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backup an application based on label.</li>
  <li>Delete a namespace where we have this application running.</li>
  <li>Restore all components (namespace, deployment, service, Persistent Volume etc..) of the application using velero.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>velero backup create nginx-backup --selector app=nginx
velero backup describe nginx-backup --details
</code></pre></div></div>






<p>Below we can see all components are backed up an stored in our AWS s3 bucket:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.wecloudpro.com/assets/img/velero/backup-of-components.png" alt="velero-install">
</p>

<p>Now I am going to delete the entire namespace simulating a disaster and tne recovery everything using velero:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl delete namespace nginx-example

kubectl get deployments --namespace=nginx-example

velero restore create --from-backup nginx-backup

kubectl get deployments --namespace=nginx-example

kubectl get pvc --namespace=nginx-example

kubectl get services --namespace nginx-example
</code></pre></div></div>






<p>As we could see during the whole process, we were able to make a backup of the various stateless and statefull Kubernetes components and save them in an Amazon S3 bucket.</p>

<p>For those who have clusters running on premises and AWS S3 is not an option. The Object Storage <a href="https://min.io/">Minio</a> Open Source service can be used as an option.</p>

<p>Below I wanted to share gew URLs for different cloud provider plugins that can be usefull:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/velero-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">velero plugin for DigitalOcean</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws">velero plugin for AWS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp">velero plugin for GCP</a></li>
</ul>

It’s been a fun project for many, but one thing I didn’t expect was the number of people wanting to make their own.  While I documented all the parts, I never thought about how much it would cost others to recreate it, and it was very tough for some to assemble with all of the soldering.</p><p>To help newcomers and beginners, today I am releasing the Raspberry Pi Quick Kit.  It is far simpler, cheaper, and easier to produce.  There are only three 3D printed parts, and they should be able to print easily on most user-friendly printers.  I am also releasing for sale the three featured in this article on my site at <a href="https://back7.co/store/">https://back7.co/store .</a>  They are limited production, so no further prints are guaranteed.  Before breaking down how they’re assembled, let me introduce you to them:</p><h2><strong>RPQK: Orange</strong></h2><p>With hints of 80’s electronics, this is the first “color” project for a Cyberdeck that I’ve released on the site.  <a href="https://back7.co/store/raspberry-pi-quick-kit-orange-edition">Available for sale here</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598321492228_15362"><div>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>8</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>I’m always a little suspicious of job specs looking for the so-called <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role. They often mention a vast variety of duties and responsibilities. </p>



<blockquote><p>Are they hiring for a single role or a whole team?</p></blockquote>



<p>Roles having <em>DevOps</em> in their title hardly share the same meaning. They often have something in common, though. They try to cover for what traditionally would have been the specialization of different professionals.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong: cross-functional expertise is definitely important. But I don’t think <em>DevOps</em> means replacing a multitude of specialization with a single role. Different specializations like Operations, Security, Testing, Development, Product Management and so on, are vast and require specific knowledge. </p>



<p>I think the key differentiator of successful <em>DevOps</em> organizations is that they enable effective collaboration. They have as clear <em>North Star</em> the goal to deliver value to the end user.</p>



<p>Overall, I don’t think we should be talking about a <em>DevOps Engineer</em>, but rather about <em>DevOps</em> culture in organizations.</p>



<p>But let’s take a step back first.</p>



<h2>What does DevOps mean, really?</h2>



<p>I tweeted my own definition of DevOps some time ago.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DevOps is a highly condensed way of referring to the combination of practices that aim at shortening the software development life-cycle, increase the feedback opportunities and facilitate continuous improvement and experimentation.</p>— Alessandro Diaferia (@alediaferia) <a href="https://twitter.com/alediaferia/status/1279460637341560833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><em>DevOps</em> organizations incentivise different specialities to collaborate. The intrinsic existing tension between Dev, making changes to the system, and Ops, wanting to keep the system stable, dissolves. The greater good is now <em>the value stream</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>A stable system that delivers nothing is as useless as an unstable system that keeps offering new functionality.</p></blockquote>



<p>Dev and Ops understand the importance of working together to maximise this flow to figure out which bets worked out and which ones didn’t. </p>



<p>Organizations that embrace the <em>DevOps</em> mindset can be more effective than the competition at experimenting with new functionality. They quickly validate their assumptions, activating and deactivating functionality by flipping a switch on a dashboard.</p>



<p>Incidents become an opportunity for learning rather than a chance of blaming someone.</p>



<p>In general, <em>DevOps </em>organization learn to adapt and evolve to any situation.</p>



<p>Overall, I think there shouldn’t be a single <em>DevOps</em> role but, rather, a set of specific specialities collaborating effectively.</p>



<p>This ideal view of the terminology, though, might sometimes clash with the reality of the job market. Companies willing to attract the best talent with the most current skills may end up advertising for roles that are counterproductive in the context of DevOps principles.</p>



<p>But let’s have a look at a few interesting job specs.</p>

<h2>What are companies looking for?</h2>



<p>Let’s read through a few excerpts from job specs I found out there in the wild.</p>



<h3>The flexible problem solver</h3>



<blockquote><p>[…] Devops Engineers are IT professionals who collaborate with software developers, system operators and other IT staff members to manage code releases. They cross and merge the barriers that exist between software development, testing and operations teams and keep existing networks in mind as they design, plan and test. Responsible for multitasking and dealing with multiple urgent situations at a time, Devops Engineers must be extremely flexible. […]</p><cite>A job spec on the internet</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is one of those classic examples where the organization believes that the DevOps principles should be delegated to a single team.</p>



<p>The spec mentions the myriad of duties that are responsibility of the <em>Devops Engineers</em> in the company. A <em>Devops Engineer</em> is expected to <em>“multi-task and deal with multiple urgent situations at a time”</em>. Therefore, they <em>“must be extremely flexible”</em>.</p>



<p><em>Multitasking</em> and dealing with multiple urgent situations at a time is, for sure, likely to happen anywhere: I don’t think this should be a peculiarity of a role in an organization. On the contrary, a healthy environment empowers every engineer to handle urgent situations and <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">learn from them</a>.<mark id="annotation-text-54d7a912-f939-4d9c-8c35-b5876683f83c"></mark></p>



<hr>



<p>Coming across this role, I’d think that the organization is not really trying to adopt DevOps practices. <mark id="annotation-text-9ee4ee73-52fa-44d6-b856-3c9ba17dd0f4"></mark>Instead of encouraging people to collaborate and improve, they’re building a dedicated team to throw issues and urgent situations at.</p>



<p><mark id="annotation-text-d4681dd9-2adf-49b8-b88c-e4c6a256a1e7"></mark> This job spec would be a big red flag for me.</p>



<h3>The productivity booster</h3>



<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer combines an understanding of both engineering and coding. A DevOps Engineer works with various departments to create and develop systems within a company. From creating and implementing software systems to analysing data to improve existing ones, a DevOps Engineer increases productivity in the workplace.</p><cite>Another job spec on the internet</cite></blockquote>



<p>In a <em>DevOps</em> organization engineers <em>do</em> work with various departments. But what’s the point then of  having a dedicated <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role? Do the other type of engineers not work with the various departments of the organization? Do non-DevOps Engineers not analyse data and improve existing systems? Additionally, the job spec claims that <em>a DevOps Engineer increases productivity in the workplace</em>. How? Does it radiate productivity?</p>


	
	


<h3>The Release Manager… but <em>DevOps</em>!</h3>



<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer works with developers and the IT staff to oversee the code releases. […] Ultimately, you will execute and automate operational processes fast, accurately and securely.</p><cite>My favourite so far</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is quite a condensed one but the release aspect mentioned in it strikes me as particularly interesting.</p>



<p>I tend to separate the concept of <em>deployment</em> from the one of <em>release</em>. Users experience product updates governed by a release policy that may or may not be the same as the deployment policy. This really depends on the strategy of the organization.</p>



<p>Regardless of this distinction, though, I believe that constraining the capability of delivering value to the end user to a specific role undermines the agility of an organization.</p>



<p>The teams should be able to continuously release code into production. Mechanisms such as <em><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flags</a></em> should control the release of functionality. This means that the code in production doesn’t necessarily activate upon deploying it, making it possible for the organization to control when the functionality actually reaches the user.</p>



<p>In general, a deployment should be a non-event: nothing special, just another merge into the main branch that causes code to end up in production.</p>



<p>In a fast-paced world like the one we live in an organization shouldn’t constrain itself by requiring dedicated engineers to release new functionality. Modern environments require companies to always be experimenting. Organizations should empower non-technical teams to run experiments, analyse data and autonomously decide when to <em>release</em> new functionality. All of this, ideally, shouldn’t require <em>ad hoc</em> intervention from a specific engineer.</p>



<p>Job specs like this one feel like they’re trying to repurpose the role of the <em>Release Manager</em> to keep up with the latest trends by just changing a few words.</p>



<p>I don’t think release management goes away in a <em>DevOps</em> organization. Rather, the <em>Release Management</em> becomes ensuring that the rest of the organization can be autonomous at releasing. Achieving this means investing in automation and internal tools for the whole company.</p>



<h3>A Platform Engineer. But <em>cooler!</em></h3>



<blockquote><p>The DevOps Engineer will be a key leader in shaping processes and tools that enable cross-functional collaboration and drive CI/CD transformation. The DevOps Engineer will work closely with product owners, developers, and external development teams to build and configure a high performing, scalable, cloud-based platform that can be leveraged by other product teams.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is the <em>least bad</em> of the job specs I’ve encountered. It describes a set of responsibilities that usually pertain to a Platform or Infrastructure Team. Most of these teams often get renamed to DevOps Team and their members become DevOps Engineers for <em>fashion</em> reasons.</p>



<p>The Platform Engineering team is the key enabler for organizations that want to embrace the DevOps principles. But thinking that they only pertain to a specific team will hardly result in a successful journey.</p>



<p>This team will surely be responsible to build the relevant infrastructure that enables the other teams to build on top but they can’t be left alone in the understanding and application of those principles.</p>



<p>Developer teams will need to become autonomous at adopting and making changes to those systems; they will need to understand the implications of their code running in production; understand how to recognize if the system is not behaving as expected and be able to action to restore it.</p>



<p>Equally, the Product team should spend time understanding what new important capabilities derive from adopting DevOps practices. Code continuously flowing into production behind feature flags, containerization technologies, improved monitoring and alerting, <em>et cetera</em>, open endless opportunities.</p>



<p>Improved user experience and experimentation opportunities, for example, are an important asset to leverage to remain competitive.</p>

<h2>What should companies be looking for?</h2>



<p>We’ve just gone through a few job specs that look for variations of a <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role and I’ve outlined what aspects I think are flawed in those roles. But what should companies look for, then?</p>



<p>Before blindly starting to hire for roles driven by industry fashion trends, organizations should rather invest in understanding what’s holding them back from being <em>DevOps</em>.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/">Unicorn Project</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim">Gene Kim</a> mentions the <em>Five Ideals</em> of successful DevOps organizations.

			<p>These days your primary means of listening to music if likely from an app on your phone. So how do you get the music from your phone to your laptop or desktop that has better speakers?</p>
<p>The answer is to use Bluetooth and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a>. PulseAudio is the modern sound implementation on the Linux desktop. It runs as a sound server and takes sound inputs such a microphone or your browser playing a YouTube video and directs this sound to outputs such as your Laptop’s speakers.</p>
<p>PulseAudio can take the audio from a Bluetooth connection and route it to your laptop’s speakers and is very simple to get running.</p>
<p>First, install the PulseAudio Bluetooth modules. On ArchLinux this is called <code>pulseaudio-bluetooth</code> and on Ubuntu/Debian it is called <code>pulseaudio-module-bluetooth</code>.</p>
<p>After you have installed this package open the following file:</p>
<pre><code>/etc/pulse/system.pa
</code></pre><p>And add the following couple of lines:</p>
<pre><code>load-module module-bluetooth-policy
load-module module-bluetooth-discover
</code></pre><p>Then, as your regular user, restart PulseAudio:</p>
<pre><code>$ pulseaudio -k
$ pulseaudio --start
</code></pre><p>And you’re all set!</p>
<p>All you need to do is to pair your phone and your computer and start playing something on your phone and it will play through your computer’s speakers.</p>

<p><strong>Physicists at the University of Basel have developed a minuscule instrument able to detect extremely faint magnetic fields. At the heart of the superconducting quantum interference device are two atomically thin layers of graphene, which the researchers combined with boron nitride. Instruments like this one have applications in areas such as medicine, besides being used to research new materials.</strong></p>

        <p>To measure very small magnetic fields, researchers often use superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDs. In medicine, their uses include monitoring brain or heart activity, for example, while in the earth sciences researchers use SQUIDs to characterize the composition of rocks or detect groundwater flows. The devices also have a broad range of uses in other applied fields and basic research.</p>

<p>The team led by Professor Christian Schönenberger of the University of Basel’s Department of Physics and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute has now succeeded in creating one of the smallest SQUIDs ever built. The researchers described their achievement in the scientific journal <em>Nano Letters</em>.</p>

<h4><strong>A superconducting ring with weak links</strong></h4>

<p>A typical SQUID consists of a superconducting ring interrupted at two points by an extremely thin film with normal conducting or insulating properties. These points, known as weak links, must be so thin that the electron pairs responsible for superconductivity are able to tunnel through them. Researchers recently also began using nanomaterials such as nanotubes, nanowires or graphene to fashion the weak links connecting the two superconductors.</p>

<p>As a result of their configuration, SQUIDs have a critical current threshold above which the resistance-free superconductor becomes a conductor with ordinary resistance. This critical threshold is determined by the magnetic flux passing through the ring. By measuring this critical current precisely, the researchers can draw conclusions about the strength of the magnetic field.</p>

<h4><strong>SQUIDs with six layers</strong></h4>

<p>“Our novel SQUID consists of a complex, six-layer stack of individual two-dimensional materials,” explains lead author David Indolese. Inside it are two graphene monolayers separated by a very thin layer of insulating boron nitride. “If two superconducting contacts are connected to this sandwich, it behaves like a SQUID – meaning it can be used to detect extremely weak magnetic fields.”</p>

        <p>In this setup, the graphene layers are the weak links, although in contrast to a regular SQUID they are not positioned next to each other, but one on top of the other, aligned horizontally. “As a result, our SQUID has a very small surface area, limited only by the constraints of nanofabrication technology,” explains Dr. Paritosh Karnatak from Schönenberger’s team.</p>

<p>The tiny device for measuring magnetic fields is only around 10 nanometers high – roughly a thousandth of the thickness of a human hair. The instrument can trigger supercurrents that flow in minuscule spaces. Moreover, its sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the distance between the graphene layers. With the help of electrical fields, the researchers are also able to increase the signal strength, further enhancing the measurement accuracy.</p>

<h4><strong>Analyzing topological insulators</strong></h4>

<p>The Basel research team’s primary goal in developing the novel SQUIDs was to analyze the edge currents of topological insulators. Topological insulators are currently a focus of countless research groups all over the …</p></div></div></div></article></div></section></div>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. Today, we’re going to have a conversation about hardware, and in particular about how you can take the tools that come out of the world of chip design and apply them to a much broader space of problems than people typically think they can be applied to. And I’m joined in this conversation by Andy Ray.</p>

<h2 id="031">0:31</h2>

<p>Hello, Ron, good to be chatting with you.</p>

<h2 id="033">0:33</h2>

<p>Andy is a longtime veteran of the hardware industry. He spent over a decade building real shippable hardware designs, working on things like modems and video codecs. And along that time, he also did a lot of interesting work exploring and eventually designing his own alternative languages for expressing hardware designs. The final one was called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml">Hardcaml</a>, which is a hardware design language embedded inside <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, which itself is the primary programming language we use here at Jane Street. And that work actually led him to us. And today he works here and leads Jane Street’s hardware design team. And so, to start with Andy, maybe you can tell us a little bit about why hardware is useful for a technology organization and an organization like ours, and what advantages it has over traditional software-style approaches?</p>

<h2 id="123">1:23</h2>

<p>Sure. So hardware allows you to build customized architectures for a specific problem, which can be tuned to trade off, at a very fine level, lots of things like performance, and cost and power usage. That lets you design a range of different products. Whereas with a CPU, you’re very much more limited in the software world to the CPU design that can meet the performance of the problem domain. I think the sorts of problems that it can solve are very, very broad. And you can see that just because well, a CPU is a hardware design, in fact. And you can create all sorts of hybrid designs with multiple CPUs or digital signal processors or custom hardware blocks that make up your final solution. So I think that’s why hardware exists, why it will always exist. It’s the fact that you can build architectures entirely suited to your problem domain that optimize along these sort of areas.</p>

<h2 id="230">2:30</h2>

<p>That description on the face of it sounds awesome. And in fact, it sounds from what you said so far, strictly superior to writing software. I don’t think that’s quite true. Can you see more about what the downsides are of operating inside of a hardware context?</p>

<h2 id="243">2:43</h2>

<p>Oh, my goodness, yes, there are a lot. So it is fundamentally this: hardware designs are much, much more difficult to write than equivalent software. So all that flexibility in choosing, you know, the architecture for your problem domain, you actually have to implement that. In software, you have reams and reams of support libraries that either your organization has developed or that you can pull in from open source or that you can go and purchase. To some extent that infrastructure works in hardware with the idea of intellectual property suppliers. They’re basically just companies who supply a hardware design for you to integrate into your system. That’s actually the job I used to do when we were developing video codecs.</p>

<h2 id="327">3:27</h2>

<p>Yeah. And just to interrupt for a second though, that was a bit of terminology that really confused me when I first encountered the hardware world. When people in hardware say, “IP,” they mean something like when a software person says “library.”</p>

<h2 id="338">3:38</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="339">3:39</h2>

<p>Which is to say some component that somebody else wrote that you get to integrate. Except in this case, the component is a bundle of wires that you kind of plop into your design rather than something that looks more like a module or library.</p>

<h2 id="351">3:51</h2>

<p>Yeah, that’s right. I don’t know why that terminology came about, but it’s just always been called IP when you buy hardware library design. There’s some sort of infrastructure there for buying external blocks to integrate with your hardware. It’s a vastly smaller ecosystem than we have in software. It’s vastly more expensive. There is in the last maybe ten years more of an open source community around providing hardware blocks that you can integrate. But it’s still absolutely miniscule compared to software. And then just the process of writing hardware is slow and detailed. And I’m gonna say difficult. I’m not so sure it is really technically that difficult. It’s just that it’s so detailed, and you’re dealing with such big systems that it becomes a real problem trying to manage the complexity of all these very simple bits that sit together.</p>

<h2 id="449">4:49</h2>

<p>Right, I think of that as one of the paradoxes of hardware: hardware is in the micro, in many different ways, simpler than software.</p>

<h2 id="456">4:56</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="457">4:57</h2>

<p>The thing that you’re generating in a hardware design is essentially some layout of the circuit, the individual gates and wires that connect them. And it’s some kind of fairly static graph that represents the structure of the computation, and is converted into, when you actually get one of these fabricated, actual bits of material laid out on a physical surface. And understanding how those individual pieces work, at least logically how they work, leaving the physics aside, is relatively simple. But then having a big design that does a lot of these things, is enormously hard to reason about.</p>

<h2 id="532">5:32</h2>

<p>It is and unfortunately, the abstraction tools we have, they take us some way. So you know, you talked about a chip design, which you can think of as a layout of just two things really, lots of lots of NAND gates (a Boolean AND function with the output NOTed) and metal wires that connect them together. And it’s interesting because NAND is a universal Boolean function. Any other Boolean function can be computed with the NAND function. That’s not true of AND, for example, you can’t create an OR with an AND, but you can create it with a NAND. And they are like, I think sixteen Boolean functions, and four of them are universal. I think NAND and NOR are quite often like the basis of technology (NOR being an OR gate with the output inverted). We don’t actually think about writing circuits at the level of just interconnected NAND gates. An interesting aside, I believe the first ARM processor was basically designed that way. But actually even lower, they were drawing the transistors for the NAND gates in like just a graphics package. That’s how they created the very first ARM processor. But that’s not how they do it now. So we’re a little bit above that: we work with a tool called a synthesizer, and it takes a slightly more abstract notion of a hardware design in which we can think about components like adders and multiplexers. And the job of the synthesizer will be to turn those components into the actual low level hardware components for the chip, which might be NAND gates if you’re doing an ASIC, it might be look-up tables for an FPGA. But that being said, it’s not massively above building it with NAND gates. But really a lot of the industry just works at this sort of level of putting together these macros, which represent adders and multiplexers, and multipliers and registers and just wiring them together and getting them to form some function.</p>

<h2 id="738">7:38</h2>

<p>So you were talking there about ASICS and FPGAs. Can you just quickly explain what those are.</p>

<h2 id="743">7:43</h2>

<p>An ASIC is a custom-made chip that can perform a single function. In contrast, an FPGA is a reprogrammable chip that can be programmed to perform many different functions.</p>

<h2 id="757">7:57</h2>

<p>Got it. So when you talked about what the advantages are of hardware, you talked about how by having much more control, you get to really optimize the things you care about via power consumption or performance or latency or whatever it is of the, of the, system. Can you put a little bit of meat on the bones of that? What is the scale of the improvements that you can get by taking something that you might do in software and moving it into a hardware design?</p>

<h2 id="825">8:25</h2>

<p>It’s obviously going to depend on the sort of problem you’re trying to solve. But you know, an area I know really well, video coding. I used to work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264</a> a lot and there was just a really good software implementation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264">x264</a>, which was almost entirely written in assembly, using the SSE instructions, which is a vector instruction set on the x86 processor. And it could just about manage like real-time 1080p on modern Intel processors of the time, which were like four gigahertz processors. In order for it to achieve that sort of performance, you had to turn off lots of lots and lots of codec features. If you’re willing to go non-real-time, you could turn on all sorts of features that would compress it better. There’s an extremely large standard for H.264 that I used to read a lot, and there’s a lot of features on that thing, but you just can’t do them all. And so we used to target different markets, there was like, a sort of low-end video codec, which could fit in smaller FPGAs, could be used for like internet based communication. And there was like really high-end video codecs, which were built over multiple FPGAs, and had a really high end feature set, and was used for professional-grade encoding. So that’s the sort of video that you get over your satellite link or over your cable link. That bitstream is compressed as much as it possibly can be so they can fit more channels into that link. We didn’t have to compromise so much on the features to do that with hardware, we could pick the features that made the difference that got us to the bit rate, and they could run in real time. And you just couldn’t do that real time in software. You know, in that world, you’re looking at an order of magnitude more computation being done by these FPGAs. But these sort of things can scale massively. They’re like chips, which do packet processing, for example. So the idea here is you’ve got a switch and you want to do packet processing to detect threats in those packets to route …</p></div></div>

		<div>
		<p>Checked exceptions have always been a controversial feature of the Java language.</p>
<p>Advocates claim they ensure checking &amp; recovery from failures. Detractors say “catch” blocks can almost never recover from an exception, and are a frequent source of mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Java 8 and lambdas are here. Are checked exceptions becoming obsolete in the Java world?<span id="more-174"></span></p>
<h3>The Intent of Checked Exceptions</h3>
<p>In the mid 90’s, James Gosling at Sun came up with a new language.</p>
<p>At the time, C++ programming required every single function return to be checked for error. He decided there had to be a better way, and built the concept of “exceptions” into Java.</p>
<p>The intent of <strong>checked exceptions</strong> was to locally flag, and force developers to handle, possible exceptions. Checked exceptions have to be declared on a method signature, or handled.</p>
<p>This was intended to encourage software reliability &amp; resilience. There was an intent to “recover” from contingencies – predictable outcomes other than success, such as InsufficientFundsException on attempting a payment. There was less clarity, as to what “recovery” actually entailed.</p>
<p><strong>Runtime exceptions</strong>&nbsp;were also included in Java. Since null pointers, data errors, and illegal states/ accesses could occur anywhere in code, these were made subtypes of RuntimeException.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions can be thrown anywhere, without requiring to be declared, and are much more convenient. But would it be correct to use them instead?</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The crucial point here, is that runtime &amp; checked exceptions are functionally equivalent.&nbsp;There is no handling or recovery which checked exceptions can do, that runtime exceptions can’t.</p>
<p>The biggest argument against “checked” exceptions is that most exceptions can’t be fixed. The simple fact is, <strong>we don’t own the code/ subsystem that broke.&nbsp;</strong>We can’t see the implementation, we’re not responsible for it, and can’t fix it.</p>
<p>Particularly problematic were the areas of JDBC (SQLException) and RMI for EJB (RemoteException). Rather than identifying fixable contingencies as per the original “checked exception” concept, these forced pervasive systemic reliability issues, not actually fixable, to be widely declared.</p>
<p>For any method, the possibility of failure includes all sub-methods called by it. Potential failures accumulate up the call tree. Declaring these on method signatures no longer offers a specific &amp; local highlight for the developer to watch for – declared exceptions spread throughout the call tree.</p>
<p>Most EJB developers have experienced this – declared exceptions become&nbsp;required on methods through the tier,&nbsp;or entire codebase. Calling a method with different&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;requires dozens of methods to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Many developers were told to catch low-level exceptions, and rethrow them again as higher (application-level) checked exceptions. This required vast numbers – 2000 per project, upwards – of non-functional “catch-throw” blocks.</p>
<p>Swallowing exceptions, concealing the cause, double logging, and returning ‘null’/ uninitialized data all became common. Most projects could count 600+ mis-coded or outright errors.</p>
<p>Eventually, developers rebelled against the vast numbers of “catch” blocks, and the source of error these had become.</p>
<h3>Checked Exceptions – incompatible with Functional Coding</h3>
<p>And then we get to Java 8, with its new <i><b>functional programming&nbsp;</b></i>features – such as lambdas, Streams, and function composition.</p>
<p>These features are built on generics – parameter &amp; return types are genericized, so that iteration &amp; stream operations ( <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>) can be written which perform a common operation, regardless of item type.</p>
<p>Unlike data types, however, declared exceptions can’t be genericized.</p>
<p>There is no possibility in Java to provide a stream operation (like, for example, &nbsp;<code>Stream.map</code>) which takes a lambda declaring some checked exception, &amp; transparently passes that same checked exception to surrounding code.</p>
<p>This has always been a major points against checked exceptions – all intervening code, between a throw and the receiving “catch” block, is forced to be aware of exceptions.</p>
<p>The workaround, of “wrapping” it in a RuntimeException, conceals the original type of the exception – rendering the exception-specific “catch” blocks envisaged in the original concept useless.</p>
<p>Finally we can capture Java’s new philosophy in a nutshell, by noting that none of the new “functional interfaces” in Java 8 declare checked exceptions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Exceptions in Java provided major benefits in reliability &amp; error-handling over earlier languages.&nbsp;Java enabled reliable server &amp; business software, in a way C/ C++ never could.</p>
<p>Checked exceptions were,&nbsp;in their original form, an attempt&nbsp;to handle&nbsp;<i>contingencies</i>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<i>failures</i>.&nbsp;The laudable goal was to highlight specific predictable points (unable to connect,&nbsp;file not found,&nbsp;etc) &amp; ensure developers handled these.</p>
<p>What was never included in the original concept, was to force a vast range of systemic &amp;&nbsp;unrecoverable failures to be declared. These <em>failures</em>&nbsp;were never correct to be&nbsp;declared as checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Failures are generally possible in code, and EJB, web &amp; Swing/AWT containers already cater for this by providing an outermost “failed request” exception-handler. The most basic correct strategy is to rollback the transaction &amp; return an error.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions allow any exception-handling possible with checked exceptions, but avoid restrictive coding restraints. This simplifies coding &amp; makes it easier to follow best practice of&nbsp;<a href="http://wikijava.org/wiki/10_best_practices_with_Exceptions#Throw_early_catch_late" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://wikijava.org']);">throw early, catch late</a>&nbsp;where exceptions are handled at the outermost/ highest possible level.</p>
<p>Leading Java frameworks and influences have now definitively moved&nbsp;away from checked exceptions. Spring, Hibernate and modern Java frameworks/&nbsp;vendors&nbsp;use only runtime exceptions, and this convenience is a major factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>Personalities such Josh Bloch (Java&nbsp;Collections framework), Rod Johnson, Anders Hejlsberg (father of&nbsp;C#), Gavin King&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn&nbsp;(JodaTime)&nbsp;have all come out against checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, in&nbsp;Java 8,&nbsp;lambdas are&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundamental step forward.&nbsp;These language features&nbsp;abstract the “flow of control” from functional operations within. As we’ve seen, this makes checked exceptions &amp; the requirement to “declare or handle immediately” obsolete.</p>
<p>For developers, it is always important to pay attention to reliability &amp; diagnose likely points of failure (contingencies) such as file open, database connection, etc. If we provide good error messages at this points, we will have&nbsp;created&nbsp;self-diagnosing software – a pinnacle of engineering achievement.</p>
<p>But we should do this with unchecked exceptions, and if we have to rethrow, should always use RuntimeException or an app-specific subclass.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn says, if your projects&nbsp;are&nbsp;still using or advocating checked exceptions, your skills are 5-10 years out date.&nbsp;Java&nbsp;has moved&nbsp;on.</p>
<p><strong>How are you dealing with exceptions &amp; reliability? Add your thoughts now.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Thousand of companies and indie developers are involved in the ever-growing market of mobile apps. Competition is growing. The mobile market is thriving.<br></p><p>The job of a successful app publisher is hard. He needs to listen to the users' feedback, develop and publish new updates, watch out for the competition, and manage marketing campaigns. In other words, monitoring and optimizing everything on an ongoing basis is crucial. Managing resources, especially with a 30% revenue cut from the platform providers like Apple or Google, is essential.<br></p><p>One often unused optimization and growth strategy due to its complexity is dynamic pricing.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>What is dynamic pricing?</h2><p>Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy that is all about flexible prices. Flexible prices mean that they respond to market conditions.<br></p><p>In general, prices adjust according to the demand of the market. The best-known example of this concept is the pricing of flight tickets or the gas price from your favorite gas station. Both businesses price their products via demand. If the demand is high, the prices will be high.<br></p><p>Another well-known approach is a dynamic price based on the buyers' location. We often see this with physical goods. A good example is the price of an iPhone, which costs more in Germany than in the USA.<br></p><p>Compared to static pricing, dynamic pricing's main advantage is that the seller meets the demand of a market with a better price. This way, the seller avoids opportunity costs. In other words, he makes more money. He knows what to charge because he knows what buyers are willing to spend.</p><figure id="w-node-0f9bad4ca291-a9a5bdca"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb96fb2022bac7d41a5bbdd/5f562fa22220c9c4c11836fe_mage-dynamic-pricing.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Sweet spot of dynamic pricing</figcaption></figure><h2>Adapting dynamic pricing for mobile apps<br></h2><p>Dynamic pricing is currently only available in a very simplified version in the app stores. Real dynamic pricing is mostly practiced with custom build software by very large and successful app companies like Tinder or Spotify.&nbsp;Most apps that use some dynamic pricing mostly follow two approaches: prices based on time and user location.</p><p>The idea of prices based on time is simple. Since we are talking about the mobile environment, the app provider knows its customer. He can segment between users who bought and users who did not buy after a specific period. If a user falls into the group of people who did not purchase anything, he will receive an offer with discounted prices. What a great catch!&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem with that strategy is that it will just work if the app publisher can reach the potential customer. Most people delete apps after a few minutes of using an app or days after installing it. In that case, in-app popups will not work. Push notifications might work out if the app is still on the user's phone. Sending emails will probably be the best approach, but the app publisher needs to know the email address for that to work. Also, the user needs to open the email, and please don't get me started on conversion rates of emails.</p><p>We can see that there is a massive overhead of technology needed to make this strategy work. An app publisher would need to develop an internal popup, a push notification, and an email system. That costs a lot of money.</p><p>The second approach is to base dynamic pricing on the buyers' location. A good example is segmentation by country.</p><p>Since the seller has some knowledge of his target market's purchasing power, he can set the base price in that market. Certain other countries receive discounts relative to that base price. Other countries with a higher purchasing power than the default market may receive a higher price relative to the base price. This abstract description could look something like the image below.</p><figure id="w-node-32a53b335696-a9a5bdca"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb96fb2022bac7d41a5bbdd/5f47cc92d2fa4a3315898a8c_mage-diffrent-in-app-purchase-prices.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Different prices based on location</figcaption></figure><p>‍<a href="#"><br></a>For this kind of pricing, a high intense and expensive market research is needed. App publishers need to evaluate markets and determine the regional prices. This process can take months, and the worst part, the optimum is never fixed due to ever-changing market conditions. Spoiler alert: it's a continuous process.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>The pain in adapting dynamic pricing for mobile apps</h2><p>Both ways (dynamic pricing based on time or location) represent excellent solutions. The only drawback is that both strategies are from enormous complexity.</p><p>App publishers may need to spend many resources on the development. They may need to hire market researches, data scientists, and other pricing specialists to implement a self-improving pricing system. This is why dynamic pricing is currently only seen in unicorn apps: It is simply expensive.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>A fast and cost effective way to add dynamic pricing to mobile apps</h2><p>We developed and continuously improving a system that can bring dynamic pricing to any mobile app. As of this time of writing, we invested five months of development time, so you do not have to.</p><p>Mage is a "dynamic pricing as a service" solution for in-app purchases. Mage is scalable and usable for all kinds and sizes of apps. Due to the way app stores work at the moment, Mage works just for apps that use in-app purchases as a monetization strategy.</p><p>With Mage, app publishers can adopt dynamic pricing without the need for expensive market research, data science, and development teams.</p><p>Mage makes manually interpreting reports as well as generating and implementing new prices a thing of the past. Mage is fully automated and continuously fed with new data from the App Publishers' target markets. Mage is affordable and offers a free plan for young apps, who are just starting their journey. The integration of Mage takes around two to eight hours, depending on the apps complexity.</p><figure id="w-node-93b7b888b407-a9a5bdca"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb96fb2022bac7d41a5bbdd/5f47ccc48af7b24655e46a33_mage-dynamic-pricing-solution.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Mage Dynamic Pricing As A Service Solution</figcaption></figure><h2>How to dynamically price in-app purchases</h2><p>First, you need to sign up via our <a href="https://www.getmage.io/">Website</a>. After that, you need to add your app, product groups, and products to our dashboard. Once you configured everything, Mage will give you instructions on setting up your app store products. The last step is implementing the simple, lightweight, and open-source Mage SDK. Currently, our mobile SDKs are available for iOS, Android, and React-Native Apps.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>JAMStack is Fast. Fast for Development and to deliver ultra Fast websites.</p><p>To develop with JAMStack, one of the ways is Static Site Generation.</p><h2 id="static-site-generators-ssg-">Static Site Generators (SSG)</h2><p>SSGs are the tools which will take the data from any data source and generate Static HTML pages.</p><p>Static Sites are way faster than any dynamic site because:</p><ul><li>No content generated on runtime, which means no time spent in this process</li><li>The server doesn’t have to match for the dynamic URLs. HTML files delivered straight to the browser without any Route/URL matching</li><li>As the content is Static, it will be cached for longer time</li><li>Again, being Static, the websites can be delivered through CDNs. This way users don’t have to wait very long for the response.</li></ul><p>And to build WebSites with SSGs, Eleventy (11ty) is fast and easy to use the tool.</p><hr><h2 id="eleventy-11ty-">Eleventy (11ty)</h2><p>11ty is a JavaScript alternative of Jackyl. It’s built with no-configuration in mind. Though, it supports many templating languages; for example MarkDown, Pug, Handlebars etc.</p><p>We will make a simple Blogging website with following features in consideration:</p><ul><li>Index Page with</li><li>Blog Intro</li><li>List of Posts</li><li>Blog Post page</li><li>Tags with Tag Index</li><li>Comments with Disqus</li><li>Deployed on Netlify</li></ul><p>First, we need to create a Project and add 11ty as the dev dependency, lets do that with following commands:</p><pre><code># make project directory
mkdir awesome-blog

# switch to the project directory
cd awesome-blog

# initialize the Node Project
yarn init -y

# Add 11ty as a dev dependency
yarn add -D @11ty/eleventy

# open VS Code in the directory
# (if you use VSCode and have set up CLI command)
code.
</code></pre><p>Now we edit the <code>package.json</code> file to add the following to the scripts:</p><pre><code>{
  ...
  "scripts" : {
    "start" : "eleventy --serve"
  },
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>After adding <code>start</code> script in the package.json, launch <code>yarn start</code> on the root of your Project directory from CLI.</p><p>Now that 11ty is up and running, we need to add some content to see it building.</p><p>By default, 11ty will output the generated HTML files in <code>_site</code> directory.</p><p>Let's go ahead and create out index page with <code>index.md</code> file in the root of the project as:</p><pre><code># Hello World
---
Welcome to the `awesome-blog`
</code></pre><p>Which will get generated as the following <code>body</code> in <code>_site/index.html</code>:</p><pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the &lt;code&gt;awesome-blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre><p>Well, that was super simple; and blank with no CSS. Let's try to add some Style by adding Bootstrap CSS.</p><p>But where do we add them? This is where layouts in the 11ty come into the play.</p><p>As the name suggests, Layouts are the Page Generator Templates where the data can be filled by selected page.</p><p>The layouts must be inside the <code>_includes</code> directory.</p><p>Lets try to make a Handlebar layout as <code>home.hbs</code> for the home page:</p><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="//stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body class="p-3"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    {{{content}}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>To use the above template, we need to add some context to our markdown file. We will add the context with the FrontMatter format inside the markdown.</p><p>FrontMatter is the data format go git more contextual data about the file. For a blog post, it can be title, tags etc. For a landing page, it can be with Sections, Images and other blocks of information.</p><p>For our markdowns, we will add <code>title</code> and <code>tags</code> in the front matter all the time and use it in our layouts.</p><p>So with decided FrontMatter, here is our <code>index.md</code>:</p><pre><code>---
layout: layouts/home.hbs
title: Hello World
tags: [intro, random, gif]
---
# Hello World

---

Welcome to the `awesome-blog`

Here we will add some awesome gifs rolling around the internet.

Starting with this:

![me thinking 'I can do this'](https://media.giphy.com/media/YTJXDIivNMPuNSMgc0/giphy-downsized.gif)
</code></pre><p>Now we have Title repeating two times, we will keep the FrontMatter and remove form the content of the markdown to make it as follows:</p><pre><code>---
layout: layouts/home.hbs
title: Hello World
banner: https://placeimg.com/1000/480/nature
tags: [intro, random, gif]
---
Welcome to the `awesome-blog`

Here we will add some awesome gifs rolling around the internet.

Starting with this:

![me thinking 'I can do this'](https://media.giphy.com/media/YTJXDIivNMPuNSMgc0/giphy-downsized.gif)
</code></pre><p>And with this, we will update our layout as following inside the <code>body</code>:</p><pre><code>&lt;body class="p-3"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
    {{#if banner}}
      &lt;img src="{{banner}}" alt={{title}} /&gt;
    {{/if}}
    {{#if tags}}
      &lt;div class="tags"&gt;
        {{#each tags}}
          &lt;div class="badge badge-dark"&gt;{{this}}&lt;/div&gt;
        {{/each}}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    {{/if}}
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    {{{content}}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre><p>Now with basics in mind, we want to make the blog posts and make all the posts listed on the homepage.</p><p>In 11ty, by default, the HTML files will be generated in the same directory structure as of the data file. &nbsp;And the URLs will be like the data file-names.</p><p>So, in our case, we can make all the <em>posts</em> inside the <code>posts</code> directory with post <code>slug</code> as the file-names</p><p>And our Markdown files will follow the following structure:</p><pre><code>/
├── index.md
└── web
    ├── hello-world.md
    ├── ...
    └── trip-to-new-york.md
</code></pre><hr><p>Now we need to add these post lists in the Home Page.</p><p>For this, let’s make a rough try making the data of post in the FrontMatter of the Home Page and create a new layout for it.</p><p>For the list of post, I will approach the data of front matter as follows:</p><pre><code>title: Home
posts:
- 0:
  title: Hello World
  url: posts/hello-World/
  banner: //source.unsplash.com/user/pankajpatel/1024x400
- 1:
  title: Random Post
  url: posts/random/
  banner: //source.unsplash.com/user/pankajpatel/likes/1024x400
</code></pre><p>And the layout can be change to the following:</p><pre><code>&lt;body class="p-3"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="m-5"&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;

    {{#if posts}}
      &lt;div class="row"&gt;
        {{#each posts}}
          &lt;a class="col mb-3 text-decoration-none" href={{this.url}} data-index={{@key}}&gt;
            &lt;article class="card" href={{this.url}} data-index={{@key}}&gt;
              &lt;img src="{{this.banner}}" class="card-img-top" alt="{{this.title}}"&gt;
              &lt;div class="card-body text-left"&gt;
                &lt;h1 class="card-title font-weight-light"&gt;{{this.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;small class="text-muted"&gt;Last updated 3 mins ago&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;
          &lt;/a&gt;
        {{/each}}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    {{/if}}
    &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre><p>But this FrontMatter data were prepared manually. What can we do to build it automatically?</p><p>It’s time to get our hands dirty with configuration files.</p><p>For 11ty, the config file is <code>.eleventy.js</code></p><p>In 11ty’s config file, &nbsp;there needs to be one exported function. This function accepts the current eleventyConfig.</p><p>The current eleventyConfig has some API methods to define different behaviours like:</p><ul><li>Adding/Modifying collection</li><li>Adding new filters</li><li>etc</li></ul><p>For us, the concerned part is to add a new collection for our posts and use this collection to list the posts on the homepage.</p><p>To get the collection of all the posts, we had created FrontMatter data <code>type</code>. And for all the posts, we set the <code>type</code> as <code>post</code></p><p>Now our 11ty config looks like the following:</p><pre><code>module.exports = (eleventyConfig) =&gt; {
  eleventyConfig.addCollection("posts", (collection) =&gt; {
    return collection.getAll().filter((item) =&gt; {
      return 'type' in item.data &amp;&amp; item.data.type === 'post'
    })
  })
}
</code></pre><p>Now with above added <code>posts</code> collection, we can update our homepage template as:</p><pre><code>&lt;body class="p-3"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="m-5"&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;

    {{#if collections.posts}}
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      {{#each collections.posts}}
      &lt;a class="col mb-3 text-decoration-none" href={{this.data.page.url}} data-index={{@key}}&gt;
        &lt;article class="card" href={{this.data.url}} data-index={{@key}}&gt;
          {{#if this.data.banner}}
            &lt;img src="{{this.data.banner}}" class="card-img-top" alt="{{this.data.title}}"&gt;
          {{/if}}
          &lt;div class="card-body text-left"&gt;
            &lt;h1 class="card-title font-weight-light"&gt;{{this.data.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;small class="text-muted"&gt;Last updated 3 mins ago&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      {{/each}}
    &lt;/div&gt;
    {{/if}}
    &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre><p>Now that our homepage and posts are ready, we can publish it.</p><p>To publish our site, first, we need a git repository and commit the changes.</p><pre><code>git init
echo "node_modules\n_site" &gt; .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 personal blog launch initiated"
</code></pre><p>Now you have committed the code on your local repo. You can create a repository on GitHub and add remote to your local repo. Then you can push your branch and it is available remotely.</p><p>Now it is time to publish our blog through this repository.</p><p>Following are the way to publish the website:</p><h3 id="publish-on-netlify">Publish on Netlify</h3><p>Netlify publish is a matter of a few clicks.</p><ul><li>Log into Netlify with Github from here: <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Netlify App</a></li><li>Click on <code>New Site from Git</code> button</li><li>Connect to your Github if not connected</li><li>Select the repo that you had before created</li><li>Netlify will detect the type of Project and will suggest a build command</li><li>Click on <code>Deploy Site</code></li><li>Yous site is deployed</li></ul><p>You can watch the following video to see the above steps in action:</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLulIIeYreo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/zLulIIeYreo">11ty on Netlify - YouTube</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="publish-on-github-pages">Publish on GitHub Pages</h3><p>To publish on GitHub pages, you need to add build script to your <code>package.json</code></p><p>You can do so by adding following line the scripts:</p><pre><code>{
  ...
  "scripts" : {
    "build" : "eleventy",
    "start" : "eleventy --serve"
  },
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>Now that the build script is added. We need to add <a href="https://time2hack.com/auto-publish-github-pages-github-actions/">GitHub action to Auto Publish our site to Github Pages</a>. Following is the YAML file placed at <code>.github/workflows/publish.yaml</code></p><pre><code>name: publish

					<div><p>We have been spending the last three months interviewing startups from London to ask them about how they are adapting to this new post-pandemic situation and the core principles they depend on to survive C-19. At the end of these interviews, we compiled their learnings into a documentary.&nbsp;</p><p>We will cover their experiences under five chapters: The first chapter is about<b> fragility versus agility</b>. Yes, startups are very agile but at the same time, they are very fragile due to lack of resources. The second one is how <b>doubling the burn rate doubles the runway</b>. The third chapter is about <b>bubbles of opportunity</b>. Some startups will discover those bubbles of opportunity and rise to the top whereas others will not and unfortunately drown. The fourth idea is about <b>the need to pivot for the new needs</b>, and this is only possible by a new type of collaboration; not just the collaboration between individuals, but collaboration between startups and other companies. Lastly, the fifth chapter is about <b>adapting to the new rules</b> and monetisation funding office space, how teams collaborate, how they develop products and more. Extremely exciting stuff.

					<div><p>1. There is an inherent tension between <b>agility and fragility</b>, just like some systems become less resilient as they become more efficient, startups are very agile which works in their favour, but they are at the same time very fragile due to the nature of how chasing next rounds of funding work.</p><p>2. The argument that has been embraced by most startups brings us to this quote:&nbsp;<b>“half the burn rate to double the runway”</b>. While this makes sense for many, it creates second-order effects that are difficult to navigate. Many startups rely on other startups as their customers, not to count the consultants and other service providers that work around startups.</p><p>3. There are always<b> bubbles of opportunity </b>and they act like pockets of air in what is otherwise a deep ocean of problems. Finding those bubbles mean prioritising short term ROI (return on investment) rather than the long term. Survival in times like this might depend more on commercial cunning than focusing on innovation with a possible future return.</p><p>4. The idea that startups should be <b>“Pivoting for new needs” </b>has also gathered a consensus. Some startups pull this off better than others and it comes down to the team itself. We love paying lip service to people and culture, but it usually remains a second or third priority. However, times like these test startups and teams and only those who invested in culture thrive.</p><p>5. The next chapter is that of <b>a new normal</b>. We don’t exactly know what it will look like, but as startups can piece together what the future will look like, they will be able to afford more risks and invest more heavily into the future.</p><p>Make sure to visit our <a href="https://youtube.com/startupsoflondon">Youtube Channel</a> for all the interviews. </p></div>

<p>An infinite amount of times I have found myself in desperate situations because I had no idea what was happening under the hood. And, for a lot of people in the computer vision community, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are like this. More or less, <strong>another black box in the pile</strong>.</p>

<p>However, in this tutorial, we will attempt to open the RNN magic black box and unravel its mysteries!</p>

<p>Even though I have come across hundreds of tutorials on LSTM’s out there, I felt there was something missing. Therefore, I honestly hope that <strong>this tutorial serves as a modern guide to RNNs</strong>. We try to deal with multiple details of practical nature. To this end, we <strong>will build upon their fundamental concepts.</strong></p>

<p>The vast application field of RNN’s includes <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Bitcon_prediction_LSTM/" target="_blank">sequence prediction</a>, activity recognition, video classification as well as a variety of natural language processing tasks. After a careful inspection of the equations, <strong>we will build our own LSTM cell to validate our understanding</strong>. Finally, we will make some associations with convolutional neural networks to maximize our comprehension. Accompanying code for this tutorial can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/u/0/d/1Rb8OiF-AZ_Y3uFj1O2S0IyocFMhHoTCV/edit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is true that by the moment you start to read about RNN’s, especially with a computer vision background, concepts misleadings start to arise. Less literally:</p>

<p>“Backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) does not magically make your network work. Batch normalization does not magically make it converge faster. <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) don’t magically let you “plug in” sequences</strong>. (…) If you insist on using the technology without understanding how it works you are likely to fail.” ~ <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrey Karpathy</a></strong> (Director of AI at Tesla)</p>

<p>The abstraction of RNN’s implementations doesn’t allow users to understand how we deal with the time dimension in sequences! However, by understanding how it works you can write optimized code and practice extensibility, in a way that you weren’t confident enough to do before.</p>

<p>Finally, a more holistic approach in RNN’s can be found on <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=r24KwW5qbBo&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fnlp-sequence-models" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sequence models from the Deep Learning specialization course</a> offered by Coursera.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-rnn-cell">A simple RNN cell</h2>

<p>Recurrent cells are neural networks (usually small) for processing <strong>sequential data</strong>. As we already know, convolutional layers are specialized for processing grid-structured values (i.e. images). On the contrary, <strong>recurrent layers are designed for processing long sequences</strong>, without any extra sequence-based design choice [1].</p>

<p>One can achieve this by connecting the timesteps’ output to the input! This is called sequence <strong>unrolling.</strong> By processing the whole sequence, we have an algorithm that takes into account the previous states of the sequence. In this manner, we have the <strong>first notion of memory</strong> (a cell)! Let’s look at it:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/understanding-lstm/rnn-cell-time-unfold.png" alt="rnn-cell-time-unfold">
<em>Visualization is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wiki</a></em></p>

<p>The majority of common recurrent cells can also process sequences of variable length. This is really important for many applications such as videos, that contain a different number of images. One can view the RNN cell as a common <strong>neural network with</strong> <strong>shared weights for the multiple timesteps.</strong> With this modification, the weights of the cell now have access to the previous states of the sequence.</p>

<p>But <strong>how</strong> can we possibly train such sequential models?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-back-propagation-through-time">What is Back-propagation through time?</h2>

<p>Most practitioners with computer vision background have little idea of what recurrency means. And it is indeed difficult to understand. Because the frameworks assume that you already know how it works. However, if you want to find an efficient solution to your problem, you should carefully design your architecture based on the problem.</p>

<p><strong>The magic of RNN networks that nobody sees is the input unrolling</strong>. The latter means that given a sequence of length N, you process the input into timesteps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We choose to model the time dimension with RNN’s, because we want to learn temporal and often long-term dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right now, it is true that convolutions cannot handle because they have a finite receptive field. Note that, in theory, you can apply a recurrent model in any dimension.</p>

<p>In terms of training an RNN model, the issue is that now we have a time-sequence. That’s why input unrolling is the only way we can make backpropagation work!</p>

<p>So, how can you learn a time-sequence? Ideally, we would like the memory (parameters) of the cells to have taken into account all the input sequences. Otherwise, we would not be able to learn the desired mapping. In essence, <strong>backpropagation requires a separate layer for each time step with the same weights for all layers</strong> (<strong>input unrolling)</strong>! The following image helps to understand this tricky idea.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/understanding-lstm/input-unrolling-and-backpropagation-through-time.png" alt="input-unrolling-and-backpropagation-through-time">
<em>Source: O’Reilly: hands-on-reinforcement-learning](Source: O’Reilly: hands-on-reinforcement-learning)</em></p>

<p>Backpropagation through time was created based on the pre-described observation. So, <strong>based on the chunked (unrolled) input, we can calculate a different loss per timestep</strong>. Then, we can backpropagate the error of multiple losses to the memory cells. In this direction, <strong>one can compute the gradients from multiple paths (timesteps) that then are added to calculate the final gradient</strong>. For this reason, we may use different optimizers or normalization methods in recurrent architectures.</p>

<p>In other words, we represent the RNN as a repeated (feedforward) network. More importantly, <strong>the time and space complexity to produce the output of the RNN is asymptotically linear to the input length (timesteps)</strong>. This practical bottleneck introduces the computational limit of training really large sequences.</p>

<p>In fact, a similar idea is implemented in practice when you have a small GPU and you want to train your model with a bigger batch size than your memory supports. You perform forward propagation with the first batch and calculate the loss. Afterwards, you repeat the same thing with the second batch and average the losses from different batches. In this way, gradients are <strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-that-gradients-are-accumulated-in-Pytorch-and-what-is-the-use-for-it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accumulated</a>.</strong> With this trick of the low budget machine learners, you basically perform a similar operation to backpropagation through time. Finally,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jfw8MuKwpI" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> siamese networks</a> with shared weights also roughly exploit this concept.</p>

<p>Let’s now see the inside of an LSTM [5] cell.</p>

<h2 id="lstm-long-short-term-memory-cells">LSTM: Long-short term memory cells</h2>

<h3 id="why-lstm">Why LSTM?</h3>

<p>One of the most fundamental works in the field was by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Greff et al. 2016</a> [4]. Briefly, they showed that <strong>the proposed variations of RNN do not provide any significant improvement in a large scale study compared to LSTM</strong>. Therefore, LSTM is the dominant architecture in RNNs. That’s why we will focus on this RNN variation.</p>

<h3 id="how-lstm-works">How LSTM works?</h3>

<p>We can write forever about what an LSTM cell is, or how it is used in many applications. However, the language of mathematics makes this world beautiful and compact for us. Let’s see the math. Don’t be scared! <strong>We will slowly clarify every term, by inspecting every equation separately</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we begin, note that in all the equations, the weight matrices (W) are indexed, with the <strong>first index being the vector that they process</strong>, while the <strong>second index refers to the representation</strong> (i.e. input gate, forget gate).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To avoid confusion and maximize understanding, we will use the common notation: <strong>matrices are depicted with capital bold letters while vectors with non-capital bold letters</strong>. For the element-wise multiplication, I used the dot with the outer circle symbol, referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hadamard product</a> [9] in the bibliography.</p>

<h3 id="equations-of-the-lstm-cell">Equations of the LSTM cell</h3>

<p>For \(\textbf{x}_t \in R^{N}\) , where N is the feature length of each timestep, while \(\textbf{i}_t,\textbf{f}_t,\textbf{o}_t,\textbf{h}_t,\textbf{h}_{t-1},\textbf{c}_t,\textbf{c}_{t-1},\textbf{b}  \in R^{H}\) , where H is the hidden state dimension, the LSTM equations are the following:</p><p>

\[\textbf{i}_t = \sigma( \textbf{W}_{xi} \textbf{x}_t + \textbf{W}_{hi} \textbf{h}_{t-1} + \textbf{W}_{ci} \textbf{c}_{t-1} + \textbf{b}_i)  \quad\quad(1)\]

\[\textbf{f}_t = \sigma( \textbf{W}_{xf} \textbf{x}_t + \textbf{W}_{hf} \textbf{h}_{t-1} + \textbf{W}_{cf} \textbf{c}_{t-1} + \textbf{b}_f) \quad\quad(2)\]

\[\textbf{c}_t = \textbf{f}_t \odot \textbf{c}_{t-1} + \textbf{i}_t \odot tanh( \textbf{W}_{xc} x_t + \textbf{W}_{hc} \textbf{h}_{t-1} + \textbf{b}_c ) \quad\quad(3)\]

\[\textbf{o}_t = \sigma( \textbf{W}_{xo} \textbf{x}_t + \textbf{W}_{h0} \textbf{h}_{t-1} + \textbf{W}_{co} \textbf{c}_{t} + \textbf{b}_o)  \quad\quad(4)\]

\[\textbf{h}_t = \textbf{o}_t \odot tanh(\textbf{c}_t) \quad\quad(5)\]

</p><p>The LSTM cell equations were written based on <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=lstm#torch.nn.LSTM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pytorch documentation</a> because you will probably use the existing layer in your project.</p>

<h3 id="equation-1-the-input-gate">Equation 1: the input gate</h3><p>

\[\textbf{i}_t = \sigma( \textbf{W}_{xi} \textbf{x}_t + \textbf{W}_{hi} \textbf{h}_{t-1} + \textbf{W}_{ci} \textbf{c}_{t-1} + \textbf{b}_i)\]

</p><p>The depicted <strong>weight matrices represent the memory of the cell</strong>. You see the input \(\textbf{x}_t\) is in the current input timestep, <strong>while h and c are indexed with the previous timestep</strong>. Every matrix <strong>W</strong> is a linear layer (or simply a matrix multiplication). This equation enables us to the following:</p>

<p>a) take multiple linear combinations of <strong>x</strong>,<strong>h</strong>,<strong>c</strong>, and</p>

<p>b) match the dimensionality of input <strong>x</strong> to the one of <strong>h</strong> and <strong>c</strong>.</p>

<p>The dimensionalities of <strong>h</strong> and <strong>c</strong> are basically the <strong>hidden states</strong> parameter in a deep learning framework such as PyTorch (<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=lstm#torch.nn.LSTM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LSTM Pytorch layer documentation</a>). For the old-school readers, <strong>hidden states</strong> were referenced in older literature as neurons, but now this term is deprecated.</p>

<p>Moving on, the bias term is part of the linear layer and is simply a trainable …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction: Why good commit messages matter</h2>

<p>If you browse the log of any random Git repository, you will probably find its commit messages are more or less a mess. For example, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commits/e5f4b49?author=cbeams">these gems</a> from my early days committing to Spring:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git log --oneline -5 --author cbeams --before "Fri Mar 26 2009"

e5f4b49 Re-adding ConfigurationPostProcessorTests after its brief removal in r814. @Ignore-ing the testCglibClassesAreLoadedJustInTimeForEnhancement() method as it turns out this was one of the culprits in the recent build breakage. The classloader hacking causes subtle downstream effects, breaking unrelated tests. The test method is still useful, but should only be run on a manual basis to ensure CGLIB is not prematurely classloaded, and should not be run as part of the automated build.
2db0f12 fixed two build-breaking issues: + reverted ClassMetadataReadingVisitor to revision 794 + eliminated ConfigurationPostProcessorTests until further investigation determines why it causes downstream tests to fail (such as the seemingly unrelated ClassPathXmlApplicationContextTests)
147709f Tweaks to package-info.java files
22b25e0 Consolidated Util and MutableAnnotationUtils classes into existing AsmUtils
7f96f57 polishing
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Yikes. Compare that with these <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commits/5ba3db?author=philwebb">more recent</a> commits from the same repository:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git log --oneline -5 --author pwebb --before "Sat Aug 30 2014"

5ba3db6 Fix failing CompositePropertySourceTests
84564a0 Rework @PropertySource early parsing logic
e142fd1 Add tests for ImportSelector meta-data
887815f Update docbook dependency and generate epub
ac8326d Polish mockito usage
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which would you rather read?</p>

<p>The former varies in length and form; the latter is concise and consistent.<br>
The former is what happens by default; the latter never happens by accident.</p>

<p>While many repositories’ logs look like the former, there are exceptions. The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master">Linux kernel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commits/master">Git itself</a> are great examples. Look at <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commits/master">Spring Boot</a>, or any repository managed by <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/commits/master">Tim Pope</a>.</p>

<p>The contributors to these repositories know that a well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate <em>context</em> about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves). A diff will tell you <em>what</em> changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you <em>why</em>. Peter Hutterer <a href="http://who-t.blogspot.co.at/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html">makes this point</a> well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can’t avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">reducing it</a> [as much] as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a result, <em>a commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven’t given much thought to what makes a great Git commit message, it may be the case that you haven’t spent much time using <code>git log</code> and related tools. There is a vicious cycle here: because the commit history is unstructured and inconsistent, one doesn’t spend much time using or taking care of it. And because it doesn’t get used or taken care of, it remains unstructured and inconsistent.</p>

<p>But a well-cared for log is a beautiful and useful thing. <code>git blame</code>, <code>revert</code>, <code>rebase</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>shortlog</code> and other subcommands come to life. Reviewing others’ commits and pull requests becomes something worth doing, and suddenly can be done independently. Understanding why something happened months or years ago becomes not only possible but efficient.</p>

<p>A project’s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his project’s log. It’s worth taking the time to learn how to care for one properly. What may be a hassle at first soon becomes habit, and eventually a source of pride and productivity for all involved.</p>

<p>In this post, I am addressing just the most basic element of keeping a healthy commit history: how to write an individual commit message. There are other important practices like commit squashing that I am not addressing here. Perhaps I’ll do that in a subsequent post.</p>

<p>Most programming languages have well-established conventions as to what constitutes idiomatic style, i.e. naming, formatting and so on. There are variations on these conventions, of course, but most developers agree that picking one and sticking to it is far better than the chaos that ensues when everybody does their own thing.</p>

<p>A team’s approach to its commit log should be no different. In order to create a useful revision history, teams should first agree on a commit message convention that defines at least the following three things:</p>

<p><strong>Style.</strong> Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation. Spell these things out, remove the guesswork, and make it all as simple as possible. The end result will be a remarkably consistent log that’s not only a pleasure to read but that actually <em>does get read</em> on a regular basis.</p>

<p><strong>Content.</strong> What kind of information should the body of the commit message (if any) contain? What should it <em>not</em> contain?</p>

<p><strong>Metadata.</strong> How should issue tracking IDs, pull request numbers, etc. be referenced?</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are well-established conventions as to what makes an idiomatic Git commit message. Indeed, many of them are assumed in the way certain Git commands function. There’s nothing you need to re-invent. Just follow the <a href="#seven-rules">seven rules</a> below and you’re on your way to committing like a pro.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#separate">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>
  <li><a href="#limit-50">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>
  <li><a href="#capitalize">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>
  <li><a href="#end">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>

  <li><a href="#why-not-how">Use the body to explain <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> vs. <em>how</em></a></li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code>Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="separate">1. Separate subject from body with a blank line</h3>

<p>From the <code>git commit</code> <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html#_discussion">manpage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, not every commit requires both a subject and a body. Sometimes a single line is fine, especially when the change is so simple that no further context is necessary. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code>Fix typo in introduction to user guide
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Nothing more need be said; if the reader wonders what the typo was, she can simply take a look at the change itself, i.e. use <code>git show</code> or <code>git diff</code> or <code>git log -p</code>.</p>

<p>If you’re committing something like this at the command line, it’s easy to use the <code>-m</code> option to <code>git commit</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git commit -m"Fix typo in introduction to user guide"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>However, when a commit merits a bit of explanation and context, you need to write a body. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code>Derezz the master control program

MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
and turns it back into a chess game.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Commit messages with bodies are not so easy to write with the <code>-m</code> option. You’re better off writing the message in a proper text editor. If you do not already have an editor set up for use with Git at the command line, read <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration">this section of Pro Git</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, the separation of subject from body pays off when browsing the log. Here’s the full log entry:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git log
commit 42e769bdf4894310333942ffc5a15151222a87be
Author: Kevin Flynn &lt;kevin@flynnsarcade.com&gt;
Date:   Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 1982 -0200

 Derezz the master control program

 MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
 This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
 and turns it back into a chess game.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And now <code>git log --oneline</code>, which prints out just the subject line:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git log --oneline
42e769 Derezz the master control program
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or, <code>git shortlog</code>, which groups commits by user, again showing just the subject line for concision:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git shortlog
Kevin Flynn (1):
      Derezz the master control program

Alan Bradley (1):
      Introduce security program "Tron"

Ed Dillinger (3):
      Rename chess program to "MCP"
      Modify chess program
      Upgrade chess program

Walter Gibbs (1):
      Introduce protoype chess program
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are a number of other contexts in Git where the distinction between subject line and body kicks in—but none of them work properly without the blank line in between.</p>

<h3 id="limit-50">2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters</h3>

<p>50 characters is not a hard limit, just a rule of thumb. Keeping subject lines at this length ensures that they are readable, and forces the author to think for a moment about the most concise way to explain what’s going on.</p>

                <div id="mobile-panel">
                    



<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>As of yesterday, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73996">Rust PR</a>
(which I had worked on) is merged into Rust nightly, and it has wide
implications on compiler errors.</p>
<p>In this post I describe the change and what to expect from it.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-full-paths-in-errors">The problem with full paths in errors</h2>
<p>A simple program such as the following, would result in a type error.</p>
<div><div><pre><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> a </span><span>= </span><span>vec![vec![</span><span>String</span><span>::from(</span><span>"a"</span><span>)]];
    </span><span>let</span><span> b </span><span>= </span><span>vec![</span><span>String</span><span>::from(</span><span>"b"</span><span>)];
    a </span><span>==</span><span> b;
}
</span></pre></div></div>
<p>The type error can be described as such: cannot compare between values of the
types <code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code>. Before the changes in the PR, this
was <em>almost</em> the first line of the error message, and the rest of the error
message gives us more details about traits:</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">old output</td></tr><tr><td><pre><span>error[E0277]: can't compare `std::vec::Vec&lt;std::string::String&gt;` with `std::string::String`
 --&gt; example.rs:5:7
  |
5 |     a == b;
  |       ^^ no implementation for `std::vec::Vec&lt;std::string::String&gt; == std::string::String`
  |
  = help: the trait `std::cmp::PartialEq&lt;std::string::String&gt;` is not implemented for `std::vec::Vec&lt;std::string::String&gt;`
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::cmp::PartialEq&lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;std::string::String&gt;&gt;` for `std::vec::Vec&lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;std::string::String&gt;&gt;`
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>It is surely noticeable that in the above error the greatest contribution to
cognitive burden is the full qualified paths (e.g. <code>std::vec::Vec</code>) of types
and traits. It has made a significant readability difference for many people.</p>
<h2 id="enter-path-trimming">Enter path trimming</h2>
<p>In the large majority of cases there would be only one <code>Vec</code> symbol and one
<code>String</code> symbol that is importable through the entire program being linked, for
all crates that are available.  Surely that there are crates existing that
define items named <code>Vec</code>, but they are rare, and the situation that the user
defines <code>Vec</code> is rare.</p>
<p>Considering the observation that the overlap between module namespaces is
rather minimal, we can do a uniqueness check that verifies that uniqueness
holds, i.e, that <code>Vec</code> and <code>String</code> are unique as items defined in the
compilation. Even if that's not the case, the compilation would still succeed
without any new warning. But for the unique symbols, we don't have to print the
entire path in warnings and errors, and we can thus trim it to the last
component - the symbol itself.</p>
<p>With trimming according to uniqueness, the following error is printed instead:</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">new output</td></tr><tr><td><pre><span>error[E0277]: can't compare `Vec&lt;String&gt;` with `String`
 --&gt; example.rs:5:7
  |
5 |     a == b;
  |       ^^ no implementation for `Vec&lt;String&gt; == String`
  |
  = help: the trait `PartialEq&lt;String&gt;` is not implemented for `Vec&lt;String&gt;`
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `PartialEq&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;` for `Vec&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;`
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>This behavior can be controlled using a new debug option <code>-Z trim-diagnostic-paths=false</code>, and it is enabled by default only for rustc
itself.</p>
<p>As for the toll it takes on the compiler, it is similar to the algorithm that
computes 'use suggestions' on errors caused by undefined identifiers. This
means iterating all importable symbols of the entire program or library being
linked. Since this may be heavy, we made sure it is only done in case there
are warnings or errors by the compiler. If that assertion is invalidated,
it's a bug, and you'd see a panic related to trimmed paths.</p>
<h3 id="trimming-considerations">Trimming considerations</h3>
<p>Trimming is done only relative to what the currently built crate does, so -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All the local definitions in the built crate are considered, regardless of
whether they are exported from it or not. This is different than how external
crates are treated, where only the externally visible and importable
definitions are taken into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trimming is considered between all crates including the one being built, so
if you define a <code>Vec</code> type anywhere in your crate, then <code>Vec</code> name will no
longer be considered unique because another <code>Vec</code> can be imported from
<code>std::vec</code> too, and thus the full paths of both types will be printed as
just as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because several glob imports (i.e. <code>use foo::*;</code>) can happen in a single
place, it wouldn't be clear which items they bring if we trim the paths that
are related to these items. Thus, glob imports cancel out the uniqueness of the
symbols that they import.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2>
<p>This change in behavior will probably go under some refinements and more
testing until it reaches stable Rust. There are expected follow ups, for
instance, to allow some ambiguity, as not all items are treated equal. For
example between the <code>Result</code> type alias in <code>std::io</code>, and the <code>Result</code> type
itself from <code>std::result</code>.</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>The change has been hard to maintain as a PR, as it affected more than 1000
unit tests. It has gone through several revisions until the implementation was
good.</p>
<p>Not being a frequent Rust compiler contributor, most of the code involved was
new to me, and it has been greatly instructive to rely on long-term members of the
Rust compiler team. There have been folks who were crucial in reviewing and so
I'd like to thank them — <a href="https://github.com/petrochenkov">Vadim Petrochenkov</a>,

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. The doc recommended I up the dosage, but I could see this would eventually lead me to a straitjacket.</p>



<p>Over the years I’ve tried different meds, various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as clinical depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and covid anxiety. My longest bouts of depression now last a day at most and even that doesn’t happen too often.</p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-09-11</p>
        
<p>I'm always a bit flabbergasted when I see how people test their code (especially with unit tests). Often I can't figure out a cohesive set of rules based on which the tests are written.</p>
<p>Testing seems to work from a pragmatic perspective, we have evidence it works, but different people define "testing" in different ways. I'm awfully afraid that what some people refer to as "testing" is completely unrelated to that unrigorous but pragmatic practice that saves us from production bugs.</p>
<h2>I - A contrived example</h2>
<p>To showcase my arbitrary formalism as it relates to testing, I think it's worthwhile to look at some cases:</p>
<h4>1)</h4>
<pre><code># Testing a multiplication function
func multiply(int a, int b) -&gt; int

func test_1():
  assert 2*5 == multiply(2,5)
  assert 10*12 == multiply(12,10)

func test_2():
  assert 10 == multiply(2,5)
  assert 120 == multiply(12,10)

func test_3():
  assert type(multiply(2,5)) == int
  assert type(multiply) == func(int,int)-&gt;int
</code></pre>
<h4>2)</h4>
<pre><code># Testing an image classification algorithm
func classify(arr[int] image) -&gt; str

func test_1():
  assert img_classification_nn(to_arr('cat.jpg')) == classify(to_arr('cat.jpg'))
  assert img_classification_nn(to_arr('dog.jpg')) == classify(to_arr('dog.jpg'))

func test_2():
  assert 'cat' == classify(to_arr('cat.jpg'))
  assert 'dog' == classify(to_arr('dog.jpg'))

func test_3():
  possible_targets = ['cat','cheta','tiger','dog','wolf','coyote','other']
  assert classify(to_arr('rand_img_1.jpg')) in possible_targets
  assert classify(to_arr('rand_img_2.jpg')) in possible_targets
</code></pre>
<p>For both examples, <code>test_1</code> obviously makes no sense. You're testing the functionality of a function using another function that does the same thing. If the function used to assert correct functionality is better (i.e. if <code>*</code> is better than <code>multiply</code> or <code>img_classification_nn</code> is better than <code>classify</code>), than one should simply use that function instead. If they are equally flawed, then the tests are redundant.</p>
<p>These kinds of tests are a theatrical performance to build up an illusion of quality. Usually spotted in enterprise-grade codebases and teams that harp on about TDD a lot, I'll classify these as <strong>redundant checks</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, <code>test_2</code> is more interesting, it's comparing the result of a function with what a human would expect the result of that function to be. Here I would argue the test makes sense for the <code>classify</code> function but not for the <code>multiply</code> function.</p>
<p>Computers are good at multiplying, humans are horrible at it. So testing this function against an arbitrary number of human answers is much more likely to reveal flaws with the human's answer rather than the computer's. Since the function is very simple, time would probably better spent reviewing the actual code to make sure it's error-free.</p>
<p>On the other hand, computers aren't very good at classifying images (though they are getting there), but humans are spot on. So using a human's answers to validate a vision algorithm makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>We'll call these types of tests <strong>human validations</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we get to <code>test_3</code>, which superficially seems less flawed than the other two. It's more of a sanity check than a test, we aren't checking the actual return value of the function in a given case, we are instead checking a higher-level behavior.</p>
<p>These tests are much more common in the codebases of dynamic languages, and for good reason. In our first example, we are just validating the signature of a function, something a compiler will implicitly do for us in any statically typed language.</p>
<p>In the second example, we are instead working around a limitation of our type system. We are checking if the result of our function (a string) is contained within 7 different values (the possible things our function should classify images as), which we could test implicitly by using a language that supports <code>enum</code> types and writing <code>classify</code> such that it returns an enum of those 7 classes.</p>
<p>Basically, these kinds of tests can be useful, but they are the kind of things a compiler can handle automatically when they are present they usually indicate a mistake in the language the programmer is using for the project. We'll call these <strong>compiler rules</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Obviously, this system is fairly arbitrary, it's just a conclusion I reached after looking at various codebases and talking with various people about their tests, but I find that it works quite well.</p>
<p>To re-iterate, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>redundant checks</li>
<li>human validation</li>
<li>compiler rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>II - Compiler rules</h2>
<p>Compiler rules are great, but it's a bad sign when they leak into your testing.</p>
<p>Some amount of compiler rules leaking into testing can't be helped. Until the advent of Rust and/or well-performing libraries for safe multi-threading, testing thread safety should have been a requirement in many codebases. Similarly, before modern type system and allocation techniques, one ought to assume various now-pointless memory checks might have fared well within a codebase (and, I assume, still do on some embedded devices).</p>
<p>Even more, switching to more modern languages and compilers is often a task much harder than just writing some tests, but I think these tests should be viewed as a cautionary sign against the language currently used. If they only cover a small but critical percentage of the codebase, everything is fine, if they cover most of it, it's an indicator of using the wrong compile-time tooling.</p>
<p>The one difficult thing about these tests might be spotting them, an inexperienced team might be writing loads of these tests without realizing there are better alternatives to the compile-time toolchain they are using which would replace the need for them.</p>
<h2>III - Redundant checks</h2>
<p>Redundant checks are often pointless busywork, but they can serve a valuable role in some cases.</p>
<p>The two main scenarios that come to mind are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Given two versions of the same function, one well-proven and one "experimental", where the "experimental" function has some benefits in terms of performance or generalizability, it seems reasonable to test the "experimental" function using the well-proven approach. Still, the overhead here is so severe I find it difficult to think of a real-world example where this applies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given two versions of the same function, one in a "new" codebase and one an "old" codebase, it makes sense to test the "new" version with the "old" version. In this sense, going back to compiler rules, redundant checks can be useful in the process of refactoring, especially for major changes like changing the language or the core framework upon which the project is built. However, this seems useful only as a "temporary" measure rather than a permanent fixture of a project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I'd wager that most tests falling in this category, as mentioned before, are there only as "filler" and indicative of a much bigger underlying problem of a team that engages in busywork. If I ever accepted such a test, I would require plenty of complimentary comments to explain why they exist and when they can be removed.</p>
<h2>IV - Human validation</h2>
<p>Human validation is the "sanest" type of testing one can perform, it can be replaced by good practices or good languages. The problem with human validation comes from the fact that in some cases human intelligence can't solve the problems the software is designed to solve or can't cover all the edge cases the software will encounter.</p>
<p>Take for example banking software. It's fairly easy to imagine what should happen with a piece of banking software that provided dozens of customers, hundreds of transactions, and a few regulatory restrictions. All the logic there can be written down into tests that validate our software. However, the software itself must scale to millions of customers, trillions of transactions, and thousands of regulatory restrictions. Something a human mind can't comprehend coherently in order to write the tests.</p>
<p>Still, banking software is an easy example, because the various components might be test-able and their limited logic might be fully comprehensible by a human, even accounting for all the edge cases. This is because the inputs to the software are very well defined, there are only so many things one can do with a banking API, a finite space which a human mind can explore exhaustively when properly broken down.</p>
<p>One real problem arises when we have software with a very broad and/or poorly define input and/or outputs spaces. A few examples of these would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrappers that distill information from a broad range of websites (e.g. the ones used by a search engine)</li>
<li>Machine learning algorithms meant to work on a broad range of data (e.g. a decision tree or a gradient boosting classifier implementation in a library like sklearn)</li>
<li>Any software that has to work well with user-provided code extensions (e.g. think a video game-like Skyrim that has to support mods)</li>
<li>Simulation software (e.g. physics simulations)</li>
<li>Creative software (e.g. multimedia editing &amp; creation, game engines)</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
</ul>
<p>One can separate these into components with input-output spaces that can be easily comprehended by the human mind, but some components that suffer from the above problems are bound to remain. It also introduces the problem of writing code separation in such a way that components can be easily tested, rather than with refactoring, extension, speed, or readability as the main concern.</p>
<h2>V - Human validation and cost</h2>
<p>Assuming that we've designed our software such that it has many human-comprehensible components, the issue of cost remains. Human-comprehensible is a vague term, there are many things which, given enough time, a person could write exhaustive tests for, but in practice, this often takes more time than we can allocate. Furthermore, in certain situations, even in the limited input&amp;output space scenario, it might still be easier to write the "generative" logic (the one that maps inputs to outputs) than to come up with mappings ourselves.</p>
<p>In certain cases, exhaustive validation can be done, but it can be …</p></div></div>

<p><span>September 11, 2020 in </span><span><a href="https://xitheon.com/category/news/" rel="category tag">News</a></span> </p></div><div>

<p>In an interesting and perhaps dangerous development, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced that it is seeking candidates who may be able to crack Monero’s privacy features in exchange for a bounty of a total of $625,000 USD, in an effort to utilize the method to unmask individuals behind Monero transactions.</p>
<p>Titled “Pilot IRS Cryptocurrency Tracing”, Notice ID <a href="https://beta.sam.gov/opp/3b7875d5236b47f6a77f64c19251af60/view?index=opp">2032H8-20-R-00500</a>, which was published on Sep 04, 2020 at 01:55 pm, acknowledges that agencies currently have limited tools and resources effective towards tracing privacy coin based transactions, specifically citing Monero &amp; Layer 2 network protocol –</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, there are limited investigative resources for tracing transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins such as Monero, Layer 2 network protocol transactions such as Lightning Labs, or other off-chain transactions that provide privacy to illicit actors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Monero is mentioned a total of 11 times in the associated <a href="https://beta.sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/bb0247a3accc46beb2901af74b78438d/download?api_key=null&amp;token=">Request for Proposal (RFP)</a>, with notable mentions in it’s goals of this cracking challenge,</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://xitheon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rfp.png" alt="" width="976" height="564" srcset="https://xitheon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rfp.png 976w, https://xitheon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rfp-300x173.png 300w, https://xitheon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rfp-768x444.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px"></h3>

<p>The IRS will pay $500,000 for the completion of a working concept for a utility that is able to crack targeted transactions and wallets, as well as a second payment of $125,000 once a pilot program is successfully completed and approved by the agency. Those interested in applying have until September 16th, 2020 to do so.</p>
<p>One would be inclined to believe that far more money is laundered and shuffled around using cash (fiat) than it is Monero or other privacy coins, however the IRS doesn’t seem to think so, and it’s willing to shell out big bucks for a beta. Monero allows users to send funds to another party without the sender or receiver address and the amount being revealed, much like cash but fairly minted.</p>
<p>Something doesn’t seem right about this. Perhaps it’s the fact that all of this suggests that the IRS would go as far as cracking into a safe in your home to see where you stand financially. Would they? Should the IRS have the ability to see all of the information otherwise obfuscated even in instances where the parties involved in a transaction are not under active investigation?</p>
<p>Now it’s not being suggested here that people should not pay taxes, if you claim your citizenship then certainly you should also pay it’s taxes if it’s in your lawful interest to do so. What’s questionable however is the intrusion of privacy. The IRS does not exclusively need the ability to uncover the sender, receiver or amount of a transaction to determine if someone is not paying taxes, they can allocate resources towards tracking that within their own confines.</p>
<p>I know I know, “If you have nothing to hide” right? well if that’s the case let’s just stop using doors and curtains too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>From 2004 to 2018, I was a freelance web developer and worked on dozens of projects in spaces including tech, retail, advertising, community engagement, software development, and more. These spaces have taught me a lot about how the internet has become the center of our lives and the people who run them. </p><h2></h2><p>Freelance web development is when a software engineer performs a web development service on-demand, without committing to a full-term engagement. Developers working in freelance are self-employed and have the flexibility to organize their contracts and schedule at their own discretion. These contracts are an agreement between the freelancer and the client, to perform the job at agreed-upon terms. It can be an empowering experience that allows you to have an impact on a variety of projects.</p><p>If you're thinking of becoming a freelance web developer or learning more about freelance, then this article is for you. In this post, I'll share with you the lessons that I've learned and how to have a great time as a freelancer. Moreover, I'll tell you how to work more effectively with clients, deal with complications, and what red flags to keep in mind. Here are the lessons that I've learned in my freelancing career.</p><h2></h2><p>A contract provides guarantees for both the freelancer and the client. Those guarantees include the scope of the work performed, the terms of payment, deadlines for delivery, and any additional maintenance or followup. As a freelancer, you want to over-clarify every aspect of the work performed and the work not performed, in order to have a healthy relationship with your client. Any ambiguity can cause tension, as these aspects are more difficult to negotiate later on. When I was a freelancer, I used Bonsai (<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/">hellobonsai.com</a>) to create contracts and send them to clients for signing. Another option is <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer">Stuff &amp; Nonsense's Contract Killer</a>, an open-source contract.</p><p><b>Remember to include in your contracts:</b></p><ol><li>Work you will perform.</li><li>Clarify explicit tasks that are out of scope.</li><li>Terms of payment including deposits, termination fees, delivery of payment, and late payment fees.</li><li>Responsibilities and liabilities for both parties, including if either party changes their mind.</li><li>Ownership, intellectual property, copyright, or other legal concerns. Upon full payment of services.</li></ol><p>A contract is going to make the biggest difference in your relationship with clients, and how effective you are as a freelancer. These stipulations protect both you and the client and guarantee you'll have a good time. If you're unsure about your contract, reach out to lawyers and go for consultations. A lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and information technology can provide better guidance, and many offer free consultations. </p><hr><h2></h2><p>When negotiating a contract with a client, the work performed should be clearly outlined. As part of this process, you will also want to rule out any ambiguity and clarify the work that will <i>not</i> be performed. This is for your protection in the event that later down the line, the client makes a request that is outside of the scope of the contract.</p><p>A previous client of mine brought me on to clean up the front-end design for a project. It was a reasonable project that I could deliver in the short-term, about a month and a half. Two weeks later, I started receiving requests to develop new features. This would have delayed the time to complete the contract and made it impossible for me to begin a contract I had already queued up thereafter. Using the contract as a reference, I denied the request as it was outside of the scope that I was able to perform to deliver in time.</p><hr><h2></h2><p>Freelancers are self-employed which has additional costs than a full-time employee. They pay self-employment taxes which is about 15.3%. Moreover, freelancers must pay for their own health insurance. The market rate for a freelance job should be at least one and a half times (1.5x) what a full-time employee would make. This will cover your additional expenses. </p><p>Your rate will largely depend on what you're able to negotiate. Freelance jobs depend on supply and demand, and what value you're able to bring to a job. A client is paying you for more than your time: they're paying for your experience too. So while it may take 8 hours to create a webpage, your rate also takes into account the years of experience you have in honing your craft.</p><hr><h2></h2><p>Deposits are protections for both freelancers and clients. They also help cover expenses to smooth out time in between paydays. A contract deposit is an insurance that the client is able to pay you for performing the work. For these reasons, I've learned that a deposit is non-negotiable.</p><p>Clients should want to pay you a deposit because it also demonstrates your commitment to getting the job done. A client that does not want to pay the deposit, will give you trouble later. If they try to negotiate, they will give you trouble later. </p><p><b>In conclusion:</b></p><ol><li>The deposit is non-negotiable.</li><li>The deposit is non-negotiable.</li><li>The deposit is non-negotiable.</li></ol><hr><h2></h2><p>Freelancing carries an additional responsibility to manage the pipeline for contracts. You will want to have another contract lined up before your current contract ends. When it's time to start the next contract, you will want to have already made plans for thereafter.</p><p>Sometimes a contract doesn't work out. There may come a time when a freelancer finds themselves wanting to void or otherwise not renew a contract. In this situation, it's helpful to have a backup plan to bridge the gap. Short term contracts that are easy to pick up and complete are a great way to fulfill periods of time in between contracts.</p><hr><h2></h2><p>Money does not replace happiness. When a job doesn't feel right, trust your gut and instincts. If the terms of a contract are not happening as expected, there are a few options:</p><ul><li>Talk to the client to try and resolve the situation.</li><li>Absolving the contract amicably.</li><li>Seek legal consultation.</li><li>Walk away.</li></ul><p>It's important to understand that above all, communication is important. Talking to the client to resolve the situation requires deep introspection into what is working and what is not working. If there is a shared sense of wanting to absolve the contract amicably, that requires communication. Ideally, there's no need to involve legal representation. The legal route requires balancing the potential loss in the contract stipends versus the loss from time spent in the legal process. When all other options are exhausted, sometimes the best option is to walk away.</p><hr><h2></h2><p>Knowing when to walk away from a contract is important, but knowing when to run from a bad client is even more important. There are some behaviors I've observed in my freelancing career that are definite red flags. </p><h3></h3><p>Assume that any client that does not want to sign a contract does not want to pay you. A contract protects both parties, and without one they want to abuse their position as the party that holds the money.</p><p><b>Run from the client that doesn't want to sign a contract.</b></p><h3></h3><p>If they ask right off the bat "how much will this cost?" Or "does it really cost that much?" If they are asking questions like this, it's a fair assumption that they are looking for the cheapest supply they can demand. Assume that any client that tries to barter your rate or deposit does not want to pay you. </p><p><b>Run from the barter that pretends to be a client.</b></p><h3></h3><p>As a freelancer, you want to work for someone who hires you for the service and value you provide. A good client understands where their abilities end and where your abilities start. When the client is also the designer or a developer, the working relationship is difficult to facilitate because the relationship is unequal and imbalanced. This can be managed, so long as the work performed is not stipulated on work that has yet to be performed. A good contract stands on its own.</p><p><b>Run from the client that really wants an employee.</b></p><h3></h3><p>Your time is money. A good client recognizes this and hires a freelancer with a clear set of scope, requirements, and timelines. If none of these dependencies are clarified within the first few exchanges, then the client is trying to extract as much free labor from you as possible. Any spec work, prototyping, or brainstorming is labor that should be compensated.</p><p><b>Run from clients that try to diminish your value before they hire you. </b></p><h3></h3><p>It is not your job to provide a client with direction. A good contract stipulates that you perform a finite list of tasks based on what the client wants. </p><p><b>Run from the client that wants a freelancer to also be a CEO. </b></p><h3></h3><p>Timelines and deliverables should be settled before the contract is signed, and is mostly at the discretion of the freelancer. The client can share their expectations when they need the served to be completed, however, ASAP is not a timeline. ASAP means they will micro-manage you and treat you like a commodity. This client will not respect your boundaries.</p><p><b>Run from the client that won't respect your boundaries.</b></p><h3></h3><p>You get an email about an exciting, innovative project, and they want your help to get it off the ground. They want you to sign an NDA before they communicate the scope, requirements, or budget. This client is asking you to perform a service before the contract is signed.</p><p>If you receive a request like this, kindly reply with this response:</p><blockquote>Thank you for your interest. I'm happy to schedule a consultation with you to engage in a more thorough conversation. I require a $1000 signing fee, $500/hr rate, and 3 hour minimum for any sensitive consultations.</blockquote><p>If they're serious about the idea and understand your value, they will pay you for this consultation. Otherwise, any client that is afraid you will steal their idea is likely going to be a waste of time. They will shop the idea around cautiously until some other eager entrepreneur beats them to market. </p><p><b>Run from the client who hesitates before hiring you.</b></p><h3></h3><p>The promise of future work is not a currency. This is a sneaky way of bartering compensation by promising stability. Assume that anything not stipulated in the contract is not going to …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>It’s Monday. The first of the seven alarms you’ve set on your phone soars louder than the Big Ben. It sends chills down your spine announcing the impending doom: your 8 AM commute. You put on that white shirt you’re sick of, and head to the most crowded place on earth: the <a href="https://www.cityam.com/londons-most-crowded-tube-lines-revealed/">northern line</a>.</p>

<p>Your commute is a problem, and you want to solve it. <strong>The challenge with <em>solving</em> problems is that it’s usually harder to find a solution than it is <em>not</em> to have that particular issue in the first place</strong>.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I buy that used Toyota Prius for half the price?”. “It’s time to start cycling; perhaps it will get me in shape too”. “Does Tim Ferris <em>really</em> wake up at five? I bet no one takes the tube at that time”.</p>

<p>Buying a car, commuting by bike, or waking up earlier are all <em>solutions</em> to the problem of having an uncomfortable commute. Nevertheless, they’re imperfect because they are <em>patches</em>.</p>

<p>If you buy a car, you’ll still get stuck in traffic. If you buy a bike, you’ll get sweaty, and you’ll have to change clothes when you get to work. Personally, I love waking up at five, and at that time there’s definitely no one in the tube, but it doesn’t matter how early I get out of bed, I still have to face a thirty-minute commute.</p>

<p><strong>It’s rare, if not impossible, to apply patches which completely resolve the problems you have. More often than not, applying patches creates new problems.</strong></p>

<p>When faced with a problem, instead of immediately trying to patch it, I’d recommend you to take a step back and think about whether you could avoid it altogether.</p>

<p>Just because you <em>hate</em> commuting, it doesn’t mean you should look for ways to make it more pleasant. The most efficient way to solve the commute problem is <em>not</em> to commute at all.</p>

<p>If you work from home, you won’t need to spend any money in a car, put any effort in cycling, or ruin your circadian rhythm by waking up too early.</p>

<p>Now think about managing a website which depends on a particular RESTful API, for example. Every time you make changes to the underlying API, you’ll have to update your client. These updates are time-consuming, and they need to happen immediately. Otherwise, you won’t be able to deploy either your back-end or front-end.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of trying to patch the problem by finding more complicate and suboptimal solutions, like, for example, synchronising deployments, you could avoid the problem altogether by <em>not</em> making breaking changes to your API’s routes.</p>

<p>If you version your API by prefixing each of its routes, you won’t break the client. Therefore, you won’t have to synchronise deployments or immediately schedule work to update your front-end as soon as you start changing the server.</p>

<p>Instead of <em>patching</em> the problem, you eliminated it.</p>

<p>Yet, you can’t <em>always</em> completely eliminate all obstacles. There is a third kind of solution, which is a mix of the previous two. Even though it involves a patch, its patch entirely eliminates the problem.</p>

<p>You can’t, for example, solve every software problem by <em>not</em> creating any software. Even though software creates issues, it makes our lives significantly better most of the time.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to eliminate software altogether, you should find ways to write <em>less</em> software.</p>

<p>UNIX streams are an excellent example of this kind of solution. Because streams allow programs to communicate with each other, they enable you to combine existing programs instead of creating new ones.</p>

<p>Even though we’ve had to create software for streams to work, we didn’t have to write <em>too much</em> of it. We’ve written a little bit of code so that we could write less of it in the future.</p>

<p>These kinds of solutions are interesting because they’re usually winners in the market.</p>

<p>When we had problems managing our own data-centres, for example, the winner products weren’t the ones which made it more efficient to manage your own hardware. The winners were those who allowed you not to have a data-centre altogether. That was the birth of VPS’s.</p>

<p>Now, we’re seeing the exact same process happening on the cloud computing space because running program’s in someone else’s hardware creates yet another problem.</p>

<p>Even though companies don’t have to maintain their own data-centres anymore, they still have to manage the machines in which they host their software.</p>

<p>Again, we’re faced with the choice to patch the problem or find a solution which eliminates it altogether.</p>

<p>We can create complex programs to <a href="https://github.com/chef/chef">provision servers</a>, <a href="https://www.nagios.org/">monitor their resources</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">orchestrate our system’s components</a>, or we can avoid using these “virtual machines” altogether by using Lambdas, for example.</p>

<p>I bet that cloud-native architectures will win.</p>

<p>In the same way that we chose not to maintain data-centers instead of making it easier to manage them, we’ll decide not to manage any servers instead of making it more efficient to do so.</p>



<hr>





<p>I do <em>not</em> necessarily think that cloud-native architectures are objectively better.</p>

<p>These services have dozens of disadvantages about which I could write entire posts. The most significant of them is probably vendor lock-in.</p>

<p>What I’m saying instead is that I believe the majority of the market will end up adopting these kinds of services.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Over the years I've used every operating system. Sometimes all at once. Recently I've taken to using Linux as my primary desktop operating system. Everything I need runs natively on Linux and because I have full control over my environment I never have down time due to forced updates. This is my desktop after all so I'm really switching from Windows where the Control key modifier paradigm is more or less the same as Linux. Still I didn't want to compromise on anything with this new configuration and there was one thing missing from my Macbook that I really wanted.</p>
<p>Of course what I'm talking about is the Command key or more colloquially known simply as the Apple Key and all the shortcuts and hot keys built into macOS that make it such a joy to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/70" width="200"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Linux lets you change whatever you want."</em></p>
<p>Is a common thing that people say to bring up a positive aspect of GNU/Linux. Is this actually true though? Take for example my issue at hand: Changing copy/paste hotkeys for all programs. In truth, some tasks are so big in their scope few users would ever be capable of accomplishing them. At least not without a lot of contextual knowledge.</p>
<p>Getting macOS style hotkeys is actually an extremely difficult task in Linux. Especially when you want to avoid faking it by binding some keys to other keys on a per application basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's the question of why do it at all?</p>
<p><span><span>The truth is I just got tired of </span></span><span><span>accidentally sending SIGINTs when switching to terminal and then accidentally triggering the wrong thing when switching out of terminal. I've just gotten so used to not having to context switch my brain in macOS between programs. It's one of the things that truly makes my Macbook Pro more pleasant to use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://technex.us/media/73"></span></span></p>
<p>So that's my first reason. Muscle memory.</p>
<p>My second reason is simply that Command/Meta is directly next to the space bar and I just like having a shorter stretching span for my hand.</p>

<h3>Making it work</h3>
<p>For the most part GUI applications written for Linux tend to make a lot of assumptions about what hotkeys can and should be in a very opinionated way. Some types of programs require full customization (like code editors) while others like browsers tend to force certain hotkeys. Desktop managers do provide their own hotkey bindings. For example most KDE based applications will use your settings from KDE's "System Settings" to set hotkeys. Meanwhile in Gnome you can use dbind to set your keybinds.</p>
<p>Of course Cut/Copy/Paste is not enough. It would actually be quite jarring to use CTRL+T for opening a new tab immediately after using Command+V to paste something. Indeed if you go down this path you'll end up having to redefine your hotkeys for well..... everything. It is unfortunate as well that applications these days are extremely hostile to user settings.</p>
<p>Despite the hurdles in front of me I decided to try to make it work.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was swap Left Alt and Left Meta on my keyboard. This was actually pretty easy to do with keyboard mapping configs with the KDE GUI simply known as "System Settings". This was simply to make my normal windows keyboard place the buttons in the positions a real mac keyboard would have. None of this is necessary if you have a real Apple layout keyboard. This setting is only active while in my X session so any alternative TTYs would revert back to my stock layout. If I had a real Apple layout keyboard though this is not necessary at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/71"></p>
<p>This setting is saved to the text file <code>~/.config/kxkbrc.</code></p>
<pre><code>$ cat kxkbrc 
[Layout]
DisplayNames=
LayoutList=us
LayoutLoopCount=-1
Model=pc101
Options=altwin:swap_lalt_lwin
ResetOldOptions=true
ShowFlag=false
ShowLabel=true
ShowLayoutIndicator=true
ShowSingle=false
SwitchMode=Global
Use=true
</code></pre>
<p>Now with this setting I am able to fake the same key mapping as a real macOS&nbsp;keyboard would have in my desktop session. So far so good. Now I manually changed all my hotkeys in my code editors, terminal applications, and even in the System Settings app I just mentioned to set global hot keys for all KDE applications. This took some time but was very straight forward for the most part.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/72"></p>
<p>I went above and beyond even changing my shortcuts for things like Select All.</p>
<p>While this worked for KDE applications I had to also make this change for GTK+ based programs as well. Luckily this would also cover Chrome, Discord, Elements, and a number of other Electron based programs that I use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I was lucky that VSCode let me change everything but it was very annoying have to redo all the system based hotkeys like Set cursor to start of the line (in macOS this is Meta+Left Arrow) for each and every place I wanted to use it.</p>
<p>Some websites also use Meta+C for example in Github hitting Meta+C will actually take focus and bring you to the Add Comment UI when in a thread so sometimes on Github.com even with Firefox set to use Meta+C to copy something I am not actually able to use my hotkey because the website overrides it.</p>
<p>With GTK I ended up editing <code>`</code><span><code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`</code> </span><span>and setting these hotkeys.</span></p>
<pre><code>@binding-set gtk-super-cut-copy-paste
{
        bind "&lt;super&gt;x" { "cut-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;c" { "copy-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;v" { "paste-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;a" { "select-all" (1) };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;z" { "undo" () };
}

* {
        -gtk-key-bindings: gtk-super-cut-copy-paste
}
</code></pre>
<p>I might add more but for now this got me to where I wanted with most GTK+ applications. Note that if you plan to run any of programs designed to run as root that use GTK+ such as GParted you should also link or copy this config file to the root account home directory as well.</p>
<p>So in the end it is possible. I was able to achieve what I wanted with all but one program. But it was a huge pain. It's really difficult to figure out what settings do what in a Linux environment even when there is documentation. It's typical for documentation to exist for say GTK+ 2.0 and GTK+ 3.0 but there is no over arching best practice guide for what one should do when they want to cover all programs in an environment.</p>


<h3>It Doesn't Have to Be This Way</h3>
<p>The Linux ecosystem can and should do better. The ability to do whatever you want is a double edged sword where even though you can in theory change things, in practice however, sometimes changing things is so onerous that staying sane in the process is a task in itself.</p>
<p>So please if you are a Linux user space developer check the GTK+ 2.0 (<code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code>), GTK+ 3.0 (<code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css</code>) and KDE global shortcut configs (<code>~/.config/kdeglobals</code>) when you probe for the environment during startup so that people can choose their own hotkeys for their desktop environment or simply use the C libraries of each and use the hotkeys present.</p>
<p>Better yet, if you are a developer that already supports various input methods for macOS, Linux, and Windows you can simply provide a toggle for users.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to Linux Desktop environments to agree to a standard config file for hotkeys allowing users to bind keys as they see fit rather than lurching from one weird keybinding config to the next with no centralization to speak off.</p>

<![CDATA[Ergonomic Haskell 1 – Records]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <section>
        
<p>We have heard of Boring Haskell, Simple Haskell, and Fancy Haskell… but let’s ignore all of those and focus more on us. Why not make Haskell <em>feel</em> nicer to use? To do that we’ll focus on its UX and ergonomics and hopefully end up with…</p>
<p>Ergonomic Haskell!</p>
<p>If it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice to use</li>
<li>Not horribly complex</li>
<li>Doesn’t give horrible type errors</li>
</ul>
<p>So even if something costs us a little bit of extra complexity, the logic goes that the annoyance it gets rid of will be worth it most of the time. Extra points if it could let us tap into yet to be understood benefits.</p>
<p>There is a bias towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>ergonomics of reading over ergonomics of writing</li>
<li>easy to read long term vs easy to understand in the very short term</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Everything about this series will be highly opinionated and subjective, based on things that I’ve noticed “feel good” and make code easier to understand over time.</p>
<p>The format will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple</li>
<li>short</li>
<li>avoid unnecessary detail or justification of choices</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the ergonomics and end result are at the forefront :)</p>

<h2 id="the-default-ergonomics-are-bad">The default ergonomics are bad</h2>
<p>This style is currently dominant with the simple but annoying work-around of prefixing the field name. Perhaps its harsh to call this bad ergonomics, but my brain really doesn’t take well to all the duplication and I’d hazard a guess this holds true for others as well.</p>
<p>Its usage is even noisier and less ergonomic in surprisingly consequential ways once your real-world code uses enough record fields. My theory is the duplication in label names puts a wrench in some peoples thinking process just like it does mine.</p>
<p>These are the data types for the default “bad ergonomics” example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span> {<span> name ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> age ::</span> <span>Int</span>}</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>data</span> <span>Dog</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dog</span> {<span>name ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> age ::</span> <span>Int</span>}</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>data</span> <span>CatBall</span> <span>=</span> <span>CatBall</span> {<span> name ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> type_ ::</span> <span>String</span>}</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>data</span> <span>Cat</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cat</span> {<span> name ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> age ::</span> <span>Int</span>,<span> favoriteBall ::</span> <span>CatBall</span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here is what the implementation of that default looks like:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>if</span> personName person <span>==</span> <span>"codygman"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">        <span>then</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">          <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Good day, "</span> <span>++</span> personName person</span>
<span id="cb2-4">          <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your dog's name: "</span> <span>++</span> dogName dog</span>
<span id="cb2-5">          <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your cat's name: "</span> <span>++</span> catName cat</span>
<span id="cb2-6">          <span>if</span> (catBallName <span>.</span> favoriteBall <span>$</span> cat) <span>==</span> <span>"doggos"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7">            <span>then</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8">              <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"One second.. there's been a mix up it seems!"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">              <span>let</span> fixedCat <span>=</span> cat { favoriteBall <span>=</span> (favoriteBall cat) </span>
<span id="cb2-10">                                     { catBallName <span>=</span> <span>"cattos"</span>, catBallType <span>=</span> <span>"yarn ball"</span> } </span>
<span id="cb2-11">                                 }</span>
<span id="cb2-12">              <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your cat's favorite ball type: "</span> <span>++</span> (catBallType <span>.</span> favoriteBall <span>$</span> fixedCat)</span>
<span id="cb2-13">            <span>else</span> <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your cat's name: "</span> <span>++</span> catName cat</span>
<span id="cb2-14">        <span>else</span> <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"THIS IS MY PROGRAM! I DON'T KNOW YOU! *KICK*"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In Ergonomic Haskell we don’t have room for all of this noise, but we do have room for one-time upfront costs that will make our lives a little nicer through the life of the project.</p>
<p>We instead demand the most ergonomic solution today! That looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>if</span> person <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>name <span>==</span> <span>"codygman"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>then</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Good day, "</span> <span>++</span> person <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>name</span>
<span id="cb3-4">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your dog's name: "</span> <span>++</span> dog <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>name</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your cat's name: "</span> <span>++</span> cat <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>name</span>
<span id="cb3-6">    <span>if</span> <span>#</span>cat <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>favoriteBall <span>%</span> <span>#</span>name <span>==</span> <span>"doggos"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7">      <span>then</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8">        <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"One second.. there's been a mix up it seems!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9">        <span>let</span> fixedCat <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb3-10">              cat <span>&amp;</span> <span>#</span>favoriteBall <span>%</span> <span>#</span>name <span>.~</span> <span>"cattos"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-11">                  <span>&amp;</span> <span>#</span>favoriteBall <span>%</span> <span>#</span>ballType <span>.~</span> <span>"yarn ball"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-12">        <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your cat's favorite ball type: "</span> <span>++</span> fixedCat <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>name</span>
<span id="cb3-13">      <span>else</span> <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Your cat's name: "</span> <span>++</span> cat <span>^.</span> <span>#</span>name</span>
<span id="cb3-14">  <span>else</span> <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"THIS IS MY PROGRAM! I DON'T KNOW YOU! *KICK*"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="learned-simplicity">Learned Simplicity</h2>
<p>You might disagree with me on the above being simpler. At first I thought the same and asked:</p>
<p>How can symbols be simpler than words?</p>
<p>Answer: When they don’t matter.</p>
<p>What if you in oop languages for <code>foo.bar</code> you instead had to do <code>foo dot bar</code> each time? Wouldn’t that be distracting? By using something that takes up less space, you can concentrate on the piece that matters.</p>
<p>Less is more.</p>
<p>Recall that earlier I said one of the goals of Ergonomic Haskell was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>easy to read long term vs easy to understand in the very short term</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My argument is that while this isn’t as simple as I’d like it to be, this is the most ergonomic and simple solution in Modern Haskell right now after a small adjustment period.</p>
<p>It’s simpler to just prefix field names with the data type name in the same way it’s simpler to not have Generics in a modern programming language: It’s not.</p>
<p>We have so many things to focus on that we must preserve our ability to communicate what pieces of our code are most important. In this case, it takes the form of us learning a few symbols in exchange for much less noisy code which more clearly communicates it’s intent over the long term.</p>
<h2 id="uncovering-the-simplicity">Uncovering the simplicity</h2>
<p>In other languages you might simply write <code>dog.name</code> and <code>cat.name</code> respectively. All Haskeller’s admit this is the simplest outcome and work is being done to make that possible in Haskell too (see the next section). No arguments here!</p>
<p>Here’s a table that should help make sense of the code above:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Language</th>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Operator</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Java</td>
<td>get</td>
<td>person.age</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Haskell</td>
<td>get</td>
<td>person ^. age</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Java</td>
<td>set</td>
<td>person.age = 25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Haskell</td>
<td>set</td>
<td>person &amp; age .~ 25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Java</td>
<td>chained set</td>
<td>person.age = 25; person.name = “Bob”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Haskell</td>
<td>chained set</td>
<td>person &amp; age .~ 25 &amp; name .~ “Bob”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After a few coding sessions with these operators or playing around in the REPL, you might not even need this chart anymore.</p>
<p>I’d written a longer explanation of these things, but I think that’s where a lot of tutorials fall down. Our brains are very good at matching patterns and discerning meanings, so we should merely present differences in a simple format and let our readers brains go to work!</p>
<p>A potential bonus is that the underneath what we are using as getters/setters are fully powered optics. The value of that is hard to communicate, and it’s the “feeling” of using them that’s more valuable anyway. At the very end of this post I’ll share one tiny snippet to try and push that feeling from my brain to yours.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-hopeful">The future is hopeful</h2>
<p>In the future per <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst">RecordDotSyntax</a> the dot syntax you know from other languages will be possible and look like:</p>

	<div>
		<p>There are many moving parts involved when it comes to creating and <a href="https://torquemag.io/2019/10/woocommerce-maintenance-how-to-care-for-your-e-commerce-site/">maintaining a WooCommerce site</a>. Product pages are a key element that is easy to overlook, but vital to the success of your online business.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few techniques you can implement to significantly improve your product pages. Since theyâ€™re a primary driving force behind most customersâ€™ purchasing decisions, itâ€™s wise to do all you can to enhance their effectiveness.</p>
<p>In this post, weâ€™ll discuss why product pages are so important to the success of your WooCommerce site. Then weâ€™ll share four strategies you can use to improve yours. Letâ€™s get right to it!</p>

<p>Whether youâ€™re new to e-commerce, or have been selling products online for a while and want to increase sales, youâ€™ve probably come across plenty of advice for optimizing your WooCommerce site. However, most of it is likely general guidance for improving performance or <a href="https://torquemag.io/2018/05/how-to-use-blogging-to-drive-more-traffic-to-your-site/">driving traffic</a> your way.</p>
<p>While those tips can be highly effective, loading pages quickly and getting visitors to your site wonâ€™t necessarily bring the conversion rate you want if your product pages are still lacking. At the end of the day, that is where sales actually take place.</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://letstalkaboutmoney.com/ecommerce-statistics/">85 percent of customers conduct research</a> online before deciding which brand to purchase a product from. This means that itâ€™s highly important to publish detailed and clear information about your merchandise on your website, so shoppers can learn everything they want to know about each item.</p>
<p>Product pages are a prime source of information about the different products customers may want to buy. However, in order for them to become quality resources, youâ€™ll need to provide the details that are important to shoppers and will help seal the deal.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to make your WooCommerce product pages more effective. The strategies that work best for you will depend on what you sell and your existing WordPress workflow. However, these four tips are a solid starting point to jump off from.</p>
<h2>1. Incorporate High-Quality Images</h2>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of buying products online is that itâ€™s more difficult to get a sense of what the items are like in person. You can help minimize your customersâ€™ indecision by providing high-quality images of your merchandise:</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nKZ0UUZXH9Rhw4g_kudtV984hdzyuYVD1qC30p6NWJKCsIIANl5dOZQHsjml5NDsD1xBLIWoW4Zq2WfrWrCccMqFKRTdkSAFeQ7InqtZwI28FfOAj0YE0UvQb_HQzLuMRzDtQe7i" alt=""></figure>
<p>The best product images include the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper lighting, so products appear clear and easy to see</li>
<li>Plain backgrounds that arenâ€™t distracting</li>
<li>Multiple angles, so customers can recreate the experience of picking up an item and looking at it</li>
<li>Closeups and/or a zoom feature that enables shoppers to see details such as stitching</li>
</ul>
<p>While you can certainly achieve all of these goals on your own, you might also consider <a href="https://clippingpathindia.com/blogs/tips/how-hire-product-photographer-commercial-freelance">hiring a professional product photographer</a> to achieve top quality.</p>
<h2>2. Optimize Product Descriptions With Keywords</h2>
<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is not only important for driving organic traffic to your site, but also for helping customers find what theyâ€™re looking for. <a href="https://torquemag.io/2016/10/wordpress-seo-find-the-right-keywords-for-your-site/">Using keywords</a> in your product descriptions can speed up their searches and filter out irrelevant results.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://unamo.com/blog/seo/comprehensive-guide-writing-seo-friendly-product-description">writing descriptions for your product pages</a>, make sure to use common terms that users might be searching for when looking for specific types of items. Highlight key features, and use clear and direct language so shoppers can understand the benefits of buying your products.</p>
<p>With that being said, you donâ€™t want your product descriptions to become lists of search terms. Keep in mind that their primary purpose is to provide value to customers, and help them make purchasing decisions. That means itâ€™s important to work your keywords in naturally.</p>
<p>To help with this, you might consider investing in <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/yoast-woocommerce-seo/">Yoast SEO for WooCommerce</a> or a similar plugin. Such tools can provide suggestions for improving your descriptions right in the product page editor.</p>
<h2>3. Include Conversion-Boosting Elements</h2>
<p>Product pages are often the first step in the checkout process. <a href="https://mercury.one/online-business/6-website-friction-points-that-plummet-conversion-rates/">Minimizing friction</a> throughout the buyerâ€™s journey can help improve your sales rate and decrease shopping cart abandonment.</p>
<p>Incorporating one-click purchase buttons, variation and quantity selectors, and other elements that streamline your product pagesâ€™ UX can go a long way towards boosting your profits:</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3Z1Ksr-uo9OthkOERJmF9kHRdoEXbeCyKUfooySvRQvxfAn7ooDxhIzIGO40fV_COiWuVUFfsSz64Fby4LaR050SrLvEzy6Yt2SMZOXEc12Y8uGLlxXOnhX2rpE1RUxj7W4icyd6" alt=""></figure>
<p>A simple way to add these features is by choosing a quality WooCommerce theme that includes them out of the box.</p>
<p>If you already have a theme that you like, however, there are plenty of other ways to enhance your product pages. For example, the Block Editor includes a button block that you can customize to suit your goals. There are also several <a href="https://torquemag.io/2019/12/best-gutenberg-plugins/">Block Editor extensions</a> you can use to access elements such as â€˜heroâ€™ content, unique photo gallery layouts, and more.</p>
<h2>4. Use a WordPress Page Builder</h2>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://torquemag.io/2019/06/are-page-builders-relevant/">page builders</a> are very useful for enhancing your product pages. For starters, many of them include WooCommerce-specific elements that you can easily drag-and-drop into your content, including user ratings, upsells, and more:</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Vk4fk6F-GLMiSXSAf4BXHQdaVLfsiOhOlWlAT9H2ArQOyqWZobUgDH2HY6kRdb1aOo3XMVoeEIMnZElduT7Tr367a9QMHM80Mt1afsAzE4IbZJIrTk0cWwu8hyWHfVM5RABI-Keg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Beyond adding advanced elements, page builders also enable you to see your content from a customerâ€™s perspective while youâ€™re creating it. This can help you catch potential problems that might derail buyers and steer them away from your site.</p>
<p>With a page builder, you can also use templates to speed up the design process and maintain consistency between product listings. There are many excellent WordPress page builders you can use to <a href="https://woostify.com/elementor-product-page/">customize WooCommerce product pages</a>, and most are extremely easy to get started with.</p>

<p>There are many site optimization best practices that can help you improve your online storeâ€™s performance and overall UX. However, itâ€™s also important not to overlook your product pages, as they play a key role in encouraging customers to complete purchases.</p>
<p>In this post, weâ€™ve covered a few key ways you can improve your WooCommerce product pages to make them more enticing to customers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorporate high-quality photos.</li>
<li>Optimize product descriptions with keywords.</li>
<li>Include conversion-boosting elements such as buttons and timers.</li>
<li>Use a WordPress page builder.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Preface: There is very little in this blog post that is interesting from a technical perspective. The discovered vulnerability is incredibly basic but fairly high risk. Due to the nature of the application, and the fallout from our disclosure attempt, we wanted to write up our findings. The TL;DR is that giggle has been exposing user’s phone numbers, private images and location to the world.</p>

<p>Normally we wouldn’t post a vulnerability like this so soon after discovering it but the owner of the app refuses to listen to us and continuously claims no vulnerability exists. We tried to get in contact with her via a third party (after we had been blocked) to let her read this post before publishing it but, again, she showed no interest.</p>

<p>(edit: We wrote but didn’t publish this article before the vulnerability was fixed. Giggle has told us it has now been fixed so we feel comfortable releasing these details.)</p>

<p>(edit2: Sall is threating us with legal action.)</p>

<p>(edit3: We’ve had some questions about the phrasing in the first public tweet. We standby our words. Not knowing how this would play out, we wanted to make it clear that we didn’t support the app or the founder, but wanted to report the issue. Companies can be unpredictable when reporting vulnerabilities and we wanted to avoid a situation where they would be publicly praising us or even mentioning us on their website etc.)</p>

<p>(edit4: An apology from Giggle has been made and no futher legal action will be taken)</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="what-is-giggle">What is Giggle?</h3>

<p>This week I set up an account on an app called giggle. You see, last month I had been diagnosed with premature menopause I and wanted to find a safe space in a woman centric environment. Somewhere I could talk openly about this experience and maybe get some support, but also find some light hearted way to socialise online.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image1.jpeg.resize.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Without much investigation I found giggle, which seemed to check all the boxes. A free app, promoting safe and secure social networking. Giggle promised a refuge from misogyny and sexism where I could find support and community.</p>

<p>There were a few red flags, such as an excessive use of pink and word “females”, but I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>At this point the red flags became a little more crimson. Firstly, I was asked to submit my phone number so that a verification code could be sent to my mobile. Then I was asked to allow the app to access my camera so that a selfie of me could be submitted to verify I was female. This verification, apparently, is done using AI. From previous work done on this, we know this can often be notorious for mischaracterising and therefore excluding certain racial groups, some trans women and some masculine looking women.</p>

<p>The app assured me that my verification picture would not be stored so not to worry about what I looked like, so my gargoylesq visage was submitted (I’ll get to the later) and I was duly approved to enter the app.</p>

<p>I went to set up my profile to see what information was publicly available about me, even if only in the app, to find there wasn’t one and I had to set up multiple profiles or ‘giggles’ to start a tinder like experience on each specific subject I was interested in (I chose menopause, body image, hiking and wine tasting), that range from socialising and hobbies to more high risk areas such as abuse and sex work.</p>

<p>As I was curious how secure my data was, and as we are currently working on improvements to <a href="https://rex.digitalinterruption.com/">REX</a> (and thought they’d maybe like a <a href="https://www.digitalinterruption.com/100-free-rex-licences">free license</a>), we decided to dig a little deeper.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-account-details">Viewing Account Details</h3>

<p>Using BurpSuite and a fresh install of the app, we intercepted the network traffic and found a few interesting things that we decided not to look at further as we didn’t have permission to do a full analysis. During the registration process, as mentioned, users are required to verify a phone number and selfie. We submitted a selfie that wouldn’t pass and, unsurprisingly, couldn’t gain access to giggle.</p>

<p>Looking at the network requests revealed that although the account was in an unvalidated state, we still had a valid auth token (it turns out this is hardcoded into the application) allowing us to make requests to the API. Again, we didn’t perform a full analysis although we suspect issues could exist here. What we did look at was the UserList endpoint. This contained a filter parameter that contained my phone number, an operator (in this case “equals”) and a field (“mobile”). Presumably, this is how a user’s account details are fetched from the API.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image2.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, the obvious question is what would happen if we changed this filter parameter to be another phone number, changed the query to filter on another parameter such as user ID or user’s name or even would it remove the filter altogether, allowing us to view all accounts?</p>

<p>First, we decided to change the filter query so it would filter based on the GUID of the original account which we received during our initial analysis. This brought back the original account details which included the user’s phone number, age (which was set to hidden) and a latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>Request:</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image3.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Response:</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image4.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Having the phone number is bad enough, but we checked the returned latitude and longitude using Google Maps. Of course, this brought us to the very house I created the account in.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image5.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This means an attacker that is completely unverified to the application can view the address and phone number of all users if they have the account ID. That is pretty bad in our opinion.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to be able to download the same details without knowing the account ID. Looking at the filter parameter, it’s clear to see there would be many ways to do this. We could remove the filter completely although that would reveal other accounts to us which we were trying to avoid seeing or we could change the query to show all accounts not matching a phone number. As a proof of concept, we decided to change the operator field from “equals” to “contains” and truncated the GUID. As this returned the same data, it should be obvious to see how the query could be trivially modified to expose all registered accounts with no prerequisite account knowledge.</p>

<p>Request:</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image6.png.resize.png" alt="Burp Web Request"></p>

<h3 id="selfies">Selfies!</h3>

<p>What about the supposed private picture that is used to verify accounts? They claim not to store? Behold my gargoylesq visage!</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image7.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we look at the URL of the verification image (which we recovered by viewing network traffic in BurpSuite), we can see that the only thing that is required is the user GUID. As we can view the user GUID for every account (e.g. our test account) we can easily download the associated verification selfie. Although this is not terrible on it’s own, giggle do promise that this isn’t shared or published, and, given that it is available data stored along side my mobile number and geographical coordinates, with this information an attacker would know my address, my personal mobile number and what I look like.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image8.jpeg.resize.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is where we get to the really scary bit. Giggle has sections encouraging women to find support on abortion, abuse, addiction and relationships among other categories. The amount of available data means that with a phone number or name, an abusive partner would potentially be able to find the location of an abused woman and confirm her identity with the verification picture. There is also a section for sex workers, who, understandably would expect any app enabling them to advertise their work to have adequate privacy and security controls. Even if a user deletes their account, that data appears to still be saved by giggle.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image13.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="account-deletion">Account Deletion</h3>

<p>The final thing we looked at is whether a deleted account is actually deleted. We deleted the original account using the “Delete Account” button and tried to view the associated account details.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image9.jpeg.resize.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image10.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, they are still present and only set to Disabled meaning they are still stored by the system. Maybe accounts are deleted periodically. We would normally at this point reach out to the vendor and ask for clarification. This leads us to the next part of the story…</p>

<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3>

<p>We wanted to let giggle know that this vuln existed and ask for some further details, not in the small part because it is so easy to exploit. In the midst of this we had done some digging on the origins of the app and found that the founder had a very public anti-trans agenda. However, much as this sickens us, our job is to protect users so we direct messaged giggle through twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image11.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Having had no response, we decided to send them a tweet asking them to check their DMs with their founder cc’d in, but with a caveat that we do not share or endorse her anti-trans views.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image12.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That’s when we were dragged into a full on TERF War.</p>

<p>Our public tweet had no engagement at all until Sall, the giggle founder, decided to share a screenshot of it with her followers. We have since been subject to a tirade of abuse. None of it about the security of the app. Interested parties are free to view our twitter and find the hundreds and hundreds of tweets in response to trying to disclose this vulnerability but we decided not to copy that into this post.</p>

<p>Our founders have reached out to giggle and Sall and have been blocked following every attempt at contact. Our three year incorporated company has been accused of being a creepy bloke who runs private WhatsApp groups full of naked women, a front for the alt-left, making up the vuln to discredit Sall and her company and hypocrites for wanting to protect the data of users despite the apps founder having view that counter our own.</p>

<p>Our company and I (a woman) have been accused of being a man, and therefore a misogynist multiple times. We have been told that as men (60% of Digital Interruption are women), we should not have a say on the safety of women and their personal data.</p>

<p>Sadly, denial is not uncommon when trying to disclose. We are used to being ignored and even getting some pushback, but ultimately we feel it is our responsibility to persist and ensure the …</p></section></div>

      <p>This week the SF Bay Area is suffering from yet another massive wildfire filling our air with smoke, causing unhealthy air conditions.  The Camp Fire sprang up on November 8, 2018, and destroyed Paradise California, a town in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  While there is a serious tragedy happening in the zone directly affected by the fire, a large chunk of California now has unhealthy air.  Further, officials are predicting unhealthy air conditions will remain in place for another week.  "Unhealthy" is the designation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for air conditions we currently have.  The situation does not warrant spending hundreds of dollars on a fancy air filter system that will be used only for a few days.  Fortunately there is a lower cost easy-to-implement solution.</p>

<p>This solution came thanks to a friend who suggested, via Facebook, that a 20x20 inch box fan plus an AC Filter would work to clean the air.</p>
<p>Just how bad is the air at the moment?</p>
<figure>
        
        <img src="https://techsparx.com/blog/2018/11/img/air-quality-monitoring.jpg">
        
        
</figure>

<p>As I <a href="https://techsparx.com/blog/2018/11/air-quality-monitoring.html">noted in an earlier posting today</a>, I have a portable air quality monitor widget.  This shows just how bad the air is, and today the readings are the worst I've seen since this fire situation began.  Most of the year the reading for PM2.5 is in the teens, but today it is squarely in the region of unhealthy air.  And, the local air quality officials predict air quality over the next few days will keep worsening.  As I write this the Camp Fire is only 30-40% contained, FWIW.</p>
<p>That means over the next few days health dictates taking some kind of action.  I considered driving south and staying in a hotel room, but for how long?  And, I cannot afford to take such a trip.  Staying indoors means having air that is less unhealthy than the outside air, but who wants to stay cooped up all the time?</p>
<p>There are filter units meant to clean the air, and are vital for those with sensitivity to dust or mold or other environmental contaminants.  I haven't looked at the price of such filter units, but am expecting them to cost hundreds of dollars and that I only need the thing for a few days.</p>
<p>When going out of the house, a face mask is recommended.  I happen to have some face masks around, and do not have any recommendations of the best face mask to handle extreme air pollution like this.</p>
<p>At home a less expensive easy to implement air filter system is exactly what my friend recommended -- a fan, with an AC Filter strapped to the front.</p>
<p>After a trip to Home Depot, I came up with the implementation pictured above.  I don't have a 20x20 box fan, so I got a smaller filter that fits on the fan that I do have.  Namely a 14x20 filter, as you can see in the picture.  Using a few bungee cords to hold it in place, and you've got a nice simple solution.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of AC Filters with different levels of filtration.</p>
<figure>
        
        <img src="https://techsparx.com/blog/2018/11/img/fr_4055.jpg">
        
        
</figure>

<p>What I got is a Filter where the labeling claimed the highest level of filtration.  Cost - about $20.  I'll leave this running 24/7 until the smoke clears from the fires.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>On September 27, 1991 BBC 1 broadcast a film on Don DeLillo,
titled "Don DeLillo: The Word, The Image, and The Gun"
which was directed by Kim Evans. As of October 2013 the film has been
put up on YouTube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DTePKA1wgc#t=14" target="BLANK">here's the link</a>.</p>

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_title.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>The film is introduced as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don DeLillo writes dangerous fiction.</p>
  <p>He's been called America's leading contemporary novelist,
  and his ten novels come directly out of the flow of recent history.
  The Kennedy assassination, toxic fallout, acts of terrorism;
  these are all part of the running picture of news against which
  his books are set.</p>
  <p>This film was developed in close collaboration with DeLillo.
  He wanted to use the documentary form to explore the relationships
  between gunmen and the novelist, words and images, the power
  of news and the obsession with apocalypse. In doing so he asks,
  what effect can a novelist have on a culture in which terrorists
  seem to have hijacked the world's narrative.</p></blockquote>

<p>We then hear a bit of a broadcaster describing the Kennedys
as they move through Dallas, then a short passage from <i>Libra</i>.
DeLillo begins to speak:</p>

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_delillo_at_window.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isolation, solitude, secret plotting. A novel is a secret
  a writer may keep for years before he lets it out of his room.
  Writers in hiding, writers in prison. Sometimes their secrets
  turn out to be dangerous to the state machine. For most writers
  in the West of course this danger is extremely remote. The cells
  we live in are strictly personal constructions.</p>
  <p>Let's change the room slightly and imagine another kind of
  apartness. The outsider who builds a plot around his desperation.
  A self-watcher, a lonely young man, living in a fiction he hasn't
  bothered to put down on paper. But this doesn't mean he is unorganized,
  he organizes everything. This is how he keeps from disappearing.
  His head is filled with dangerous secrets, and he may finally
  devise a way to come out of his room. He invents a false name,
  orders a gun though the mail, then looks around for someone famous
  he can shoot.</p></blockquote>
  
<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_at_typewriter.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>
  
<p>DeLillo at 5:20: "I think it's true that none of my novels could have been written in the world that
existed before the assassination.
In my fiction there seems to be a sense
of danger everywhere, of something unraveling.
  When Kennedy was shot, something changed for ever in America. Something opened up, a sense
  of randomness, deep ambiguity, we lost the narrative thread."
  
</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_suddenly.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>From <i>Libra</i> at 15:10: The first movie was <i>Suddenly</i>. Frank Sinatra is a combat veteran
who comes to a small town and takes over a house that overlooks the railwroad depot.
He is here to assassinate the President. (p. 369 in pbk)

</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_suddenly_on_oswald.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>From <i>Libra</i>: Lee felt a stillness around him. He had an eerie sense he was being
watched for his reaction. He felt connected to the events on the screen. It was like secret instructions
entering the network of signals and broadcast bands, the whole busy air of transmission. 
Marina was asleep. They were running a message through the night into his skin. 

</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_watching_oswald_11-53.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

DeLillo at 18:22: "Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I think the footage comes close to uncovering some secret about
the nature of film itself. Film carries something, some mindstream, some myth that may be common to us all. It's as though
the experience of film has acquired a kind of independent existence in 
our consciousness, it's that deeply embedded. Have to get it on film."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_men_on_wing.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

DeLillo at 26:40: "With widespread political terrorism we got our narrative back, calculated acts, not random."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_3_planes.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_bill_gray_maoii.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

From <i>Mao II</i> at 28:45: Bill Gray: "Years ago I used to think it was possible for novelists to alter the life of the culture, 
but now bombmakers and gunmen have taken over that territory.  They make raids on human consciousness, what writers 
used to do, before we were all incorporated."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_nypost_catcher.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

DeLillo at 35:12: "Ordering a photograph of a famous recluse must be a little like ordering an execution. Salinger
resembles a man who's fighting for his life."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_football_crowd.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>Tragedy at Hillsborough England (41:25) - 15 April 1989

</p><p>DeLillo at 40:54 : "Today it's news that has begun to influence the way we see the world. It's news that has
become so extraordinarily dominant. I think we've come to depend on news, the darker the better. In a way we need it, 
because it is the tragic narrative of our time." 

</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_watching_oswald_48-11.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<hr>Here's how <i>The Times</i> listed the program
(Sept 27, 1991):

<blockquote>
  <p>Kim Evan's filmed essay about an American novelist who is
  obsessed by violent images and what they can do to the soul of
  a 20th century culture like his, is dazzlingly, nay blindingly,
  assembled. The camera assumes an adversarial role. It is as much
  a weapon as the guns that feature so strongly in DeLillo's writing.
  Therefore, there are two ways of interpreting it when we talk
  of Evan's scenes being shot. More than one viewing of this film
  will be necessary for those viewers who simply can't keep up
  with what DeLillo is thinking, writing and seeing. It takes time
  to digest statments like "Stalking a victim is a way of
  organizing one's loneliness, making a network out of it"
  or "I knew I must extend myself until the molecules parted
  and I was spliced into the image." In his book <i>Mao II</i>,
  a character says "Keep it simple." Was DeLillo paying
  attention at the time?</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anthony Goldbloom is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. In 2011 &amp; 2012, Forbes Magazine named Anthony as one of the 30 under 30 in technology. In 2011, Fast Company featured him as one of the innovative thinkers who are changing the future of business. He joins Lukas to talk about his vision for Kaggle, how Kaggle &amp; the competitions have changed over the years, how competitive data science can prepare you for the real world, whether he likes Python or R better – and which jobs we should be worried about losing to AI in the next few decades.</p><p>Follow Anthony on <a href="https://twitter.com/antgoldbloom">Twitter</a>, and watch his <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_goldbloom_the_jobs_we_ll_lose_to_machines_and_the_ones_we_won_t">2016 Ted Talk</a>.</p><p>Topics Discussed:<br>0:00 Sneak Peek<br>0:20 Introduction<br>0:45 methods used in kaggle competitions vs mainstream academia<br>2:30 Feature engineering<br>3:55 Kaggle Competitions now vs 10 years ago<br>8:35 Data augmentation strategies<br>10:06 Overfitting in Kaggle Competitions<br>12:53 How to not overfit<br>14:11 Kaggle competitions vs the real world<br>18:15 Getting into ML through Kaggle<br>22:03 Kaggle datasets and kernelss<br>25:48 Favorite under appreciated kernel or dataset<br>28:27 Python &amp; R<br>32:03 Frameworks<br>35:15 2016 Ted talk though the lens of 2020<br>37:54 Reinforcement Learning<br>38:43 What’s the topic in ML that people don’t talk about enough?<br>42:02 Where are the biggest bottlenecks in deploying ML software?</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I remember you were talking about deep learning before I'd really heard about it. You were kinda the first person I knew that was really thinking about it, I think it's because you saw that people were winning Kaggle competitions with new methods that were less mainstream at the time. And I'm kind of wondering if on Kaggle, you're seeing people doing things that you don't think are on the academic mainstream or if you're seeing things that point to what you think could be mainstream production in the next few years.</p><p><strong>Anthony: </strong>It's a good question. I mean, to be honest, the most glaring thing that we see on Kaggle that is not fashionable in academia is that we're still seeing gradient boosting machines do very well on a lot of structured data problems. And there's not a lot of research attention on things like gradient boosting machines now. It begs the question like, have we done everything we can there or is it an area where there is still more that can be done but it's just not the trendy thing? It's hard to get papers published and so it's just not getting the attention. To be honest that's the that's the most glaring difference we see between what is doing well on Kaggle and what is fashionable in the academic literature.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, it's really interesting.</p><p><strong>Anthony: </strong>We are seeing some novel uses of things like BERT and WaveNet being used on forecasting problems. We've seen BERT do really well on chemical informatics type or sorry, problems that have to do with gene sequences and things like that. So we're seeing like use cases, perhaps unknown use cases, for some well-established technologies but I think just the lack of academic focused on these gradient machine algorithms is probably the biggest glaring distinction that we see.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>And so in a structured data competition where gradient boost wins, what are the details that the winners do to win those competitions? Is it still feature engineering or is there other stuff?</p><p><strong>Anthony: </strong>Exactly. And it's finding clever features that other people aren't finding. Perhaps that's it. That's the reason or maybe that's where you could have more academic focus like otherwise to there is no doubt in my mind there are things you could do to automate feature engineering to some extent, and maybe there are some things that companies like Data Robot and h2o are doing when they are baking these recipes. So as an example, you see a date or a time stamp, for instance. That is an incredibly rich field that can become like 70 things, right? Let's say you're doing traffic forecasting, a timestamp can be turned into; Is it rush hour? Is it not rush hour? Is it a weekend? Is it not weekend? Is it summer? Is it winter? Therefore, does it change the probability of rain on a given day or adverse with no snow on the road and things like that? There are definitely things that could be done to automate components or help with some of the heavy lifting and feature engineering. And so, that could be an area of focus or perhaps maybe it's not an academic area, but it's the kinds of things that h2o and Data Robot and companies like that can build into their products.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, that's so interesting. So if you roll back ten years or you took a competition at the start of Kaggle and then you take it out today, how much better do people do? Do they even do better? Do you think you could win? Could you take modern tools and win every competition at the start of Kaggle? I guess my question is, has the feature engineering really improved?</p><p><strong>Anthony: </strong>So the thing when Kaggle first got started, people used to use all sorts of things like support vector machines, self-organizing maps, really a large range of things. The first big development that we saw or the first big contribution I think Kaggle made is we made it very clear that Random Forest was the best algorithm for actually most problems at that time, and then, let's say about 2014, Tianqi Chen at the University of Washington released XGBoost. I think it was always thought that gradient boosting machines should be better, you know. It's a very smart approach to run someway decision trees. They should be better. They're very, very finicky before XGBoost. When Tianqi Chen launched XGBoost, &nbsp;it really took over from Random Forest. I'd say, unlike the difference between deep neural networks on computer vision problems versus Random Forest, the XGBoost increase is not a huge increase, but it was enough. And so, to be honest, unstructured data problems, I think that's probably where most of the software driven improvements have come from. It's probably the case if you took a problem from the early days of Kaggle, that was one with Random Forest and you reran it today, I think you'd get a little bit of a better answer because of the XGBoost. I don't actually think the way people are doing feature engineering has really improved very much. However, I do think that you would get.. What we always say is that Kaggle competitions, typically, you know, the top teams all converge on about the same level of accuracy and the intuition there is there's only so much signal in a dataset, right? And so people compete to the point where they've extracted all the signal. So I believe in the early Kaggle competitions, people always found that the key features and they got all the signal out of the dataset. I think what might happen is it had happened a fair bit faster now. If you think of professional athletes, they do a lot of training, Kaggle's communities are over five million people now. The people at the top are.. It's just like gone from more of an amateur sport to more of a professional sport, right? And so I think the difference isn't that the results would be better, but the top performers now would get to those results faster interestingly is my guess. Definitely. We ran a challenge with Pete Warden who's now at Google. He was running a company called Jetback and I think it was to distinguish competition between cats versus dogs and I think we did that, if I remember correctly, we did that before deep neural networks and afterwards and obviously saw a fairly big lift. We ran a challenge with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence on solving an eighth grade science quiz. This was before the BERT innovations. People were getting about 60% accuracy using information retrieval methods. Allen have now run BERT-wide solutions on it. They're getting about 90%. So you definitely see... The before Deep Learning and after Deep Learning, you see very large changes in results for sure.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>And I would think that on some unstructured data like language models and things would really make a big difference, right?</p><p><strong>Anthony: </strong>Yeah. I mean so you definitely have structured data where you have fields that are text fields, et cetera, et cetera. And so maybe you use language models to create features that ultimately go into.. I mean, that's a common strategy. We run multimodel competitions sometimes where you have images and someone will run a convolutional neural network in order to come out with features out of that image, that then get fed into a gradient boosting machine classifier. So that definitely happened. And so just as it gets done.. For images that might be part of a multimodel dataset, of course, it can happen as well when there are columns that are text or data sources for a challenge that are text.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Are there interesting data augmentation strategies that you see people using? I feel like often people talk about that as a major area of innovation, and so do you see that on Kaggle?</p><p><strong>Anthony: </strong>There's a couple of ways people win Kaggle competitions. In the world of structured data problems, it's clever feature engineering. It's very often that, let's say for natural language processing or for computer vision problems, it's clever data augmentation that wins competitions. And some of my favorite example is the Kaggle community is really creative. I remember I think it was with Quora, we did a challenge around detecting insincere questions. I think that was the challenge and the winning strategy there or the thing that the winners did that others didn't do is that would translate the question from English to some other language and then translate it back, because if you use Google Translate, it's not a symmetrical translation, right? And so it was like a clever way to augment that dataset. So there are the standard techniques, you know, rotating, et cetera, for images. But then there are clever, creative tricks like that translation lap. There have also been a bunch of, you know, one of the libraries that has really taken off on Kaggle, I think was written by a Kaggle master. It's called …</p></div></div>

</address><p>Parliamentarians in the Senate rapidly passed a wide-ranging set of financial and corporate law reforms on Thursday. The so-called “Blockchain Act” had sailed through the House of Representatives unopposed in the summer, meaning the law will likely come into effect early next year.</p><p>The legislation could open the doors not just to decentralised finance but also the creation of digital company shares and a range of other tradeable assets.</p><p>Several existing laws have been updated, ranging from company bankruptcy to securities trading. Neighbouring Liechtenstein has already enacted extensive blockchain legislation, but it chose to create new laws rather than amend the current code.</p><p>The growing Swiss blockchain industry has welcomed the legislation. “As of next year, Switzerland will have a regulatory framework that is among the most advanced in the world,” said Heinz Tännler, President of the Swiss Blockchain Federation.</p>

<p>Some 900 blockchain companies, employing around 4,700 staff, have sprung up in “Crypto Nation” Switzerland in the last few years. These include crypto banks, asset managers, real estate ventures, alpine cryptocurrency vaults, a variety of different blockchains, upcoming digital stock exchanges and an array of digital currency projects, such as Libra.</p><p>The legal code has now caught up with blockchain – otherwise known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><h2>Banks paying attention</h2><p>It sets a firm legal basis for exchanging digital-only securities and for reclaiming digital assets from bankrupt companies. It also sets legal standards for crypto trading exchanges and tackles the threat of money laundering using cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Swiss banks have for years been wary of cryptocurrencies and blockchain upstarts, fearing a new wave of money laundering headaches. A Wild West phase of blockchain start-up crowd funding in 2017 and 2018 left many investors unhappy with their return or defrauded. As a result, it’s still difficult for some Swiss blockchain start-ups to get a bank account.</p><p>But banks are also taking note of new potential to disrupt finance. If they ignore such possibilities, they risk losing out to competitors such as Sygnum or SEBA – granted banking licenses last year.</p>
<p>UBS and Credit Suisse are testing the potential of DLT trading and are part of a consortium behind a digital payment token project to settle trades faster. Julius Bär has a partnership with SEBA crypto bank and Vontobel issues cryptocurrency-backed trading certificates on the Swiss stock exchange.</p><p>Private banks such as Maerki Baumann and Arab Bank Switzerland offer cryptocurrency services to wealthy clients, usually through intermediates such as Bitcoin Suisse, Metaco or Taurus.</p><p>But the Swiss law changes are just as important for the creation of digital-only versions of company shares, real estate holdings, art and other assets that can be listed and traded on blockchains. It remains to be seen if the reformed Swiss legal code will provide real momentum for the industry.</p><div role="region" aria-label="Infobox"><p><strong>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</strong></p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2008 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.
