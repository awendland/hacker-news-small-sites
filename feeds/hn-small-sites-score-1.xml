</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>

<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

    <article>
      
      <time datetime="2020-11-09 00:00:00">November 9, 2020</time>
      <p>On the internet, there is no shortage of good quality <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generators</a> (SSGâ€™s) that you can download for free. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hundreds of others are readily available. And they work. You can build all kinds of sites with them. I know that, because Iâ€™ve used some of them. Hugo was the driving force behind this website until very recently. Despite that, when I tried to add a new section a while ago, I got rather frustrated with it and decided to build my own generator. It turned out to be a very pleasant experience and not just because I like to program things.</p>
<p>While working on it, I discovered some of the deeper motivations that drove me to undertake this project. On the surface it would seem an odd thing to do, because it takes a lot of time and it appears to offer little benefit. I did not create any new or spectacular functionality. If you click around this site and think: Hey, but I could totally make this with &lt;SSG of choice&gt;, then you would probably be right. But that is not the point. There are certain advantages to making it all yourself and I suspect that these advantages trancend the subject of SSGâ€™s and programming. My speculation is that exploring this direction might also be interesting for people who do not like to program, or maybe even for those who donâ€™t like computers that much at all.</p>
<p>So, why choose this project out so many others that all sound so much more interesting? It is easy to summarize, but without some context it may sound a bit abstract. The real reason for all this work is that I think that a personal site should be personal and to make it personal, one should solely be guided by oneâ€™s intuition and not by the mental models of available tools and the restrictions they impose on your thoughts.</p>
<p>That probably sounded vague and perhaps a little far fetched. After all, as long as you can write the words you want to write, draw the lines you want to draw, you are not limited in your creativity, right? Maybe you are. To make the point more tangible, let me expand on my own situation for a bit. I wil focus on Hugo, since that is the SSG I know best. But the same principles hold for other generators. All other tools even, I believe.</p>
<h2>Metadata and Organising Thoughts</h2>
<p>As said, the list of available static site generators is endless. But somehow they all seem to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> as markup language to write your posts in. Markdown is very easy to learn and that is probably the reason why it is so popular. Unfortunately, it is a pretty bad markup language for this use case, as it is very incomplete. It is not really a language. Markdown is better seen as a bunch of shortcuts to simplify writing a few common HTML tags. Out of the box you can only sort of markup the body of a document with it. Titles, paragraphs, lists, etc. But not more than that. As we are dealing with a website, shortcuts for HTML tags can be useful, but we need more. For instance, one also needs metadata, like tags, publishing dates, etc. You do want the latest post to be at the top of the newsfeed, right? Then we must find a way to indicate the time when a post was published.</p>
<p>In Hugo this is solved with the awkward concept of <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">frontmatter</a>. At the top of each Markdown file, one needs to add a block of text that is not Markdown, but another format. You can pick either YAML, TOML, or JSON. In that block you can specify the things I mentioned. Publishing date, author, category, etc. It is all very flexible, you can even define your own metadata. So you can definitely make a nice looking site out of this.</p>
<p>But the downside is that any blog or article you write is now tied to the system that you use to publish it. Frontmatter is not part of Markdown. It is part of Hugo. So other Markdown tools will not be able to extract that info. Only Hugo can. So if you, like me, like to write all kinds of things, and you want to have some of your writings to end up on your site and others not, a decision that is perhaps made even only after youâ€™ve done the writing, then you have just created a problem. Because now you have to make two piles of writing. One pile for texts that will be published on your site, and another for text that you want to export to, say, PDF. But wait, maybe you <em>also</em> want to compile a selection of your stories and make it into an ebook. And maybe you are really proud of a piece and you want to publish it all three ways at once. It becomes a bit weird, and also very impractical, to store your work then. Are you going to change the document format each time you want to make an export? Are you going to make multiple copies? What happens if you find a spelling error later? This all quickly becomes a big mess.</p>
<p>Ideally, I want to have one folder for storing all my writing. I want to organize that folder the way I think fits best with the content. Then I want to point the site generator to that folder and it should figure out the rest by itself. What needs to be published on my site? Where should it end up? The metadata should be all that is needed to figure it out. And I want the same thing to be true for all other publishers, generators, indexers, etc. that I use, or may want to use in the future. The only solution is then to store your texts in open, tool agnostic document format that can hold all the relevant info. Preferably a plain text format too. Because that part of Markdown I do like. Using simple text editors, Git version control, yes, give me that.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>. A Markdown so structured and complete that you can write a whole book in it. Yet is has the same simple way of adding markup and it looks very similar. I will write another post later on how I used a subset of Asciidoc to make my generator. The point I want to make here is that a simple, in my opinion very reasonable requirement to not want to be forced to reorganise and duplicate my files in an illogical way, already rules out 90% of the available tools. And, conversely, that merely by adopting one of those existing tools, you have suddenly become a bit restricted in the way you can think about your creative work.</p>
<p>Think about it. The moment you start anything, the moment where the ideas in your head are not more than undefined glimpses of images or feelings. The moment you have to concentrate really hard to not let the fleeting, still wordless impressions slip. Blink your eyes one time too many and they will be lost, floated away. On <em>that</em> very moment, you get bothered by the question â€œWhere should this end up, once it is finished? Is it a note for my diary, or a book?â€�  That is totally backwards. That should not be the first question about your work, but the last. Not everyone is the same, but for me this upfront question is limiting. Thoughts that are not mature enough to be categorized, are forced to materialize in anyway, so you can put them in the right bucket. And then they slip away.</p>
<h2>Blank Page Instead of Puzzles and Pieces</h2>
<p>By now, some pepole might be thinking: yes, that is all fine, but some generators, like Hugo <em>can</em> use Asciidoc as input and you <em>can</em> set an alternative content path. Surely you can work something out here and configure things the way it suits you?</p>
<p>Well, yes, from the face of it, it might be possible to cobble something up. But that is not going to end up well. Going that route, you will get dragged down in an endless cycle of figuring out options and options of options and in the end, you will be happy to get anything on the screen at all.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s start simple. Some generators say they support Asciidoc, but they donâ€™t do that nativly. At least the ones Iâ€™ve seen. That is, you have to install another piece of software to get the functionality. In this case <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>. (And Asciidocter in turn requires Ruby, but I think it ends there.) Then the two pieces must be configured to work together and this must be done on overy device you want to use. This is what developers call a dependency and they are to be avoided wherever possible, as they require you to do work, just to keep things running as they are. At the time of writing you can read <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#additional-formats-through-external-helpers">this</a> in the Hugo documentation on how to configure Asciidoc:</p>
<p><em>â€œAsciiDoc implementation EOLs in Jan 2020 and is no longer supported. AsciiDoc development is being continued under Asciidoctor. The format AsciiDoc remains of course. Please continue with the implementation Asciidoctor.â€�</em></p>
<p>So what this says is that the people behind Hugo saw that a piece of software they relied on, AsciiDoc, was going to be outdated so they switched to another piece of external software, Asciidoctor, to prevent things from breaking. A sensible move. But for you, the user, things are now already broken, because now you have remove the first piece of software, install the second, and configure things again to make them work together. And again, this must be done on all your devices. You get to choose between options, but the options are not stable and require work by you, the user. Sometimes the options have some dependencies themselves, repeating the problem. Not a fun way to spend an afternoon.</p>
<p>But enough about Asciidoc. Letâ€™s talk about templates.</p>
<p>It is wellknown that Hugo has a difficult templating language. This is because Hugo is built in Go and leverages the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">template functionality</a> of the Go standard library. That functionality is fast and elegant, but very much geared to programmers. I knew this beforehand, but since I am a Go developer, I figured this would be an advantage, not a disadvantage. I do this Go stuff all day. It has payed for the laptop I am writing on right now and the chair I am sitting in. Surely this will be easy?</p>
<p>Not so much. Writing Hugo templates turned out to be a moderately frustrating experience. It was an endless game of guessing variables, types and trying to combine them into something useful by chaining functions. There is documentation, every variable and function is listed, but a crucial thing is missing: the big …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

People love the idea of a new gadget that they “need” to buy, in this case, to get fit, but the question of whether or not these devices actually work is definitely up for debate.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-1n80q"><span><strong>What science is saying</strong> </span></h3><p id="viewer-at776"><span>There have been several studies that have discovered that fitness trackers won't necessarily help you get fit faster than simply doing it on your own.</span></p><p id="viewer-e71cl"><span>In 2016, the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2553448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</u></a> published a 2-year study from the University of Pittsburgh, aimed at comparing “technology-enhanced weight loss” (with the use of fitness trackers) to “standard behavioural weight loss” (without trackers).</span></p><p id="viewer-9t0rj"><span>Over 24 months, 470 adults participated in the study (233 in the standard group, 237 in the enhanced group).

</span></p><h3 id="viewer-c7o16"><span>How to interpret the results?</span></h3><p id="viewer-fggdn"><span>So both these studies have come back with some pretty negative results, how did this happen?</span></p><p id="viewer-9ceo0"><span>Well according to the lead author on the Pittsburgh study, John Jakicic:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-8s0cb"><span>“These technologies are focused on physical activity, like taking steps and getting your heart rate up, people would say, 'Oh, I exercised a lot today, now I can eat more.'

This is understandable but surely there must be a reason so many people have invested in smart trackers other than our obsession with wearable tech?</span></p><p id="viewer-rnti"><span>
The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure! But if you’re expecting the equivalent of a personal coach on your wrist then think again.</span></p><div id="viewer-ei9pb"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ldtr"><span>However, these companies are making efforts to improve the motivation aspect to their devices, like <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Apple’s activity rings</u></a>, or some devices allowing you to compare your data to your friends and family.

<p>New ideas are always exciting. We get hands-on and start building too early, only to lose interest later.</p>



<p>Here is a list of questions I currently use to reflect on ideas before I build them.</p>



<p><strong>Who am I building for?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Where can I find them?</li><li>Do I have easy access to where they are?</li><li>Can I describe the my potential users in a short sentence?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What problems do they have today?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Can I explain the problem in simple words?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What is my solution?</strong></p>



<ul><li>What do I have to build?</li><li>Is it technically feasible and possible?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What is the current state?</strong></p>



<ul><li>How do people solve it today?</li><li>Who are the competitors? What is wrong with them?</li><li>Is my solution so much better to make them try it?</li><li>Have someone else tried this before?</li><li>What are the reasons for people to not use this? Can I solve this?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Why is now the best time to do this?</li><li>Why haven’t anyone thought of this before?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Is this for me?</strong></p>



<ul><li>What is my unfair advantage?</li><li>Is this something I want to do for next 10 years of my life?</li><li>Does it align with my personal vision?</li></ul>



<p>Answering all that question might take a lot of time. But thinking about these things will give you more time to reflect on the idea and decide if it is worth pursuing.</p>

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<p><span>"Storing and querying datasets that contain objects in a geometric space have always required special treatment. The choice of data structures and query algorithms can easily make the difference between a query that runs in seconds or in days.“</span> (Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/08/spatial-databases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/08/spatial-databases.html</a>)</p>
<p>Mireo has been in the vehicle tracking business since 2001 and during that time we have learned many valuable lessons. One of the most important ones is that these systems usually don't scale. What does this mean? As the number of records exceeds a few billion mark, the processing of data requires exponentially more time. This is true for all systems processing data produced by moving objects, but which are not designed as natively horizontally scalable.</p>
<p>In the late summer of 2014, we got an interesting and challenging business proposal –&nbsp; to design and develop a system capable of live tracking 2 million trucks and storing their log history for a period of 5 years. Can you imagine the amount of spatiotemporal data we would need to store and process? In order to correctly perform the map-matching process (i.e. detect the road where the vehicle is currently located, based on its imprecise GPS position), a vehicle needs to send its GPS positions relatively frequently. For the sake of simplicity, let's approximate this with ”1 position every 3 seconds“ while a vehicle is driving. Now, let's do the math:</p>
<p>2.000.000 vehicles</p>
<p>x 1.200 GPS positions per vehicle per hour</p>
<p>x 5 years</p>
<p>= 105.120.000.000.000 positions</p>
<p>Yes, that's more than <strong>105 trillion</strong>. Needless to say, our old vehicle tracking system that relies on the combination of relational and NoSQL databases would fall apart under such amount of data. Additionally, the new system was required to be able to resolve queries such as ”<em><strong>fetch the total number of truck visits to the specified factory“.</strong></em></p>
<p>There were several difficult problems to be solved in order to fulfill this kind of business proposal, such as load distribution, map-matching, networking (tracking 2 million vehicles means 2 million permanently open TCP connections). However, the most difficult one was definitely choosing the right storage. Where should we store the data? To a file system? To a relational database? To a NoSQL database? To a general-purpose object storage like Hadoop? Each of the mentioned options presented problems of its own: traditional relational SQL databases are not designed as distributed and horizontally scalable, NoSQL key-value databases have records with the same index dispersed around the disk (performance killer!), with clustered file systems (Ceph, GlusterFS, HDFS..) it is not possible to use maximal disk bandwidth with the level of abstraction which those file systems bring, etc.</p>
<p>The storing of data needed to be efficient, but the most important was to provide <strong>fast searching.</strong> For example, the execution time of the query <em><strong>”fetch all positions and timestamps when specified 4 trucks met each other“</strong></em> could not exceed few seconds in the worst case scenario. Additionally, we wanted to have the possibility to make OLAP-like queries, grouping, joining... In other words, some special kind of relational-like database would be the best choice. But which one? We had to do some serious brainstorming.</p>
<ul>
<li>we needed a relational-like database with an excellent spatiotemporal index and appropriate query language</li>
<li>we needed to store <strong>n-dimensional</strong> data sets – how would one sort such data?</li>
<li>distribution of data from ”real world“ was highly non-uniform – we would get a lot of data from the crowded areas with many vehicles, and a small amount of data from rural areas</li>
</ul>
<p>A mantra in the software engineering world is ”don't reinvent the wheel“. Naturally, we started to analyze current state-of-the-art solutions for processing massive spatiotemporal data. Besides the other obvious properties of such a system, we quickly figured out that the most critical part was the way in which the system would index multidimensional data. It turned out that there were three major multidimensional index types used in major spatial systems: R-tree family of trees (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, MemSQL, ...), kd-tree family (Oracle Spatial Quad tree index) and Geohash (GeoMesa and various variants of products found on Google Cloud). Guess what? None of these solutions is suitable for indexing a huge amount of real-world spatiotemporal data! Let's see why.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned non-uniform data distribution, R-tree family of indexes is practically useless on a large scale because index traversal over high-density areas effectively becomes linear. A similar, but much worse effect would happen with fixed-grid space/time partition indexes like Geohash. The index traversal on high-density areas with Geohash would again become very linear with no possibility for more granular partitioning. To make things worse, Geohash-based indexes could in theory yield good record filtering only if range queries are finitely bounded by all dimensions. For example, in the context of a vehicle tracking system, it is natural to store and index triplets having vehicle ID, timestamp and location. Then, trying to execute a simple query of the form <em><strong>“fetch full history for one single vehicle for the period of one year“</strong></em> using Geohash would effectively linearly scan the complete database because the query is bounded by vehicle ID and timestamp, but not by location!</p>
<p>kd-tree family of indexes are the most efficient type of indexing n-dimensional interval data, but with one huge drawback – they are built on the top of static data sets. It would be possible to efficiently index even a large interval data set using kd-tree type of index, but only if the underlying recordset would not change afterwards. There had been attempts in scientific literature to loosen this requirement, but to the best of our knowledge, there was no commercially available system using some of those approaches. In our scenario, new data would keep arriving all the time so static data sets were not an option.</p>
<p>To wrap up, the system capable of storing and analyzing a large amount of spatiotemporal real-time data had to contain at least the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>it had to be designed from the ground up as <strong>clustered, distributed system</strong> with data processing modules deployed as close as possible to the physical data storage (in other words, traditional RDMBS are useless for this purpose)</li>
<li>it had to be <strong>highly available, fault-tolerant and natively horizontally scalable</strong></li>
<li><strong>the index on spatiotemporal records was by far the most important ingredient of an efficient spatiotemporal database processing system;</strong> as we saw, none of the current state-of-the-art spatiotemporal indexes was suitable for dealing with a large amount of records coming from moving objects</li>
<li><strong>partitioning scheme had to exploit spatiotemporal properties of the underlying data</strong> - records that are close (based on vehicle ID, position and timestamp) needed to be in the same or adjacent shards</li>
</ol>
<p>We had to come up with something new, something absurdly fast and massively scalable. After 5 years of hard work by the group of extremely talented people, we are proud to present <strong><a href="https://www.mireo.hr/spacetime">Mireo SpaceTime Cluster</a></strong>.

<p>There’s a neat variation on open-addressing based hash tables called <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcs.uwaterloo.ca%2Fresearch%2Ftr%2F1986%2FCS-86-14.pdf&amp;ei=RJqJUcHZH8HuigKGsoHQDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyXJn73zNas94y_yK55dv--oMmbg&amp;sig2=CRV_bivIwvFsw8c2wz5ZwQ&amp;bvm=bv.46226182,d.cGE">Robin Hood hashing</a>. This technique isn’t very well-known, but it makes a huge practical difference because it both improves performance and space utilization compared to other “standard” hash tables (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">chaining</a>). It also eliminates the major downside of other open addressing hash tables.</p>

<p>Here are the benefits, summarized:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High load factors can be used without seriously affecting performance. 0.9 is perfectly reasonable as a default (0.95 or higher works too, it mainly affects insertion cost a bit).</p></li>

<li><p>No linked lists or other extra pointers. This reduces cache misses and storage overhead. Your underlying structure can be a simple flat array since it’s just open addressing under the hood.</p></li>

<li><p>Lookup and insertion logic is fast. Again, no linked lists to traverse or other complications, just a linear probe sequence with a few checks per element.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For a simple benchmark where I inserted 100k english words into a map, then deleted 10% of them, and then looked them all up again, the timings for my simple Robin Hood hash table was <strong>23%</strong>, <strong>66%</strong> and **25% **lower for insertions, deletions and lookups respectively compared to the VS 2012 std::unordered_map, it did this using <strong>30%</strong> less memory overall.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-variance">It’s all about the variance</h2>

<p>So the basic idea is to take normal open addressing, but use one clever trick in order to drastically reduce the variance of the expected average and maximum probe lengths. We’ll se later why reducing variance is so important. To give you an idea how Robin Hood Hashing improves things, the probe length variance for a RH table at a load factor of 0.9 is 0.98, whereas for a normal open addressing scheme it’s 16.2. At a load factor of 0.99 it’s 1.87 and 194 respectively.</p>

<p><strong>The clever trick is just this</strong>: when you probe for a position to insert a new element, if the probe length for the existing element is less than the current probe length for the element being inserted, swap the two elements and keep going.</p>

<p>That way elements that were inserted early and thus “lucked out” on their probe lengths, will gradually be moved away from their preferred slot as new elements come in that could make better use of that place in the table (hence the name - the insertion “takes from the rich”, i.e. the elements with low probe counts). It leads to an “evening out” of the probe lengths.</p>

<p>Why is low variance better? Well, with modern cache architectures a probe count of 1 isn’t really much faster than a probe count of 3, because the main cost is fetching the cache line, so the ideal scenario is for all elements to have the same probe count, and having that probe count fitting within one cache line.</p>

<p>It turns out that Robin Hood hashing has the same expected probe count as normal open addressing (about 2.55) - it just has substantially less variance, and therefore ends up with far fewer cache misses. Yes, there are fewer elements that can early out after 1 probe, but there also far fewer elements that end up needing to fetch multiple cache lines because of long probe lengths.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the expected value of the <em>longest</em> probe sequence approaches about 6 for a load of 0.9 (it’s not actually constant, but grows very, very slowly - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fsummary%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.130.6339&amp;ei=RJqJUcHZH8HuigKGsoHQDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFquQO-Wa7uCGLwFTdLKpEHDBGsig&amp;sig2=DfIIJzRj2YXIRyLiHGCHUA&amp;bvm=bv.46226182,d.cGE">see this paper</a>), which is pretty reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-failed-lookups">What about failed lookups?</h2>

<p>So now you’re probably thinking that this sounds good, but in the back of your mind you know that normal open addressing tables do pretty well too, but have a major downside in that searching for non-existing elements is troublesome to handle. To allay your fears I’ll first tell you a very simple (but totally practical) solution that is enabled by the low variance, and then we’ll see the even better version later.</p>

<p>First a recap. The usual problem is this: since the search algorithm terminates when you find an “empty” slot in the underlying array, it can take a very long time to determine that an element doesn’t exist in the array when the table grows full.</p>

<p>How does Robin Hood hashing solve this? Well the simplest solution is to exploit the fact that the expected longest probe count is low (~6). Just modify the standard search algorithm to ignore empty slots (rather than terminate the search) and keep going until you’ve probed longer than the known maximum probe length for the whole table. This maximum probe length will be small, with a very high probability, even for very loaded tables.</p>

<p>This solution would obviously be inefficient for the standard open addressing scheme, since the expected longest probe count is much higher (e.g. at a load of 0.9 and ~64K elems it&nbsp;is about 70).</p>

<h2 id="the-details">The details</h2>

<p>In order to know what the probe count of an existing element is (which is key to the algorithm) we could just re-hash the element to re-compute its “desired” slot index and then subtract this from its actual location. A faster way is to simply cache the hash value for each key.</p>

<p>Storing the hash value is generally a sensible strategy anyway, because it means you have a fast early-out for comparisons, so we take that approach here. In other words, the hash table elements consist of a 32 bit hash value, the key, and the value. For my implementation I stored the hash values in a separate array in order to get more hash probes per cache line (at the expense of a second mandatory cache miss to actually fetch the key). This gave a small speed-up for my test where the key size was large (sizeof(std::string)), but there’s a #define in the code to put the hash value alongside its key.</p>

<p>In order to indicate that a slot is unused, we modify the hash function to never return 0, and use a stored hash value of 0 to mean “uninitialized slot”.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the insertion algorithm, since this is where the actual Robin Hood trick comes in.</p>

<p>The algorithm is pretty simple. We simply loop until we’ve found an uninitialized slot (hash value == 0). If we found an existing slot whose probe distance is less than our current probe count (‘dist’), we swap places and continue.
Note: using move semantics here matters (e.g. for efficient swapping).</p>

<p>In order to delete an element, we follow the same strategy as for normal open addressing and mark the slot as a tombstone. Tombstones are treated specially in the insert algorithm. We overwrite the tombstone only when we would’ve wanted to swap anyway (see the check for is_deleted above).</p>

<p>We must mark&nbsp;the tombstone&nbsp;using a whole bit rather than just reserving a single hash value (like we did for uninitialized slots), because we need to know the probe count of the tombstone.</p>

<p>This just finds the desired position of the element using the hash, then probes linearly from there on in. There are two conditions to signify that the element doesn’t exist, and finally one check to see if we’ve found the element.</p>

<p>The first exit condition checks for completely uninitialized elements. This is because if the element we are looking for had probed an uninitialized slot during insertion, it would have simply been place there. So the existence of an uninitialized slot along our probe sequence means the element must not be in the table.</p>

<p>The second condition is more interesting. This is our replacement for simple checking the probe distance against a table-wide maximum probe count. We <em>know</em> that when we probe an element during insertion, the one with the longer probe count of the two gets to keep the slot. So if we’re looking for an element that exists,&nbsp;we should expect to never see an existing element with a shorter probe count then our current count (if that <em>had</em> happened, there would’ve been a swap during insertion!).</p>

<p>In other words, we early out as soon as our current probe count exceeds the probe count of the stored element. Since the average probe count for stored elements is 2.55, we can exit pretty quickly for non-existent elements (much earlier than stopping after a table-wide maximum probe count).</p>

<p>This second condition is why we need to maintain the hash value even for tomb stones. Imagine what would happen if we simply marked the slot as uninitialized when it was …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</span><span>

	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

For example, it integrates with the rest of the home security system — using machine learning to identify humans, cars, animals, and more:</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg.webp 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg.webp 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg.webp 442w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" alt="DIY smart doorbell detects a guest visitor with AI computer vision" width="1024" height="1024" title="Detecting a person approaching" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x1024.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w"></picture><figcaption>The smart doorbell uses TensorFlow to detect people, cars, animals, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><h2><span id="Designing_the_Smart_Doorbell"></span>Designing the Smart Doorbell<span></span></h2><p>Doorbells live outside.</p><p>Okay, that’s obvious. But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<p>We are not alone in believing in the idea of a cloudless IoT. In the IoT community, the concept is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing" target="_blank">edge</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing" target="_blank">fog</a> computing. There are entire software platforms, such as the <a href="https://litmusautomation.com/en/loopedge/" target="_blank">Litmus LoopEdge platform</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Edge</a>, and the <a href="https://crosser.io/solutions/iot-edge-analytics/" target="_blank">Crosser IoT edge analytics suite</a>, that are built to run off the grid. There are even custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/" target="_blank">hardware chips</a> designed to support off-the-cloud computation, usually speech&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p>There also an old adage that <i>the Internet of things without the Internet is just … things</i>. This is not true: there are many situations where IoT systems without Internet can be as valuable as Internet-enabled IoT&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>We at Thingsquare have built and deployed several cloudless IoT systems with the no-cloud version of our IoT platform,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrical generators</strong>. These are deployed in a remote location where there is little or no Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial machinery</strong>. These are deployed as a completely standalone product with a separate touch screen on the local&nbsp;controller.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial lighting</strong>. These are run in places where customers want a completely siloed&nbsp;system.</li>
</ul>

<p>But let’s first look at why we use the cloud at all. Because there are good reasons for doing&nbsp;so.</p>

<h2 id="why-iot-in-the-cloud-">Why IoT in the&nbsp;cloud?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons for why the backend logic of an IoT system is run in the&nbsp;cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data storage</strong>: The cloud can store an almost unlimited amount of&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Computation</strong>: Some mechanisms needs an abundance of computational power, which is something that the cloud can provide an almost unlimited amount&nbsp;of.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: To provide users with remote access to the data generated by the IoT devices, or to control the devices themselves, you need to have a cloud service that connects the devices with their&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Access control</strong>: The cloud can provide effective access control mechanisms for your&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Data cross-referencing</strong>: To be able to run effective machine learning algorithms, you sometimes need access to a wide range of data. The cloud lets you collect data from more than one site to cross-reference and combine this&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Application integration</strong>: IoT systems rarely run on their own. Integration with other software systems is much easier if the backend is located in a single place: the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Security updates</strong>: when the IoT backend is run in the cloud, a dedicated security team can keep track of and apply security updates as&nbsp;needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reasons, which are good reasons, are why most IoT systems today are provided through the cloud. Thingsquare is no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>The backend portion of the <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/iot-platform/">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> is originally designed to be run in the cloud. Sometimes the backend is running on a typical cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, and sometimes the backend is installed on a hosted machine, as a traditional on-premise software&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>But the running the IoT backend in cloud does come with some&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloudless-iot-">Why cloudless&nbsp;IoT?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to not rely on an always-on cloud connection for every IoT&nbsp;project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: cloud services may go down so avoiding the cloud may therefore increase&nbsp;stability.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong>: cloud services may go away so avoiding the cloud may allow the IoT system to run for ever, without relying on the hosting company to&nbsp;persist.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: sometimes data should not leave the location where it is&nbsp;generated.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: fewer network connections means fewer attack&nbsp;vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity</strong>: sometimes there just isn’t Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any cloud-based software may become unreachable if the cloud goes down. This can happen even for <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/google-cloud-down" target="_blank">companies like Google</a>, who arguably has state-of-the-art cloud infrastructures and one of the best cloud teams in the world. Any IoT solution that wholly depends on the cloud will suffer an outage if the cloud goes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Because the cloud service is a living thing, it may die. This can happen if the company that runs the service goes away or if it simply decides that it is no longer economical to keep it running. There are several <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/best-buys-iot-goes-dark-leaving-some-smart-products-dumbfounded/">real-world</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11362928/google-nest-revolv-shutdown-smart-home-products">examples</a> of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>But the most compelling reason to why use a cloudless IoT system is when Internet access is unavailable. At Thingsquare, we have been working with projects where the IoT system is deployed in rural Africa, where Internet access is spotty at best. And with projects in countries Internet access has been generally available, but where the IoT system has been inside a deep cellar where 4G access was&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-cloudless-iot">The challenges of cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Moving the IoT backend away from the cloud, closer to the IoT devices presents a number of&nbsp;challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: authentication is significantly easier with the cloud, thanks to mechanisms such as 2 factor&nbsp;authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: providing remote access without the cloud is very difficult and in most cases&nbsp;impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: crunching numbers without having access to the abundance of storage and computation that the cloud provides is significantly&nbsp;harder.</li>
<li><strong>Software deployment</strong>: many IoT systems need data processing or similar mechanisms, and these systems are often designed to be run in the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Software updates</strong>: software is a living thing and needs to be kept up to&nbsp;date.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues result in trade-offs. Any IoT system that is deployed away from the cloud must be prepared to deal with&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="a-practical-approach-to-a-cloudless-iot">A practical approach to a cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Thingsquare takes a deliberately simple approach to the cloudless&nbsp;IoT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run our IoT backend on a non-connected local&nbsp;controller</li>
<li>Deal with resulting the trade-offs on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis</li>
</ul>
<p>The local controller can run on a piece of hardware similar to a Raspberry Pi. The local controller is deployed on an on-site network and we provide a user interface over that network only. The user interface is accessible through a smartphone app, which can detect nearby local controllers via Bluetooth, and let users interact with&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>The backend logic of the IoT application, which would normally run in the cloud, also runs on the local controller. This also means that the backend application must be scaled down to the limits of a Raspberry Pi-class&nbsp;device.</p>

</div>


<p>Since we cannot expect the local controller hardware to be as robust as a cloud host, particularly if the local controller is based on an <span>SD</span> drive, we limit disk writes by storing volatile data in memory. This means that software that runs on top of the API must be prepared to deal with having access to less&nbsp;data.</p>
<h3 id="user-authentication">User&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>To authenticate users, we use a two-tiered approach. The first tier is to leverage the existing access control to the local WiFi. If a user is authenticated to the local WiFi, this tier assumes that the user also should have access to the local controller and its devices. It is possible to configure the access level that such non-authenticated local users should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>The second tier uses a hybrid approach: we use the cloud to authenticate the user and provide an access token to the local controller. The local controller announces its presence with encrypted Bluetooth beacons that the smartphone app uses to authenticate each user. This requires the users to have an account in the cloud. The app checks with the cloud server to match the encrypted beacon and the user account. If the user has access, the server responds with an access key to the local&nbsp;controller.</p>
<h3 id="device-authentication">Device&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>Device authentication is comparatively easier than user authentication, because devices can be preprogrammed with <span>TLS</span> certificates. We&nbsp;there</p>
<h3 id="software-delivery-with-a-git-repository">Software delivery with a git&nbsp;repository</h3>
<p>We deliver all software over a managed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git repository</a>. This repository can be updated by connecting the local controller to the Internet and requesting an update, or manually via a <span>USB</span>&nbsp;stick.</p>

For offline local controllers, software updates are provided via git repository, either distributed automatically via a temporary network connection or manually with a <span>USB</span> stick.

<h3 id="firmware-updates">Firmware&nbsp;updates</h3>
<p>Signed firmware update files are included in the git repository. Devices may request updates from the local controller, just as they do when they are connected to a cloud&nbsp;backend.</p>
<p>Because we use the full IoT backend software, <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/network-updates">full-network <span>OTA</span> updates</a> work as&nbsp;usual.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User&nbsp;interface</h3>
<p>The local controller may present a user interface with a touch screen physically connected to the controller, or over the WiFi to smartphone apps on the same network. By default, the user interface is implemented via <span>HTML5</span>/JS/CSS and is updated via the git&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The cloud is an integral part of the Internet of Things. But there are situations in which the cloud is not the best&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Thingsquare provides a local, cloudless IoT solution, based on the same software that is backing our cloud-based offering, that solves the problems with software delivery, user interface access, and firmware updates for the cloudless&nbsp;IoT.</p>

<p>“On the eve of the next generation” of game consoles (the new Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X), <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, in issue #352 (Christmas 2020 issue), is running an article entitled “Games Of The Generation.” The piece includes a variety of industry notables sharing their pick of a game released since the arrival of the PS4 and Xbox One worthy to receive this title.</p>



<p>The list is comprised of 20 games, their advocates describing their reasons for bestowing such singular note upon them. Some are extremely well known — <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Ico</em> — while others are less so. And among them is Hello Games’ <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“…our Games Of The Generation awards go to the crème de la crème — those Edge has judged to represent the pinnacle of game design as we know it today.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Within, legendary developer and founder of Llamasoft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Minter">Jeff Minter</a>, has named <em><a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/">No Man’s Sky</a></em> his Game Of The Generation. With a development career that began in 1981 with titles for the Sinclair ZX80 micro, Minter is known for a great many (and frequently psychedelic) titles across many platforms, including 8 and 16-bit Ataris, C64, Amiga, Nuon, PC, iOS, Xbox 360, and PS4. Some of his most notable titles include <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gridrunner">Gridrunner</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Bovver">Hover Bovver</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Mutant_Camels">Attack of the Mutant Camels</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_(light_synthesizer)">the Virtual Light Machine/Neon</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Giraffe">Space Giraffe</a>; <a href="https://bytecellar.com/2008/07/12/i_remember_how/">Tempest 2000, 3000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_4000">4000</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TxK">TxK</a>,</em> <em>the iOS <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2011/01/06/jeff-minters-minotaur-rescue-charges-into-the-app-store/">Minotaur Project</a></em>; and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(2017_video_game)">Polybius</a></em>. Additionally, he has long been one of this writers’ true industry heroes. </p>



<figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/2020/11/26/jeff-minter-names-no-mans-sky-as-his-game-of-a-generation/pfmgnzt/"><img loading="lazy" width="1970" height="1642" src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt.jpg" alt="Jeff Minter explains why No Man's Sky is his game of a generation." srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt.jpg 1970w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt-300x250.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt-1024x854.jpg 1024w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt-768x640.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt-1536x1280.jpg 1536w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pFmGnzt-324x270.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 1970px) 100vw, 1970px"></a></figure>



<p>Soon after the launch of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> back in 2016, Minter began tweeting his enjoyment exploring the wild and alien, procedurally generated worlds that Hello Games had brought into being. <a href="http://minotaurproject.co.uk/blog/?p=380">A post on his blog</a> from September 2106 (don’t let the title fool you) expresses the degree to which the game had impressed him. (His post was included in a list of articles reacting to <em>No Man’s Sky</em> on the first post made from <em>this</em> blog, <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2016/09/01/a-few-words-about-the-best-game-ive-ever-played-no-mans-sky/">“A Few Words About the Best Game I’ve Ever Played: ‘No Man’s Sky’”</a>, on September 1, 2016.) </p>



<p>A brief excerpt from Minter’s assessment of No Man’s Sky (shown in full, above), follows. </p>



<blockquote><p>Regarding a ‘game of the generation’, I think for me it’d have to be No Man’s Sky. Even back at the very start when there wasn’t a great deal of complex gameplay in it (and the developers were taking a right kicking for that), nonetheless I thought the style was fantastic (recreating almost perfectly the style of 1970s sci-fi book covers) and remarkably creating an explorable universe in that style was quite an amazing achievement. …</p></blockquote>



<p>This nod from industry veteran Jeff Minter is mighty kudos, indeed, for Hello Games and the universe they have created with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. And, thinking about it, this seems a rather apt post to have put together on Thanksgiving Day!</p>

<h2>LTE Tools</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a collection of open source software (OSS) tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832 based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8 bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 PPM. In fact, since the LTE downlink center frequencies are accurate to within 0.050 PPM, these tools can be used to calibrate the receiver's oscillator.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools/78-default-category/77-lte-cell-scanner">LTE Cell Scanner</a>&nbsp;is a tool that will scan a set of frequencies and identify LTE carriers. It also decodes the MIB.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools/78-default-category/78-lte-tracker">LTE Tracker</a> is a realtime tool that continuously identifies and tracks all the LTE cells on a particular frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code was developed on an Ubuntu 12.04 system but has also been <a href="http://superkuh.com/rtlsdr.html#ltescanner" target="_blank">made to work on Ubuntu 10.04</a>.</p>

<p>Every day I go for a 45-minute walk first thing in the morning. I’ve been doing it for almost two months now, I think. And it has become one of the most essential parts of my daily routine.</p>



<p>Walking awakens my mind and my body. It makes me feel energized, sharp and clear-headed. It helps me disentangle my thoughts, digest experiences and see unfamiliar patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe that’s why it’s so easy for me to write while I walk. Why it comes so naturally. I hate to admit it, but for some reason I struggle to write standing still. I need cadence. I need movement.</p>



<p>When I walk, my mind and my body move together. They ride and go along in unison, creating a feeling of immense tranquillity and equilibrium. Even when I’m witnessing dark or conflicting thoughts, it all flows smoothly.</p>



<p>I’ve always like walking. And I think I’ve also known for a while how much it helps me. Despite that, though, it was never a consistent habit. It was always occasional.</p>



<p>But now I seriously doubt I could go on with my life without doing it every day. I would go mad. Especially now that I call myself a creator.</p>



<p>Walking has become not just indispensable to my work and productivity, but also to my happiness and well-being — it is a form of self-care, even therapy.</p>

<p>As I write this, British Columbia and many parts of the world are entering another lockdown to curb the second wave of COVID 19. We’ve found ourselves with an abnormal amount of free time, but how many of us have actually used that time to make the changes we said we were going to at the start of January 2020. I spent the last couple of years trying to find the app I want to use to manage my thoughts and reflection. I (un)fortunately came to the conclusion to build my own and am happy to introduce <a href="https://engram.xyzdigital.com/">Engram – an open source knowledge management tool</a>.</p>

<p>Most years I make it to about February before I lose track of my New Years’ Resolution. This year I set the goal to check in with myself on a weekly basis. Somewhat unintentionally, I found myself setting a new resolution each week. One week I realized how tired I was, so I shifted my bedtime earlier. Another week I challenged myself to finish a whole book (something that would previously take me months to accomplish).</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Despite losing at least two weeks <a href="https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/two-weeks-of-covid">recovering from COVID</a> and everything going on around the world, I am on track for one of my favorite years. Checking in with myself has helped me find the things I really want to be doing. Every time I accomplish one of those weekly goals I get a boost of confidence.  Even when I don’t meet my goals I usually make it much farther than I would have without them.</p>

<p>When I was still in school, I was an avid note taker. On the personal side of things, I kept a shared journal with people that I dated.  I didn’t comprehend why writing things down would be useful for just myself, so having someone to share it with was good motivation. In the classroom, I started a new page of notes for each class every day. Like most other students, I was excited to make it to the end of the year and take my notebook to throw out all my hard work.</p>

<p>Each year the same thing repeated. I did well enough that I assumed my strategies were working.  It wasn’t until university that I realized the importance of re-reviewing notes after writing them.  Many times I wrote out some math or code, understanding none of it. After I slept that night and took another look, I was usually able to make better sense of it.</p>

<p>2018 started with a very similar resolution: “figure out what I want to do with my life”. I had just left a job after completely burning myself out. A knee injury from two years earlier had developed in to severe chronic pain – making it difficult to sit for more than 20 minutes at a time. Something wasn’t right and I needed to find an answer.</p>

<p>I took the next three months off. This is when I started journaling more consistently. Each day was a new opportunity to try something different and see how it made me feel. When I reached the end of the day I would reflect on what I did and how it made me feel. By the end of the second month, I felt my soul returning to my body. I rediscovered my passion for all forms of software development and this is a realization I plan to stick to.</p>

<p>I’ve written about the <a href="https://adam.xyzdigital.com/tech/software/spring-cleaning">digital mess I got myself into</a> trying to move my knowledge management process to the cloud. I’ve tried what feels like every app with the word “Note” in it. Each one has some quirk that gets in the way of my creativity.</p>

<p>I sat down – actually <a href="https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/breadth-first-search-a-walk-in-the-park-chapter-one">went for a walk</a> - to ponder what the absolute minimum viable product would be.  I landed on an app that allows you to quickly enter thoughts without any friction along the way. With just the click of the icon, you are immediately ready to enter a new note.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/pivIRHQWpk">pic.twitter.com/pivIRHQWpk</a></p>— Shower Thoughts (@TheWeirdWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWeirdWorld/status/677881012785844224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p>Like Twitter, but for your private thoughts</p>

<p>This doesn’t sound like much, but I’m already ~100 commits in on <a href="https://github.com/adamjberg/engram">Github</a> and have been actively developing it for just over month. This is the start of something much bigger.</p>

<p>Interested? Here’s what you can do to get involved:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> is a Chinese lunar sample return mission. It was launched a few days ago on 2020-11-23 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center">Wenchang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782149490413568">is estimated</a> to perform lunar orbit injection on Saturday. Since then, a number of Amateurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom/status/1331092113069543425">USA Satcom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom/status/1331317024992210944">Paul Marsh M0EYT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331138035891650560">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supertrack_it/status/1331354629146365953">Fer IW1DTU</a> and others have been receiving the X-band signals from the spacecraft and posting reports over on Twitter. Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>

<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png" alt="" width="644" height="640" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-300x298.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-768x763.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>

            <p>Five reasons why I think consistency is king:</p><ol><li><strong>Consistency leads to success.</strong> Consistency requires discipline. Discipline keeps me focused on those things that contribute to my goals.</li><li><strong>Being consistent helps me win trust.</strong> If I say something, I consistently follow through. If I commit to a timeline, I deliver. If I am attending a meeting, I show up on time. This consistent behaviour has won me respect and appreciation from peers, seniors, friends and family.</li><li><strong>Consistency helps me stand out for all the right reasons.</strong> Following small habits leads to remarkable outcomes. Delivering outcomes consistently sets me apart from others around me.</li><li><strong>Consistency enables measurement of success and failure.</strong> If I try something new, I do it for some time (typically six months) consistently. Without this trial period, there is no way to decide if it works or not.</li><li><strong>Consistency forces accountability.</strong></li></ol>

    <p>Oh boy, am I glad that I trusted my gut feeling.</p>

<p>You probably know the type of badge I’m talking about.  It’s tiny, lives in the lower-right corner of the screen and says something like “by Jakob Greenfeld”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/tinybadge.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But not too many indie makers seem to be using it. I hesitated myself. It makes the fact that the project is an indie project immediately obvious. Hence the project will be perceived as less professional. Also it possibly distracts customers and might annoy some of them.</p>

<p>So there are lots of reasons why you shouldn’t include a badge and not really many objective ones why you should.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to include one on all of my pages. The main reason was that I instantly like a page more if it has such a badge (and not some annoying chat widget or whatever.) It shows me directly that I’m a looking at a project by a fellow indie maker. I really think of the badge as some kind of membership card for the indie maker club.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of this. You’re probably not here to hear about my sentimental feelings.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to the main story.</p>

<p>Now what happened is that yesterday I’m getting lots of new followers even though I didn’t write a single tweet. Also I’m getting lots of Gumroad notifications.</p>

<p><em>“You have a new subscriber for <a href="https://gumspy.com/">Gum Spy</a>”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”….</em></p>

<p>Cool, but strange. Something must be happening but I have no idea what.</p>

<p>Then I get a DM from <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevMcKendrick">Trevor McKendrick</a> (Chief of Staff @ Lambda School).</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Apparently, Sam Parr and Shaan Puri talked about me on <a href="https://www.myfirstmillionpodcast.com/">their podcast</a>. The show has hundreds of thousands of listeners. I’m just a guy with 600 Twitter followers who launched his first paid product 4 weeks ago. This is insane.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/496MjbRwFPa52tqdJBvC3m?si=QrBc05p3TlOgEFDl9iqRNA">episode</a>, Shaan mentions that he discovered my stuff because of a tiny badge in the lower-right corner on the Gum Spy landing page.</p>

<p>Without the badge, my site would’ve been just another faceless project. But thanks to the badge, Shaan was quickly able to see that I’m a “build in public type of guy”, that I’m currently doing a <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/mba">Bootstrap MBA learning experiment</a>,  that I recently launched similar projects. And this is why he decided to give me a shoutout on the show.</p>

<p>You probably thought the title of this post is clickbait. It’s not.</p>

<p>I really made dozens of sales (still counting) and got hundreds of new <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://productideas.substack.com/">newsletter subscribers</a> only thanks to the tiny badge.</p>

<p>So what’s the takeaway? Use a “made by” badge on your sites, obviously.</p>

<p>And no worries, I’m not trying to sell you some “made by” badge service. The code for the badge I’m using is <a href="https://gist.github.com/levelsio/9c531122e557da6282458bbc2a8e2aff">freely available</a> (thanks <a href="https://levels.ui/">Pieter</a>!) and is so simple that really anyone can use it.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Compound API input and output formats are specified by&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Protocol Buffers</a>, known colloquially as protobufs. Unlike typical protobufs endpoints, the Compound endpoints support JSON for input and output in addition to the protobufs binary format. To use JSON in both the input and the output, specify the headers&nbsp;“Content-Type: application/json”and&nbsp;“Accept: application/json”in the request.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>API keys are currently optional, and are included in the HTTP header&nbsp;compound-api-key; you can request keys from Compound in the #development channel of our&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/874ntdw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Discord</a>&nbsp;server. In the future, API keys will be required to access the API.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Account API retrieves information for various accounts which have interacted with Compound. You can use this API to pull data about a specific account by address, or alternatively, pull data for a list of unhealthy accounts (that is, accounts which are approaching under-collateralization).</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#AccountService">https://compound.finance/developers/api#AccountService</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Use <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-utils.html#bn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">big numbers</a> to do computation. Convert to decimal when displaying in UX.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Exponential Math</strong></p><p>The Compound smart contracts use a system of exponential math in order to represent fractional quantities with sufficient precision. Throughout the documentation and code we make reference to mantissas, which are unsigned integers scaled up by a factor of 1e18 from their nominal value. By using mantissas within our contracts, we may perform basic mathematical operations like multiplication and division at a higher resolution than working with the unscaled quantities directly as integers. To gain a better understanding of how this works, see&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-money-market/blob/master/contracts/Exponential.sol" target="_blank">Exponential.sol</a>.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers#exponential-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers#exponential-math</a></cite></blockquote>



<h3>AccountRequest</h3>



<pre><code>{
  "addresses": [] // returns all accounts if empty or not included
  "block_number": 0 // returns latest if given 0
  "max_health": { "value": "10.0" } // Filter for accounts where outstanding borrows divided by collateral value
                                    // is less than the provided amount. If returned value is less than 1.0, for instance,
                                    // the account is subject to liquidation.

  "page_number": 1
  "page_size": 10
}</code></pre>



<h3>AccountResponse</h3>



<blockquote><p><code>close_factor</code>: The portion of an outstanding borrow that can be closed in a liquidation, which is a percentage of the total underlying borrow balance. For example if the close factor is 0.1, then an account in liqudation is liable to have 10% of its borrows liquidated.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><strong>Close Factor</strong>: The portion of a borrow in a single market that may be closed by a liquidator during a single liquidation. For example, if Joe borrows 100 ZRX and the close factor is 0.3, then a liquidator may close 30 ZRX. The close factor is globally defined across all markets.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers#glossary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers#glossary</a></cite></blockquote>



<h4>Close Factor</h4>



<p>The percent, ranging from 0% to 100%, of a liquidatable account’s borrow that can be repaid in a single liquidate transaction. If a user has multiple borrowed assets, the closeFactor applies to any single borrowed asset, not the aggregated value of a user’s outstanding borrowing.</p>



<h5>Comptroller</h5>



<pre><code>function closeFactorMantissa() view returns (uint)</code></pre>



<ul><li>RETURN&nbsp;:&nbsp;The closeFactor, scaled by 1e18, is multiplied by an outstanding borrow balance to determine how much could be closed.</li></ul>



<p>Can multiple transactions, each liquidating 0.3, be sent sequentially? For example, the first transaction liquidates 0.3, and the health is still &lt; 1.0. Can a second transaction liquidate another 0.3? Each liquidation also removes 1.05 collateral.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Counterproductive Incentives</strong><br>The protocol includes a mechanism to incentivize arbitrageurs to repay loans that are under-collateralized. This should increase the borrower’s liquidity, reducing the risk of insolvency. After all, that is the point of the mechanism. However, there is a threshold where the incentives reverse and the liquidation mechanism actually pushes borrowers towards insolvency.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-audit/</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><code>liquidation_incentive</code>: The amount of extra collateral that will be seized to incentivize liquidation. For example, an incentive of 1.05 implies that a liquidator will receive a 5% bonus on the exchange of collateral during a liquidation.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><strong>Liquidation Incentive</strong>: The additional collateral given to liquidators as an incentive to perform liquidation of underwater accounts. For example, if the liquidation incentive is 1.1, liquidators receive an extra 10% of the borrowers collateral for every unit they close. The liquidation incentive is globally defined across all markets.</p><cite><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://compound.finance/developers#glossary" target="_blank">https://compound.finance/developers#glossary</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><code>accounts</code>: The list of accounts (see Account below) matching the requested filter, with the associated account and cToken data.</p><cite><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<h4>Get Account Liquidity</h4>



<p>Within the Compound Protocol, account liquidity is defined as the total estimated ether value of an account’s collateral (supply balances multiplied by the protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#collateral-factor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">collateral factor</a>, minus the total value of that account’s borrow balances. These values are calculated using only the markets which the account has&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#enter-markets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">entered</a>&nbsp;into.</p>



<p>Users who do not have positive account liquidity do not have the ability to withdraw or borrow any assets until they bring their account liquidity back positive by supplying more assets or paying back outstanding borrows.</p>



<p>Sometimes account liquidity refers to a single signed value, rather than two unsigned values – however the Compound Protocol only deals with unsigned integers. A negative value for account liquidity also means the user is subject to liquidation to bring their account liquidity back to zero.</p>



<h5>Comptroller</h5>



<pre><code>function getAccountLiquidity(address account) view returns (uint, uint, uint)</code></pre>



<ul><li>account&nbsp;:&nbsp;The account whose liquidity shall be calculated.</li><li>RETURN&nbsp;:&nbsp;Tuple of values (error, liquidity, shortfall). The error shall be 0 on success, otherwise an&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#comptroller-error-codes">error code</a>. A non-zero liquidity value indicates the account has available&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#account-liquidity">account liquidity</a>. A non-zero shortfall value indicates the account is currently below his/her&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers#collateral">collateral requirement</a>&nbsp;and is subject to liquidation. At most one of liquidity or shortfall shall be non-zero.</li></ul>

<p>As you can see there are many machine learning specific attacks, but also a lot of “typical” red teaming techniques that put AI/ML systems at risk.

<p>Hope the content is helpful and maybe even inspiring for others to start building, breaking and better protecting AI/ML systems.</p>

University</a>.</i></p><h2><b>Biomedical advances</b></h2><p>While low-frequency cavitation can often destroy molecules and cells, they remain mostly intact under the high-frequency sound waves.</p><p>This makes them gentle enough to use in biomedical devices to manipulate biomolecules and cells without affecting their integrity – the basis for the various drug delivery technologies patented by the RMIT research team.</p><p>One of these patented devices is a cheap, lightweight and portable advanced nebuliser that can precisely deliver large molecules such as DNA and antibodies, unlike existing nebulisers.</p><p>This opens the potential for painless, needle-free vaccinations and treatments.</p><p>The nebuliser uses high-frequency sound waves to excite the surface of the fluid or drug, generating a fine mist that can deliver larger biological molecules directly to the lungs.</p><p>The nebuliser technology can also be used to encapsulate a drug in protective polymer nanoparticles, in a one-step process bringing together nano-manufacturing and drug delivery.</p><p>In addition, the researchers have shown irradiating cells with the high-frequency sound waves allows therapeutic molecules to be inserted into the cells without damage, a technique that can be used in emerging cell-based therapies.</p><h2><b>Smart materials</b></h2><p>The team has used the sound waves to drive crystallisation for the sustainable production of metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs.</p><p>Predicted to be the defining material of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, MOFs are ideal for sensing and trapping substances at minute concentrations, to purify water or air, and can also hold large amounts of energy, for making better batteries and energy storage devices.</p><p>While the conventional process for making a MOF can take hours or days and requires the use of harsh solvents or intensive energy processes, the RMIT team has developed a clean, sound wave-driven technique that can produce a customised MOF in minutes and can be easily scaled up for efficient mass production.</p><p>Sound waves can also be used for nano-manufacturing 2D materials, which are used in myriad applications from flexible electric circuits to solar cells.</p><h2><b>Scaling up and pushing boundaries</b></h2><p>The next steps for the RMIT team are focused on scaling up the technology.</p><p>At a low cost of just $US0.70 per device, the sound wave-generating microchips can be produced using the standard processes for mass fabrication of silicon chips for computers.</p><p>“This opens the possibility of producing industrial quantities of materials with these sound waves through massive parallelisation – using thousands of our chips simultaneously,” Yeo said.</p><p>The team at the Micro/Nanophysics Research Laboratory, in RMIT’s <a

<p>A friend once advised me to write down all that he explained to me whenever I came to him for clarification on a topic, because even though I would understand all that he taught me, not writing those things down because I had understood them always made me come back to him for the same solution over and over and over again. Blogging about what I just learned or had learned in the past showed me the relevance of his advice.</p>
<p>I have found certain points to be responsible for <a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/writer-s-block">writer's block</a> </p>
<h2>Vagueness of a topic</h2>
<p>Not knowing much or anything about a topic definitely leads to writer's block. The solution to this is seeking clarity about the topic(read it up or discuss it).</p>
<h2>Fear of the topic not being good enough</h2>
<p>This happened to me last night when I was writing on <a target="_blank" href="https://afy.afomaorji.com/basic-javascript-golf-code">Golf Code</a>. The solution to this is knowing that the article is firstly for you. When I applied this solution by reminding myself that I wouldn't want to start cracking my head for an explanation to some topics, I damned the consequences, and guess what? When I started writing on it, the more I wrote, the more I had more ideas to write on 😉. In the end, did it help others? Yes it did 😊.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">about creating a lisp interpreter in Python</a>. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.</p><p>Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, <em>what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?</em></p><p><strong>Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born.</strong> In this essay you and I will follow along with <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">Norvig’s Lispy</a>, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of lisp, some Paul Graham’s essays (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html" target="_blank">one</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html" target="_blank">two</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">three</a>), alongside some <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a> will get you fired up. In short, everything is a list, everything is an expression, and that makes for a very powerful language.</p><p>Our structure will be similar to Norvig’s tutorial, though I depart slightly in two ways:</p><ol><li>Instead of 2 stopping points (Lispy Calculator and Full Lispy), we have 4 stopping points. This reflects the phases I took to build it in Rust.</li><li>Norvig’s syntax is based on Scheme. We will base it on Scheme too, but since I’m also a Clojure fan, I sometimes used slightly different naming, and different implementations for a few functions. I will note when I do that in the essay.</li></ol><p>Finally, this is the first program I wrote in Rust. I may have misused some things, so if you’re a Rust hacker, I’d love to hear your feedback 🙂.</p><p>With the notes out of the way, let’s get into it.</p><p>As Norvig suggests, our first goal is to create a subset of lisp, that can do what a basic calculator can do.</p><p>To make it as simple as possible to follow, for language 1, <strong>we’ll <em>only</em> support addition and subtraction.</strong> No variable definitions, no if statements, nada.</p><p>This departs a bit from Lispy, but I found this stopping point a lot more convenient when writing it in Rust. So, our goal:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>//=&gt; 17</span>
<span>(</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; 3</span></code></pre><p>The important process we need to remember is the flow of an interpreter:</p><p><em>our program</em> ⟶ <em><strong>parse</strong></em> ⟶ <em>abstract syntax tree</em> ⟶ <em><strong>eval</strong></em> ⟶ <em>result</em></p><p>We will need to <strong>parse</strong> our program and convert it into an abstract syntax tree. After that, we can <strong>eval</strong> the abstract syntax tree and get our result. (Refer to Norvig’s article for more detailed definitions and explanations).</p><h2 id="type-definitions">Type Definitions</h2><p>Risp can have three kinds of values for now:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispExp</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>List</span><span>(</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>),</span>
<span>} </span></code></pre><p>We’ll also need an error type. We’ll keep this simple, but if you’re curious there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19812159" target="_blank">more robust approach</a>.</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispErr</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Reason</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Finally, we’ll need an <em>environment</em> type. This is where we will store defined variables, built-in functions, and so forth:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>struct</span><span> </span><span>RispEnv</span><span> {</span>
<span>  data: HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>, RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2><p>Our goal is to take our program, and build an abstract syntax tree from it. For us, that is going to be a <code>RispExp</code>. To do this, first we will take our program, and cut it up into a bunch of tokens:</p><pre><code><span>tokenize(</span><span>"(+ 10 5)"</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; ["(", "+", "10", "5", ")"]</span></code></pre><p>Here’s how we can do that in Rust:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>tokenize</span><span>(expr: </span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  expr</span>
<span>    .</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"("</span><span>, </span><span>" ( "</span><span>)</span>

<span>    .</span><span>split_whitespace</span><span>()</span>
<span>    .</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span><span> x.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())</span>
<span>    .</span><span>collect</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can parse these tokens, into a <code>RispExp</code>:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;(tokens: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(RispExp, &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]), RispErr&gt; {</span>
<span>  </span><span>let</span><span> (token, rest) </span><span>=</span><span> tokens.</span><span>split_first</span><span>()</span>

<span>  }</span>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"wait"</span>);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (ioctl(fildes[<span>1</span>], FIONSPACE, <span>&amp;</span>n) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	In the race to develop and produce a COVID-19 vaccine, Canada is on the sidelines despite its once notable status as a global source for life-saving injections.</p>
<p>
	Canada lost that standing long ago, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained this week, which means even if the country had developed its own novel coronavirus vaccine, there would be no means to produce it on the scale required.</p>
<p>
	â€œWe used to have [production capacity] decades ago but we no longer have it,â€� Trudeau said <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pm-touts-deal-for-26k-doses-of-covid-19-therapeutic-seeks-to-temper-vaccine-expectations-1.5202350" target="_blank">Tuesday in Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>
	How did it get to this point? Canadian administrations simply took their â€œeye off the ball,â€� said Earl Brown, an infectious disease expert and a former member of the H1N1 vaccine task group in Canada. After that pandemic, a review found that vaccine production capacity was â€œright at the topâ€� of the list of problems, he said. It wasnâ€™t always that way.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><em><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	â€œWe had great vaccine producers in Canada -- world leaders essentially -- 50 years ago,â€� he told CTVâ€™s Your Morning on Wednesday. There was Connaught Laboratories in Toronto, which was known for producing insulin to treat diabetes and inoculants for diphtheria and polio, and Institut Armand Frappier in Montreal that produced vaccines, including one for tuberculosis, he noted.</p>
<p>
	â€œThe problem was they had a poor business model,â€� said Brown. â€œThese were vaccine companies spun off from universities, so there was indirect funding and they had a model of not making so much profit.â€�</p>
<p>
	So they were eventually sold, Montreal's Frappier lab to British multinational GlaxoSmithKline and Connaught, through a series of mergers, to French multinational Sanofi Pasteurâ€‹ after Brian Mulroneyâ€™s Progressive Conservative government's program of privatizationâ€‹. The labs now have a â€œtighter production line and not so much capacity,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	The inability to mount a domestic production campaign means that the Canadian government must rely on purchase agreements with top U.S. and European pharmaceutical brands, including <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/a-long-way-from-lab-bench-to-bedside-virus-experts-urge-covid-19-vaccine-caution-1.5199238" target="_blank">Pfizer, Moderna</a> and <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shown-to-be-effective-and-cheaper-1.5200355" target="_blank">AstraZeneca</a>, to produce and provide the shots to Canadians once the vaccines are approved by Health Canada. In the absence of a domestic candidate, Ottawa has ordered as many as 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates from seven different companies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>'A MAJOR GLITCH'</strong></p>
<p>
	There are some promising vaccine candidates in development across Canada, including Quebecâ€™s Medicago and Saskatchewanâ€™s VIDO-InterVac, but the companies lack the means to produce them here. What would that mean for rollout should those candidates be successful?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThatâ€™s a major glitch,â€� said Brown. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to get a partner, somebody whoâ€™s got the ability to do that and then you have to get them onside, tuned up, send them your vaccine, get it produced and bottled. Not the best way to do it.â€�</p>
<p>
	For those Canadian companies to mount production campaigns on their own will take time -- and a lot of it, they have said. VIDO-InterVac said it has plans to build a facility in one year, but that it would take another still to get it in operating shape. â€œThatâ€™s not the time frame you like,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, Canadians will have to rely on speedier countries with approved COVID-19 vaccines to provide doses, but Canadians won't be prioritized ahead of their own people. â€œCountries like the United States, Germany and the U.K. do have domestic pharmaceutical facilities, which is why theyâ€™re obviously going to prioritize helping their citizens first,â€� Trudeau said on Tuesday in Ottawa.</p>
<p>
	To help Canadians first, the federal government should set up a Crown corporation to produce vaccines, suggests Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus with York Universityâ€™s School of Health Policy and Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œItâ€™s one thing if we give up the ability to domestically make something like laundry detergent. We can all live without laundry detergent. But when it comes to medications and vaccines, those are critical for the health of Canadians and we should be able to make them ourselves,â€� he told CTV National News. â€œNot only will the ability to domestically produce them ensure that Canadians get the care that they need, but we can also fulfill our human rights obligations by exporting them at low cost to low- and middle-income countries.â€�</p>
<p>
	<strong>'GROSS INCOMPETENCE'</strong></p>
<p>
	The reliance on other countries and private companies is upsetting critics of Trudeau, who said Tuesday that his administration has begun funding domestic vaccine production capacity because â€œwe never want to be caught short again.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThis is gross incompetence thatâ€™s going to cost Canadians their lives and their jobs,â€� said Conservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner on Tuesday from Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>
	But criticism toward one governmentâ€™s inaction may often easily be directed at another with hindsight, countered Brown on Your Morning.</p>
<p>
	â€œWhen you have the problem, you look back and say â€˜We should have done something, shouldnâ€™t we?â€™â€� he said.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1684">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p><a href="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="285"></a></p>
<p>In the 1600s, the world’s first stock exchange was established in Amsterdam. In 1688, a trader by the name of Josef de la Vega wrote “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Confusion-Confusiones-Portions-Descriptive-Amsterdam/dp/1614274517/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1536921443&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=confusion+de+confusiones">Confusion Of Confusions</a>” – the world’s oldest surviving account of trading stocks. The book is an amazing record of the business. Yet despite being written over 300 years ago, it sounds eerily familiar to our markets today.<span id="more-1684"></span></p>
<p><strong>Addiction</strong></p>
<p>First off, De la Vega has no illusions about the dark side of the industry. He describes the Dutch stock market as “the fairest and most deceitful in Europe…the finest and the most vulgar on earth.” He laments that “this business has been converted into a game, and merchants [concerned in it] have become speculators.” And “what is worse, a portion of the stock brokers have become card-sharpers [hustlers, exploiters]”. Yet, “it is great error to assume that you can withdraw [temporarily] from the Exchange or that you can gain peace of mind when you cease to meet with the other speculators…He who entered the circle of the Exchange is in eternal agitation and sits in a prison, the key of which lies in the ocean and the bars of which never open.”</p>
<p><strong>4 Principles</strong></p>
<p>With this backdrop, he writes about “some precepts” that he lives by:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares” since the “most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly”</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Take every gain without showing remorse about missed profits, because an eel may escape sooner than you think”. Put another way, “it is wise to enjoy that which is possible without hoping for …the persistence of luck.”</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins. At one time they may be carbuncle stones [gemstones], then coals, then diamonds, then flint-stones, then morning dew, then tears”. I guess he means investment gains are not permanent.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whoever wishes to win this game must have patience and money, since the values are so little constant and the rumours so little founded on truth. He who knows how to endure blows without being terrified by the misfortune resembles the lion who answers the thunder with a roar, and is unlike the hind [deer] who, stunned by the thunder, tries to flee.”</p>
<p><strong>The Mind Of a Trader</strong></p>
<p>He has a keen eye on the psychology of the traders. Speculators “are very clever in inventing reasons for a rise in the price of shares on occasions when there is a declining tendency.” And “when speculators talk, they talk shares…when they look at something, it is shares that they see…But what surpasses these enormities…is the fact that the speculator…struggles against his own will …and is at odds with his own decisions…If, for example, there arrives a piece of news which would induce the speculator to buy, while the atmosphere prevailing at the stock exchange forces him to sell, his reasoning fights his own good reasons…”</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about price formation: “the expectation of an event creates a much deeper impression upon the exchange than the event itself. When large dividends or rich imports are expected, shares will rise in price; but if the expectation becomes a reality, the shares often fall; for the joy over the favourable development and the jubilation over lucky chance have abated in the meantime.”</p>
<p><strong>Bulls and Bears</strong></p>
<p>He splits traders into two classes. “The first class consists of the bulls. They start their operations by purchases…They always desire a rise in the price of the shares; they hope that by reason of good news the market will be suddenly stirred up, and that prices will rise high rapidly. The second faction consists of the bears…The bears always begin operations by sales…These bears must be fled like the plague, and one must take their part only on extraordinary occasions”</p>
<p>More colourfully, he describes them as follows:</p>
<p>“The bulls are like the giraffe which is scared of noting…They love everything, they praise everything, they exaggerate everything…the bulls make the public believe that their tricks signify wealth and that crops grow on graves…The bears on the contrary, are completely ruled by fear, trepidation and nervousness. Rabbits become elephants, brawls in a tavern become rebellions, faint shadows appear to them as signs of chaos.”</p>
<p><strong>Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it was remarkable how sophisticated the instruments available to trade were: they could trade cash markets, forwards and even options:</p>
<p>[On managing downside]: “The Dutch call the option business “opsies” a term derived from the Latin word “optio”, which means choice, because the payer of the premium has the of delivering the shares…Give “opsies” or premiums, and there will only be limited risk to you, while the gain may surpass all your imaginings…it is impossible to lose&nbsp; more than the price of the premium</p>
<p>So, looks like nothing much has changed!</p>
<p>Bilal</p>

        <h2>Everything Old is New Again</h2>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets are old newsâ€” According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bookmarklets have been around since the year 2000</a>.
          The usefulness and popularity of bookmarklets has certainly waned
          in the last 20 years as browser extensions have grown in popularity. However, you can still create bookmarklets and
          unlike modern browser extensions, bookmarklets work on all major web browsers (even on mobile).
        </p>

        <p>
          I maintain a few products that rely on browser extensions to provide convenient product functionality.
          When it comes to your product and business, Google's web store is
          <a href="https://medium.com/@miko_89964/after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why-83a3f8d65cbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risky to say the least</a>.
          I have been experimenting with the idea of offering a bookmarklet in addition to my product's browser
          extension. At the very least, I would like to offer a bookmarklet as an extension fallback in the event
          things ever go south with Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately (or, <i>fortunately</i> depending on how you look at it) bookmarklets have been
          stripped of some useful functionality. Due to security concerns most websites place content policies
          on their webpages. These policies limit which resources and domains can be used within the context
          of the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of the content policies bookmarklets face a few restrictions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You can no longer rely on loading styles, html or javascript from a remote server.</li>
          <li>You are restricted by the amount of data and code you can fit in a single URL (which is roughly 2,000 characters).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You are probably thinking bookmarklets are useless with such restrictions. However, there are quite a few
          upsides to bookmarklets.
        </p>

        <h2>Restricted but not useless.</h2>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets may not share the same level of control and freedom browser extensions have, but they do offer a number of
          upsides browser extensions are unable to provide. Here are a few upsides to consider:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You don't need to rely on a third party web store for distribution.
          </li>
          <li>The same bookmarklet code works everywhere; even on mobile browsers.</li>
          <li>
            No automatic updates. I prefer this over the extension model of automatic updates. In the
            extension world you never know what code is running in your browser at any given point in time. If
            an extension is hijacked or sold to a malicious third party you could be running malicious code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bookmarklets can skirt by a strict IT department. Believe it or not, I have enterprise customers that
            are unable to use my product's extension because their IT department forbids browser extensions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets are far from perfect and may not be ideal for your specific needs.
          There are two patterns I commonly see where bookmarklets remain as viable alternatives to browser
          extensions. The two common patterns I see can be summarized in the following ways:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You want to modify the target page in some way.
          </li>

          <li>
            You want to extract data and present it locally or transfer the data to another service.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I will demonstrate both of the patterns above with a few bookmarklets I created for this blog post.
          The complete source code for all of the demonstrated bookmarklets can be found on <a href="https://prophitt.me/src">my source code page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a preview of the four bookmarklets:</p>

          </p></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Pattern 1: Modifying Pages (Div Highlighter)</h2>

        <p>
          Note, all demoed bookmarklets can be "installed" by dragging and dropping their respective heading link into your bookmark tool
          bar. You can also manually create a bookmarklet by copying and pasting the provided location string into the location
          field of a new bookmark.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest of all use cases for a bookmarklet is to make a temporary modification to a web page. For example,
          removing an auth wall, changing a page from "light" mode to "dark" mode, etc. To demonstrate how to accomplish this
          functionality with a bookmarklet, I took a Chrome browser extension and converted it into a bookmarklet with identical
          functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          After some digging around I found the <a href="https://github.com/itsHobbes/div-highlighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">div-highlighter</a>
          extension by <a href="https://github.com/itsHobbes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itsHobbes</a>. When clicked the extension highlights all divs
          on the current page with a random border and background color. This is a common debugging technique and the extension is a
          great example for this pattern. I took the code from the extension and wrapped it inside of a function to
          prevent polluting the global namespace.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var MIN_PARENT_COUNT = 0;
  var MAX_PARENT_COUNT = 3;

  function rgba() {
      var o = Math.round, r = Math.random, s = 255;
      return 'rgba(' + o(r() * s) + ',' + o(r() * s) + ',' + o(r() * s) + ',' + 0.4 + ')';
  }

  var divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');

  for (var i = 0; i &lt; divs.length; i++) {
      if (divs[i].offsetHeight == 0 || divs[i].offsetWidth == 0) {
          continue;
      }

      var parents = 0;
      var node = divs[i];

      while (node != null) {
          if (node.tagName == 'DIV') {
              parents++;
          }

          node = node.parentNode;
      }

      if (parents &gt;= MIN_PARENT_COUNT &amp;&amp; parents &lt;= MAX_PARENT_COUNT) {
          var color = rgba();

          divs[i].style.boxSizing = 'border-box';
          divs[i].style.border = '2px solid ' + color;
          divs[i].style.backgroundColor = color;
      }
  }
})();
</code></pre>

        <p>The minified location string is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>javascript:(function(){var MIN_PARENT_COUNT=0;var MAX_PARENT_COUNT=3;function rgba(){var o=Math.round,r=Math.random,s=255;return"rgba("+o(r()*s)+","+o(r()*s)+","+o(r()*s)+","+.4+")"}var divs=document.getElementsByTagName("div");for(var i=0;i&lt;divs.length;i++){if(divs[i].offsetHeight==0||divs[i].offsetWidth==0){continue}var parents=0;var node=divs[i];while(node!=null){if(node.tagName=="DIV"){parents++}node=node.parentNode}if(parents&gt;=MIN_PARENT_COUNT&amp;&amp;parents&lt;=MAX_PARENT_COUNT){var color=rgba();divs[i].style.boxSizing="border-box";divs[i].style.border="2px solid "+color;divs[i].style.backgroundColor=color}}})();
</code></pre>

        <p>
          You may notice the code for itsHobbes' extension and the bookmarklet are identical. Bookmarklets and extension content scripts
          work in essentially the same way.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Remote Data Extraction (Wayback Machine)</h2>

        <p>
          Another commonly seen pattern involves the extraction of some data from the page and the transfer of the data to another
          remote location. This pattern is often used to "share a post", "post a message", etc. For example, the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News bookmarklet</a>
          uses this pattern.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate this pattern I created a simple bookmarklet that will determine the hostname and protocol for the current web page and open the page up within Wayback Machine's
          archive. Essentially, we are extracting the url and transferring it to Wayback Machine in a new browser tab.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var host = location.protocol + "//" + location.hostname;
  window.open("https://web.archive.org/web/*/" + host, "_blank", "noreferrer,noopener");
})()
</code></pre>

        <p>The minified location string is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>javascript:(function(){var host=location.protocol+"//"+location.hostname;window.open("https://web.archive.org/web/*/"+host,"_blank","noreferrer,noopener")})();
</code></pre>

        <p>
          The demonstration above only extracted the protocol and host address from the web page but you can extract any information
          from the page. The only limitation is how much data you can safely fit in a url.
        </p>

        <p>
          The general consensus is you should limit url length to 2,000 characters or less for maximum browser support. I have tested
          Chrome and Firefox with very large urls (over 40,000 characters) and both worked as intended. However, it is probably a good
          idea to go with the general consensus unless you have a good reason not to.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Local Data Extraction (LinkedIn Search Result Scraper)</h2>

        <p>
          The data extraction example above extracted simple information from a web page and transferred it to another domain via a new tab.
          Another common variation of the pattern involves locally downloading data instead of transferring the data to a new location.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate this I created a bookmarklet that scrapes leads from a LinkedIn search results page and downloads the leads in a CSV file
          for local processing.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var links = document.querySelectorAll('a[data-control-name="search_srp_result"]');

  if (links.length === 0) return;

  function escape(s) {
    return '"' +  s.replace('"', '""') + '"';
  }

  function download(data) {
    var blob = new Blob([data], {type: 'text/csv'}),
        e    = document.createEvent('MouseEvents'),
        a    = document.createElement('a')

    a.download = 'data.csv';
    a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    a.dataset.downloadurl =  ['text/csv', …</code></pre></article></div>

<p>We use software for our everyday needs because we want to get something done. We have goals to achieve and things to do.</p>
<p>The software we use is coded by brave programmers that have their own goals. Most of the time there is an overlap between their goals and ours.</p>
<p>Over time these will diverge.</p>
<p>This means that the tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand. There will be bugs in these code parts which will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>
<p>So we are at a fork in the road:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it.</li>
<li>We have the choice of trying another program, whose creator's goals are closer to ours.</li>
<li>We also have the choice of coding the software ourself.</li></ul>
<p>All but the last path mean endless seeking, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. Therefore we replace programs we do not understand fully with our own implementation.</p>
<p>The followers of the Code It Yourself Manifesto believe in these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
<li>We learn how our tools we depend on need to work.</li>
<li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li></ul>
<p>We still embrace sharing of ideas and code.</p>
<p>Sharing is only possible if we are excellent developers to each other. The next developer reading our code will be us in a not so distant future. Coding It Ourselves means we will document our code, clearly stating the goal of the software we write.</p>
<p>Together we enjoy the diversity of implementations and ideas.</p>
<p>We encourage our colleagues to</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27316166-the-effective-manager">The Effective Manager</a> says you only need 5 to 15 seconds to deliver effective feedback. Here are the 4 steps:</p>



<ol><li>Ask (“Can I give you some feedback?”)</li><li>State the behavior (“When you X…”)</li><li>State the impact (“…the result is Y.”)</li><li>Encourage effective future behavior (“Keep it up!” for positive feedback or “Can you change that?” for negative feedback)</li></ol>



<p>Those steps should be followed whether you’re giving positive or negative feedback. </p>



<p>Here’s an example, pasted from the book:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Manager</strong>: Can I give you some feedback?<br><strong>Direct</strong>: Sure, boss.<br><strong>Manager</strong>: When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?</p></blockquote>



<p>Boom, done in seconds. (And if you’re thinking “but it’ll take much longer when you account for the inevitable debate about what actually happened!” then there’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">an answer for that too</a>.)</p>



<p>The beautiful thing about this rapid feedback is the frequency that it allows. When it only takes a few seconds, why not give feedback every day? Why not 5 times a day? It lowers the threshold of what is worthy of feedback.</p>



<p>One caveat: the book has a 3 question test you have to ask yourself before you can deliver the feedback:</p>



<ol><li>Are you angry? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you focused on the past instead of the future (i.e., reminding them about something they did wrong or punishing them)? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you able to let it go? If not, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>. In other words, if you can’t let it go in terms of how you feel, you <em>should</em> let it go by not giving negative feedback. If you feel an urge to deliver feedback, you’re probably doing it for the wrong reasons.</li></ol>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not angry, if it’s not about the past or about punishment, and if you can let it go, then go ahead and give the feedback.</p></blockquote>



<p>There you have it. 5 second feedback. Lower the threshold for what’s feedback-worthy and delivery a steady stream of rapid feedback every day.</p>

Damn Small Linux on a Libretto 50CT
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202011241930.05# -->
<p>November 24, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa
</p>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>In about 2004 a friend from college got into his hands a series of
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">Toshiba Libretto 50CT</a>.
They all came with Windows 95 pre installed, and we wiped them out
and installed Debian with a 2.2 kernel from floppies, with much pain because of
the unsupported disk drive. I remember it being so difficult that I
don't even want to write about it. But it booted and was able to
run Vim, Links, and connect to the internet. Enough for a
network-enabled typewriter.</p>

<p>I got Richard Stallman to sign mine while it was running GNU/Linux,
but when I bought a regular laptop I stopped using it because,
well, it is too old, and its keyboard is too tiny to type
comfortably with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto, closed" title=""></a></p>

<p>The Libretto, closed. It is a tiny machine, a wonderful piece of
engineering.</p>

<p>Around 2012 I found it inside a box at home, working
perfectly, with a battery life of a bit less than an hour—which is incredible for
a 12+ year old machine— and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS">DR-DOS</a> installed. I can't
remember why I did that, but
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe">Golden Axe</a> was also
installed, so there's a hint.</p>

<p>I decided to install a modern Linux and, at least, store it on a
working condition to give some justice to Stallman's signature.</p>

<p>There are some tutorials available on the net, but none of them
covered 100% of the hardware support for my machine. Most of them
are also outdated, and refer to distributions that don't exist,
don't have any support or are about unusable nowadays. However, I
took many hints from those tutorials, and I will reference them
accordingly.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>This laptop has a 75 MHz —actually, mine reports 74 MHz— with
<strong>24</strong> MB of RAM, which is an upgrade from the original 16 MB which
are usually bundled. The screen is 640x480, and if you choose a
higher resolution, instead of scaling the image, it only displays
the upper-leftmost 640x480 pixels, leaving the bottom and rightmost
part of the area out of sight.</p>

<p>The mouse device is emulated as a PS/2, and physically is a
"clitoris"-like pointing device. You know what I mean. 
Working with the X windows is a pain in the neck because the
location of the mouse and buttons isn't very ergonomic, and clicking on a button makes
the whole screen move on its hinges. </p>

<p>Next to the mouse there is a
speaker which is similar in quality to those of a modern
smartphone.</p>

<p>This device doesn't have any extension port other than a dock
connector for a dock I don't have, and a 16-bit PCMCIA slot, which
you will need for the network card. It doesn't have a COM port or
anything like that, which is understandable, given the size of the
case.</p>

<p>It does have an Infrared device, which is quite slow and useless,
but for its time it was as good as wireless could get. The other
holes correspond to the power adapter and the reset button next to
the PCMCIA, big enough to be able to reset the laptop with a
regular pen.</p>

<p>For the full specifications, please refer to
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">the official leaflet</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto" title=""></a></p>

<p>The setup I will be using: the Libretto, and a 3Com 16-bit PCMCIA
Ethernet card</p>

<h4>Choosing a Linux distribution</h4>

<p>I wanted to find some modern, low-demanding software, not
unsupported versions of Debian or RedHat. As you might have
expected by this page's title, I chose
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> (DSL).</p>

<p>I was very lucky to find that my machine had been upgraded to 24 MB
of RAM. Apparently, even low-end distros have difficulties booting
a regular kernel with 16 MB. I didn't want to tune or recompile the
kernel on a 75-MHz machine, so I had to do some tricks.</p>

<p>In order to decide on a distro, I tried to set some goals up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discard modern distributions which require at least 256 MB of
RAM. In fact, discard anything that doesn't work with 24 MB of RAM</li>
<li>Try to avoid old versions of current distros (i.e. Debian
Woody) because the ISOs and the packages might not be mirrored
anymore and are difficult to be found.</li>
<li>Use a distro which self-configures kernel modules on boot,
because I will be installing from a Virtual Machine and the
hardware will change between reboots. Recompiling the kernel is
totally out of the picture.</li>
<li>Kernel 2.4 if possible, to make both the audio and the Ethernet
work</li>
<li>As easy to configure as possible. I want to finish this in a
few hours... [Narrator: he didn't]</li>
</ol>

<p>I found myself with these contenders,
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a>,
<a href="http://puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a> and
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html">Tiny Core Linux</a>.</p>

<p>DSL v4 was the chosen one for many reasons. First, the default
software choice is a good compromise and finely tuned for
low performing machines. The installation seemed the easiest
of the three, and—very important—worked flawlessly inside
VirtualBox. The documentation is very extensive and, as a slightly
old distro, there are lots of manuals and forum posts with
solutions to common problems.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that DSL is based on Knoppix, so it detected
my hardware perfectly, didn't have to tweak the PCMCIA, and only
had to configure the audio manually because the I/O ports were not
the standard ones. This was a huge aid for me. PCMCIA Internet
working out of the box is something I hadn't even imagined to
have.</p>

<p>However, the decision also came with a few drawbacks. DSL has its
own "package manager", which only works from X and can't uninstall
packages. </p>

<p><code>apt-get</code> can be enabled, but it might break packages already installed with MyDSL.
Furthermore, those packages tend to disappear on a reboot for some reason. I'm
still unsure on whether to use apt-get with MyDSL. We will not be using it.</p>

<p>The ACPI doesn't work, but I don't know whether it's the kernel or the Libretto's
fault.</p>

<p>My biggest fear, however, is that most of the packages are old and
might have security issues. However, as this will not be my main
machine, and it won't run a browser with JavaScript enabled, I'm
not very worried.</p>

<p><strong>Why didn't I choose Tiny Core?</strong> because it didn't boot on a
VirtualBox machine with 24 MB of RAM. It would have been my first
choice, because it is better maintained than DSL. A real pity.</p>

<p><strong>And what about Puppy?</strong> The LiveCD is great but the installation
instructions were too complicated for me. I really didn't want to
spend that much time configuring everything. It is maybe too modern
(based on Slackware 13.37 with Kernel 3.1.10) and I doubt the
Libretto could have handled its kernel.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p><em>Please note: I will assume that you have some experience with Linux, partitioning, and installing stuff from a console.</em></p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>

<p>There are two alternatives: use floppy disks or physically remove
the drive and set up a VM. Years ago, I went the first path,
because I had the floppy disk drive. Since I don't have it
anymore, I found
<a href="http://davissharonforest.tripod.com/DebianLinux31onToshibaLibretto50.htm">an awesome tutorial</a>
which suggested to physically remove the drive from the Libretto,
attach it to a 2.5" IDE to USB adaptor, and install the system from
another computer. Check out his pictures for details on how to
remove the drive. My machine is in a bad condition
(broken hinges, cracks all over the case, stuck screws) and I had
to break some plastics and metal parts to access the drive.</p>

<p>So, we will use another Linux computer, which you probably already
have, and set up a virtual machine inside VirtualBox. Then, we will
remove the Libretto's physical HDD and attach it via USB to your
computer, using an adapter. The DSL CD image and the new /dev/sd
will be mapped inside the VM.</p>

<p>This way we can boot and install from a CD, instead of doing
netinsts with the Debian Woody diskettes, as you will read on many
other websites. It is the fastest and painless way, and if you
don't have the floppy drive, it is the only way.</p>

<p>If you have the floppy drive and are wondering if it is worth to
buy the adapter, go ahead! Walk the
difficult path, install DOS, start a Linux setup from DOS, try to
make the floppy disk work, then install from diskettes with a
crappy kernel, fight with the PCMCIA driver until you are able to
use the network, and install from the net. And, should the
installation fail, start OVER AGAIN! When this happens, please send
me an email so that I can pretend that I sympathize with you but
actually laugh at your misery.</p>

<p>Talking seriously, I am just trying to warn you.
I tried that, I failed, then I succeeded, and not even in my
success I want even the worst of my enemies going that path. Buy it, 
then come back and follow these instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the hard drive</strong></p>

<p>You already have the adapter? Great! I bought
this one which worked great and allowed me to manipulate the drive from my
main computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter" title=""></a></p>

<p>This is the adapter in its box. It comes with an enclosure that I
didn't use to avoid overheating, and a handy screwdriver.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter, close up" title=""></a></p>

<p>A close up of the IDE adapter. Don't buy a SATA one by mistake!</p>

<p><strong>Using the drive in VirtualBox</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, we will use VirtualBox to make DSL think it is
running on a real machine, and that the—now USB— hard drive is the
main drive of the VM. Turns out that using a physical disk from <code>/dev</code> on
VirtualBox isn't easy to find, but the actual command is simmple.</p>

<p><strong>Please make sure that your Linux has detected the USB drive as <code>/dev/sdb</code> before proceeding or you might lose data on the wrong disk!</strong>
If in case, use Disk Utility or check dmesg.</p>

<pre>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename disk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb
                                                                       ^^^^^^^^  &lt;-- check this
</pre>

<p>The command above will create a file named disk.vmdk, which is a
short plaintext file which references to <code>/dev/sdb</code>. You can now add
it to your VM using the normal VirtualBox Appliance Manager</p>

<p><strong>Partitioning</strong></p>

<p>Use your main Linux box to partition the hard drive. Disk Utility
works well, but I used cfdisk.</p>

<p>The tutorial then notes that the last 32MB of the disk space are
used for the Libretto's hardware Hibernate feature. I followed his
partition table suggestions completely. Just in case his page is
down, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/dev/hda1</code> 738.0 MB, <code>ext2</code> (ext3 is slower, but more secure),
mounted as <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>/dev/hda2</code> 40.3 MB, <code>swap</code></li>
<li>A remaining free space of 37.2 MB. Don't worry if the figure is
slightly higher or lower due to rounding.</li>
</ul>

  Introduction
</h2>


<p>Ketch is a very new open source <a href="https://theketch.io/">project by Shipa</a> that shares a similar concept with the Shipa DNA.</p>

<p>Ketch is heavily focused on easing out application deployments for developers, aiming for a situation where a developer does not have to write any YAML configuration files, and can directly deploy their application on any Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>In this post we will go through Ketch Concepts and then deploy an application to a <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100/">managed k3s cluster on Civo</a>.</p>

<p>The official definition of Ketch from Shipa is "an application delivery framework that facilitates the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes using a simple command line interface. No YAML required!"</p>

<p>This simply means that you can deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster by just using the Ketch CLI. But there is much more!</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying microservices and containerized applications, but there is a learning curve for a developer to get familiar with Kubernetes concepts, Kubernetes objects, how to write the required YAML files, and then how to create and manage them. These issues are there for any organization, big or small, as Kubernetes itself is complex and requires a lot of  knowledge to get up and running. Ketch works toward solving these issues by eliminating the need for writing YAML files and directly deploying applications onto a cluster.</p>

  Architecture

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1061.blog.png?1606373643" alt="Ketch architecture"></center>

<p>The above image is from the <a href="https://learn.theketch.io/docs/architecture">Ketch documentation</a>, and displays the architecture overview. Inside our cluster, we have a Ketch Controller, custom resource definitions (CRD) for the Pool and App, and an Ingress controller.</p>

<p><strong>Pool CRD</strong> - It's basically used to isolate different applications deployed. Each pool created will configure a namespace and other components onto the cluster.</p>

<p><strong>App CRD</strong> - Provides App context to applications and is responsible for running the application and managing its lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Ketch Controller</strong> - Monitors the changes that happen in the Pool and App CRDs. Ketch can also create a complete Helm chart for the application which can be used in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Ingress Controllers</strong> - As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports Traefik and Istio.</p>

  Prerequisites
</h2>


<ul>
<li>A Kubernetes cluster you control. We'll take advantage of <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100">Civo's super-fast managed k3s service</a> to experiment with this quickly. If you don't yet have an account, sign up to the beta now to take advantage of quick deploy times and $70 free credit per month! Alternatively, you could also use any other Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">kubectl installed</a>, and the <code>kubeconfig</code> file for your cluster downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1020.blog.png?1604672061" alt="Civo Kubernetes configuration"></center>

<p>Make sure you can connect to your Kubernetes cluster by running</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get nodes
</code></pre>

<p>You should see the names of the nodes in your cluster displayed.</p>

  Installing Ketch
</h3>


<p>First the Ketch Binary has to be downloaded in order to deploy the application to our Kubernetes cluster. In this case I am installing Ketch CLI on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipa-corp/ketch/main/install.sh | bash

Downloading Ketch binary from https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases/download/v0.1.0/ketch-darwin-amd64 to /usr/local/bin/ketch
Ketch client installation was successful

$ ketch -v
ketch version 0.1.0
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ingress-controller">
  <a href="#ingress-controller"><i></i></a>
  Ingress controller
</h3>


<p>As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports two ingress controllers, Traefik and Istio, with a plan to add more in the future. By default k3s comes with Traefik Ingress controller, which you can check using the following commands that show the pods that should include your Traefik pods, as well as the running service to manage traffic:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   metrics-server-7566d596c8-ks9ss          1/1     Running     0          5m45s

kube-system   traefik-758cd5fc85-2jf57                 1/1     Running     0          5m27s
kube-system   svclb-traefik-lz8bl                      2/2     Running     0          4m59s
kube-system   svclb-traefik-xz2r7                      2/2     Running     0          4m51s

$ kubectl get svc -A | grep traefik
kube-system   traefik-prometheus   ClusterIP      192.168.219.19    &lt;none&gt;            9100/TCP                     6m18s
kube-system   traefik              LoadBalancer   192.168.145.176   185.136.234.146  80:32596/TCP,443:30706/TCP   6m18s

</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Traefik comes pre-installed when you spin up a k3s cluster on Civo, and serves up an external IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - If you are using a different Kubernetes cluster make sure you install Traefik or Istio from <a href="https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch#install-ingress-controller">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cert-manager-install">
  <a href="#cert-manager-install"><i></i></a>
  Cert-Manager Install
</h3>


<p>Ketch Requires a certificate manager to be installed onto the cluster. This can be installed via the Civo Marketplace, either on the web on your cluster management page, or with <a href="https://www.github.com/civo/cli/">Civo CLI</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1058.blog.png?1606370955" alt="App marketplace"></center>

<pre><code># Installing cert-manager via civo cli, to our cluster called "ketch"
civo kubernetes applications add cert-manager --cluster=ketch
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a different or self-hosted Kubernetes cluster, you can install cert-manager by using the below command:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.3/cert-manager.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Whichever option you choose, check that cert-manager is running:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-cainjector-6d5dfbc779-jsrpj   1/1     Running   0          103s

cert-manager-webhook-59fccfc69b-xjwjt      1/1     Running   0          103s
</code></pre>

<h3 id="install-ketch-controller">

</h3>


<p>As we have seen in the Architecture section, our cluster will need a Ketch Controller that will be creating and watching the Pool CRD and App CRD.</p>

  Creating a Ketch Pool
</h3>


<p>Before deploying an app you need to create a Ketch pool. This is where we will need the external IP address of our ingress. We will get it by checking our Traefik service:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get svc -A | grep traefik
kube-system    traefik-prometheus                         ClusterIP      192.168.219.19    &lt;none&gt;            9100/TCP                     93m
kube-system    traefik                                    LoadBalancer   192.168.145.176   185.136.234.146   80:32596/TCP,443:30706/TCP   93m
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we run <code>ketch pool</code> to add our pool:</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool add saiyam  --ingress-service-endpoint 185.136.234.146 --ingress-type traefik
Successfully added!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running the above created a new namespace</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 0

$ kubectl get ns | grep saiyam
NAME              STATUS   AGE
ketch-saiyam      Active   20s
</code></pre>

<p>As of now there are 0 apps in the pool, so let's create an application</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app create hello --pool saiyam

$ ketch app list
NAME     POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                   DESCRIPTION
hello    saiyam    0        http://hello.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud

$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 1
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the App has 0 units as we have not deployed any app but just by creating the app, it created the endpoint automatically.</p>

<p>Now let's actually deploy an image onto the k3s cluster.</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app deploy demo -i docker.io/saiyam911/ketch-demo
Successfully deployed!

$ ketch app list
NAME    POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                  DESCRIPTION
demo    saiyam    1        http://demo.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud
</code></pre>

<p>The application has been deployed successfully from the image provided. If we visit the address provided by the <code>ketch app list</code> command above, we should see the following:</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Ketch has created a deployment and other Kubernetes objects to expose the application. Additionally, Ketch can export your application as a helm chart which can be used to distribute your application. This is a really cool feature in my opinion, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
	
	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thumb.png" alt="All Our Selves In One Basket thumbnail">
	
	

	
<p>There's a classic old idiom, "don't put your eggs all in one basket". The reasoning goes, what if the basket breaks? What if the basket isn't big enough, or gets stolen, or was cursed by a witch or something? It's important to have redundancy, to spread the eggs across many basket so that there's no one single point of failure.</p>
<p>But if we look at society, if we look at the internet, if we look at the communities we've built ourselves around... unfortunately, I believe that's exactly what a lot of us are doing. Being able to be yourself, being able to choose how you present yourself to the world, being able to tailor your living environment to your needs and desires? That's all very, very important. But if you give the keys to your self-expression and the options for the communities you belong in to one small, largely unknown group of people, that's not good.</p>
<p>In this ludicrously in-depth article, we'll be discussing how society limits both individual and community self-expression both online and offline.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Third Place</h2>
<p><img alt="A house, labeled '1', an office complex, labeled '2', and a '3' with a question mark" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thirdplace.png"></p>
<p>Very, very broadly speaking, a working-class person (that is, not an "owner" like a CEO, landlord, or investment banker) lives their life in three kinds of places. The first place is home. It's where you sleep, it's where you do your hobbies, it's where you have privacy and family and possibly friends if you want to invite them over. The second place is work, where you do a job to contribute to society and receive wages.</p>
<p>But clearly, we do more than that. We go to other places. Grocery stores and shops, of course, but besides that. The "third place" is where you spend your time in public, in your community. American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who came up with the concept of "the third place" in his 1989 book "The Great Good Place", defines the third place as (commonly seen as) eight characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no obligation to be here for legal, survival, political, etc. reasons. You can just <em>not show up</em>.</li>
<li>Everyone is equal. The rich, the poor, the minorities and the majorities all intermingle together in one common space.</li>
<li>Conversation and socializing is the main activity. You go here to "hang out".</li>
<li>They're accessible and accommodating for anyone who wants to visit.</li>
<li>It's a place where people regularly go, and whose regulars give the space its vibe and characteristics.</li>
<li>The physical place is not overly pretentious or imposed. It feels like <em>the community</em>, like an extension of home.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, the vibe here is more calm and friendly and playful than actively hostile and argumentative.</li>
<li>You feel like you have genuine ownership in the place, as if it's almost a communal home for you and the people you care about.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a relatively high bar, when spelled out like that. In pandemic-era America you'd be very hard pressed to name a place like this. Offline, anyways. But this sort of pattern has shown up a lot in history, because as it turns out people <em>like</em> having a communal space to just vibe in.</p>
<h3>The Town Square</h3>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo.jpg"></p>
<p>The most obvious example in urban environments is the town square or the plaza. It's an open area in the middle of town, usually with benches and close access to shops and homes and such. Pictured is <em>La Plaza del Zócalo</em>, the main square of Mexico City. It's been a meeting spot for the people of the area since the Aztec times, an important location for numerous historical events, and significant enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page. That's really amazing for a 240 m^2 slab of concrete. What's even more amazing is that it <em>wasn't</em> always a slab of concrete. Here's a model of how it looked in 1910.</p>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo1910.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a big park area! With a bunch of trees and benches and everything. Unfortunately, the very shaky politics of 20th century Mexico left the area in major disrepair by the 1970s, and it became that. I am not from Mexico, nor do I know anyone from the region, so I can't comment on what that did to the community in Mexico City. But as an outsider, I'd consider the 1910 Zócalo much more friendly and inviting than the modern one, which is literally a flat surface with a flagpole in the middle all surrounded by a busy road.</p>
<p>Obviously that isn't the only example. These tend to be a staple of small European and Hispanic towns. Just, a place, in your neighborhood, to go and chill. Other famous examples include the Roman Forum, the Greek Agoras, the National Mall of Washington D.C, and the "quads" or "diags" of most college campuses.</p>
<h3>Shopping Malls</h3>
<p>It is incredibly worth pointing out that town squares only make sense in urban contexts, where there's a dense population of people who live, work, and shop in one general area. The appeal of town squares is that they're basically on the way to wherever you're going, so it's a really nice spot to meet up with friends or just go if you're bored.</p>
<p>Suburbia is <em>not</em> that. Or, more accurately, it is that, <em>at the scale of the car.</em> See, America's fascination of suburban sprawl has a long detailed history to it. Paraphrasing from (imo) a very good book, "Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited" by Douglas S. Kelbaugh, the blame of sprawl can be pinned down largely on cultural reasons. First off, Americans always solved their resource and land division issues by expansion, growth, "moving out west". It was the safety valve to avoid actually thinking about difficult problems. At the time this was seen as the country's "manifest destiny", which eventually led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">unnervingly cheery songs on children's television happily glossing over the genocide of Native Americans like it was no big deal</a>. And, heck, if we got all this elbow room, why not make everything really, really big? Big houses, big rooms, big parcels of land. And really, really cheap too, because of the glutton of natural resources. And sure, that'll get old and worn sometime, but some of the population will leave for greener pastures anyways, so there's no need to change anything.</p>
<p>So, around the early-to-mid 20th century, when cities were getting too full of colored people who were just demanding rights too loudly, most of the rich white people just up and left. They settled suburban areas outside the cities, less densely populated, with all the backyard space you need to cook out with your neighbors. And via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>, it was possible to dig very deeply a concrete "us vs. them" line in the dirt. The newfangled highway system just made it easier to separate the houses from the factories, to drive a wedge in the population. Also, just to drive the point home, federal, state, and local governments have subsidized services like sewer pipe connections, energy, and road building, often funded by taxes generated from the more urban, more productive areas.</p>
<p>An incredibly good example of this is to compare Flint and Burton, MI to the surrounding cities of Grand Blanc, Flushing, and Davison. I could spend a lot of time on this but I'd rather just do a visual comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/grandblanc.jpg">
<img alt="Section of the Flint River of Flint, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/flintriver.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be laughably easy to tell which one is which. (The first pic is the Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, which was the first image Google gave me. The second pic is a section of the Flint River between downtown Flint and Kettering University. I took that pic during an urbex tour a few years back, because Flint was somewhat nearby and makes for <em>amazing</em> urbex pics.)</p>
<p>Where this starts to cause issues is that instead of having one core neighborhood with residential, commercial, <em>and</em> industrial areas (in a SimCity-esque model), we've split those sections into their own, largely independent areas, often harshly split on racial or class boundaries. We've got gigantic swaths of houses with maybe a corner store and a gas station, we've got giant industrial parks or office complexes, and we've got the commercial districts.</p>
<p>It's the commercial districts I really want to highlight here. If the residential areas are home, and the industrial/office parks are work, then clearly the third place is the commercial district. Now, there's two ways to approach that. </p>
<p><img alt="A strip mall" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/stripmall.jpg"></p>
<p>The most common approach is to just put a bunch of boxes next to each other, surround it with a parking lot, and call it "a strip mall". Occasionally there will also be a "big box" store, like a Wal-Mart or a Target or a Best Buy or a Kohl's or a Home Depot, either attached or detached.</p>
<p>In the very worst scenarios, you're subject to drive through the <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad">"stroad", or street-road</a>, where all the shops each have their own driveway and their own parking space and it's hostile to both people <em>and</em> cars.</p>
<p>You drive here (or take the bus, if you're poor and you're fine with the once-an-hour service), you shop, you drive home. You don't really spend time here. There is literally nothing here besides concrete boxes. And also the constant issue of cars driving past you. Hope you like sprinting across five lanes of traffic moving at 40 mph!</p>
<p>Enter Austrian-born architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen">Victor Gruen</a>. After fleeing to America from the Nazis, on account of being a Jewish socialist, he slowly worked up the career ladder, from draftsman to architect. And he absolutely saw the issues of suburban sprawl. In the 1950s he gave a speech where he called the suburbs "avenues of horror ... flanked by the greatest collection of vulgarity ... ever collected by mankind."</p>
<p><img alt="The Strand Arcade in Sydney CBD, Australia, opened 1892" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/arcade.jpg"></p>
<p>As an alternative, he envisioned a single building, a few shops surrounded by a shared courtyard, protected from the weather. Something of an iteration of the old "arcades", like the Strand Arcade in Sydney, Australia as pictured above. The courtyard was the most substantial improvement, it was somewhere to go <em>in between</em> shopping. The arcade was just a straight hallway normally, literally just shops in a building. The shopping mall was a <em>destination</em>.</p>
<p>Victor has larger goals in mind. He expected this to be just <em>one</em> part of a new, dense, suburban community.

<p>Here you can find a multi-boot uSD card image containing 17 different Pinephone distributions. 
The purpose of this image is for users to <b>easily try current major (and some minor) Pinephone Linux distributions</b>,
without having to figure out how to flash them individually and juggle with many uSD cards.

</p><p>Key points:

</p><ul>
	<li>[Relatively] small 6GiB image containing 17 distributions:
	<ul>
		<li>Arch Linux ARM 2020-11-21
		</li><li>Arch Linux ARM / dreemurrs 20201112
		</li><li>Lune OS 2020-11-23
		</li><li>Maemo Leste 20201101
		</li><li>Manjaro / Phosh beta2-20201119
		</li><li>Manjaro / Plasma 201122
		</li><li>Mobian 20201121
		</li><li>KDE Neon 20201123-084050
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Desktop 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / fbkeyboard 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / GNOME 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Mobile 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / Phosh 2020-11-21
		</li><li>Sailfish 1.1-3.3.0.16-devel-20201101
		</li><li>pmOS / sxmo nightly-202011090018
		</li><li>Ubuntu Touch 2020-11-19
		</li><li>Jumpdrive 0.6
	</li></ul>

	</li><li>Runs my <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot">p-boot</a> bootloader and <a href="http://xff.cz/git/linux">my latest kernel</a> (5.10-rc5)
	</li><li>Based on btrfs subvolumes and file level deduplication (if you mess up, you can easily revert each distribution to original state using pre-created btrfs snapshots)
	</li><li>All included distributions work on Braveheart and later Pinephone variants (incl. 3GiB variant), thanks to sharing my kernel and bootloader
	</li><li>My modem power management driver is used on all distributions for safe and reliable handling of modem power (instead of ad-hoc scripts used by original distributions)
	</li><li>Suspend to ram based on the latest crust is available to all distributions (whether they actually use it or not)
	</li><li>The image is made to fit a 16GiB or larger uSD cards, and also works when flashed to eMMC
</li></ul>

<p>Some development history and technical details can be found on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/">my blog</a>.

</p><p>There are some excellent presentations of the multi-boot image available on youtube:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of2I3cRY3VI">PinePhone multi-distro demo image (2)</a> by Avisando
	</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GjXQFnMHGY">Megi's multi-boot image for the PinePhone (with 17 Linux distros)</a> by Liliputing
</li></ul>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2020-11-23</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added more distros (Manjaro, Arch dreemurrs, Jumpdrive, pmOS / plasma desktop). Removed PureOS (doesn't seem to be maintained anymore).
</li><li>All distros updated to the latest versions.
</li><li>p-boot has more features, auto-repeat for volume keys, scrolling menu, reboot to eMMC OS, air-gapped boot mode, battery indicator.
</li><li>Newer kernel (5.10-rc5) with 60fps fix.
</li></ul>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<p>Most distributions don't need any patching to work with my latest 5.10 kernel and to be well behaved denizens of the multi-boot image. Nevertheless, some files still needed to be overrided. You can see those in the project's GIT repository, bellow.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>The image is distributed as a <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23.torrent">torrent</a> due to its size.
Install some torrent software (suggestions: <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">transmission</a>, <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>) and click the previous link to start the download.
Don't forget to let the torrent client run even after the download finishes so that other people can get the image too.
I only seed to the ratio of 10x at unlimited speed (1Gbit).

</p><p>The image is also available at: <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/">http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/</a> as a regular download.
 Download via HTTP is rate limited to 128 KiB/s. So if you want to get the image faster, use a torrent.

</p><p>There's also a mirror of the image by the discord user <b>uxes</b> at <a href="http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/">http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/</a>.

</p><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation consists of decompressing image data (gzipped) and to the SD card's whole block device. For example you can use <code>zcat multi.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M</code> (if you know how to identify your SD card's block device).

</p><p>Verify the image was written correctly immediately after flashing by running <code>dd if=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M count=10000 | sha256sum</code>.
SHA256 sum must be <code>25597ef407b4162a99ac53b144ca19227c4d15a653a4db8205eed2759c0c757d</code>.
 If your OS auto-mounts new filesystems, make sure it does not do it for the SD card image, otherwise the hash may change, and this verification method will be unreliable.

</p><p>Optionally (strongly encouraged step) you can also stretch the OS partition to fit your entire uSD card, otherwise the free space inside the filesystem will be limited to about 1.5 GiB, which is not enough for OS updates and/or longer term use of this image. If you run out of space, all included distributions may become unstable.

</p><p>Partition stretching instructions are on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/#toc-resizing-the-partition-after-flashing-the-image">this page</a>.

</p><h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>All passwords were changed to 1111 where possible. Manjaro password is 123456. Root passwords are 1111. sxmo login/password is mo/1111.

</p><h2>Support the project</h2>

<p>p-boot demo image generator is free and opensource software released under GPLv3.
It is an independent personal project not backed by any comapny or commercial interests.

		<p>I’m grateful to learn from my daughter. Be able to see how the brain develops and picks up new concepts, skills and words. Nowadays, I enjoy to sit down and watch her play. As a parent, I also need to help her to achieve her autonomy: emotionally, mentally and physically. It is the job, and my wife and I are navigating through it. There is not a guide on how to parent, and we discuss what is working and what is not working. Sometimes is just not the time for a new skill, other times our daughter doesn’t develop an interest for a particular activity. Well, we are all different, and that is what makes the world colourful!</p>

<p>Recently I was looking at one of the structures that we created to help our daughter to achieve her autonomy:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.joaorosa.io/images/assets/2020-11-25-organisational-structures-to-create-autonomy-what-i-ve-learned-from-my-daughter.jpg" alt="A tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks"></p>

<center>A learning tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks</center>

<p>Yes, you are seeing it right, we have what so-called a learning tower, allowing kids to achieve higher heights. They can climb and reach the countertops, with a high degree of safety. This one is on our bathroom, and she uses it to help her with her morning routine.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-heck-is-the-relationship-to-organisational-design">What the heck is the relationship to organisational design?!</h3>
<p>I can imagine that this is the question in your head. Well, I will continue to tell the story… We built the climbing towers after she started to walk without our help. My wife saw this concept in a parenting community, and we applied it. In the beginning, we asked our daughter if she wants to be in the climbing tower, and if she said yes, we would put her there. It was a “show and tell” type of style, given that it was a new concept to her. She used it for tasks such as brush her teeth, wash her hands, watch us cook, make a beverage. You can imagine the type of tasks.</p>

<p>What I observed across time, is that the brain embraced the concept, and when we nudge her for a task, let’s say, dinner, she would go to near the tower. It is a sign that she recognises the patterns, and knows the tools that can help her achieve the goal. Lately, she is proactive: we wake up in the morning, and she goes to the bathroom, climbs the tower and asks for her toothbrush. Most of the times, we don’t need to nudge her.</p>

<h3 id="applicability-to-organisations">Applicability to organisations</h3>
<p>With this story, I hope that I sparked your imagination. The bottom line is that as a manager, in a sociotechnical system, we should create structures that help people and teams to achieve their autonomy and agency. There is a wide range of practices, rituals and tools that can help, and all of them are context-dependent. To make it tangible, let’s say that you are a company with 375 people, and you are an online photo printing solution. The solution is in the cloud, and you take care of producing and deliver the photos worldwide. You have a diverse landscape, with custom software and standard hardware (printers). We rely on partners for the logistics operations, and you have a distributed workforce across the globe, to be close to the customers. You can picture other details… As director of software, you are responsible for the custom software that your customers are delighted for.</p>

<p>You can think about different practices, rituals and tools to help autonomy and agency within the company. Let’ explore some very concreate scenarios, which I hope you can relate with.</p>

<h5 id="onboarding-of-new-colleagues">Onboarding of new colleagues</h5>
<p>A new software engineer is hired. She will join one of the teams, and as part of the onboarding process, she has the starter pack, where she can find the information about the contact person for different operations. Information such as pension and salary declarations are requested to the HR department, vacations are booked in the internal portal, or the software development process can be consulted in the wiki. There is also a public schedule of the different rituals of the teams, such as demos.</p>

<p>The starter pack allows her to have an idea about the owners of different information and processes, allowing her to be autonomous. How many times did we move between jobs and at the same move between time houses? The real state agencies require a lot of paperwork, and most of it is provided by our employer.</p>

<h5 id="communities-of-practice">Communities of practice</h5>
<p>The company is growing, and the software was a monolith, managed by two teams, is now a distributed set of services. The services are loosely coupled and operated by 15 teams. As the complexity of the system increases, the teams adopted principles of observability, and they nail logging and metrics. However, they want to invest in tracing, to increase their capabilities, and streamline the development and operations processes.</p>

<p>As such, a community of practice was created. People from different teams come together, and work on common problems, with the end in mind. It allows space to co-create, diverge and converge, experiment, until patterns and practices start to emerge, and are useful to the different teams. Other community practices can exist and be in different areas. This is not a “or” exercise, is more like a “and” one.</p>

<p>Communities of practice enable agency of teams, where they can continue to align with the organisation purpose, but devise their own way to execute their mission.</p>

<h5 id="a-new-service-is-added-to-the-landscape">A new service is added to the landscape</h5>
<p>The company is leveraging cloud services for the last 7 years, but recently they start to move their services from infrastructure-as-a-service to cloud-native, where applicable. It has an impact on the services and the way they are bootstrapped and wired. The platform team created a few templates with different goals: on one side how to migrate the services when the paradigm changes, and on the other side if you do a new service what are the barebones to bootstrap the basics (authentication, authorisation, monitoring, etc.)</p>

<p>Having these templates, a team reduce their lead time to create a new service. The templates and documentation allow them to understand how things are wired and how cloud-native can be leveraged. Once again, the teams can maintain their agency, reducing the burned over the platform team for the creation of new services. Also, there is a change for evolution, as teams can contribute to the templates, co-evolving them as new insights are generated.</p>

<h3 id="organisations-are-complex-sociotechnical-systems">Organisations are complex sociotechnical systems</h3>
<p>My goal with the examples is to provide some relatable scenarios, and I believe that stories are a great vehicle to convey a message. However, stories are context bounded, and the way that people or teams achieve something might not be feasible in a different context. Thus, my statement that ** organisations are complex sociotechnical systems**, and as a manager, we need to be aware of the complexity theory and how to navigate the inherent complexity.</p>

<p>I’m a student of complexity theory, and Cynefin, the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/snowded">Dave Snowden</a>. Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework, allowing us to make sense of the world. I will not go into the details of Cynefin, this is not the goal of the blog post, nor I’m a specialist. I’m just a student.</p>

<p>My point is that you can use Cynefin to make sense of the different needs of your organisation and help people to set-up the additional structures to create agency and autonomy. A great story that exemplifies it is “Cultivating Leadership with Cynefin: from tool to mindset” from Jennifer Garvey-Berger, Carolyn Coughlin, Keith Johnston and Jim Wicks, in the book <a href="https://www.cognitive-edge.com/cynefin-weaving-sense-making-into-the-fabric-of-our-world/">Cynefin, weaving sense-making unto the fabric of our world</a>. In this story, they show us how an organisation grow, and what were the structures that they added to allow the autonomy of the consultants, allowing their consultancy practice to evolve - a prime example of a Teal organisation.</p>

<p>Sometimes organisational structures to create autonomy and agency are not used on the spot. You need to nudge the system, observe and reflect. Sometimes the concept is new, and people and teams are getting used to it, trying to find the applicability. Other times, the structure is useless, and if that is the case just discard it. As I wrote in the beginning, our daughter got used to the learning tower, and across time increased her autonomy.</p>

<p>I hope this sparked some ideas with you. What are the organisational structures that allow autonomy and agency in your company?</p>

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

The sound ranging equipment used six tuned low frequency â€˜<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1921.0011">microphones</a>â€™</span><span> (indicated by the six parallel lines on the film) arranged in a wide arc behind allied lines. The microphones were connected to a string galvanometer at a forward listening position. A low frequency signal picked up by one of these microphones would move a thin wire in the galvanometer and cast a shadow onto a piece of moving film.</span></p><p><span>The equipment takes advantage of both the consistency and relative difference between the speed of sound and the speed of light to create a visual recording of the sound impulses which would arrive at the microphones after the flash of the guns being fired. An operator would wait for the flash of an enemy gun to start the film rolling and the equipment would record the signals as they arrived progressively based on their proximity to the impulse source. </span></p><p><span>The film took around five minutes to develop after which trained analysts could decode the patterns on the film and use them to work out the positions of enemy guns using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_sound_ranging#cite_note-LawCosines-2">multilateration</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>By the end of WW1 sound ranging techniques could locate enemy guns within 25m to 50m under normal atmospheric conditions and even determine the <a href="https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/OrderOfBattle/Thesis/index.html">caliber, number of guns and the target</a></span><span>. &nbsp;The document above gives us a great insight into how intense and chaotic the barrage of gunfire must have been to those fighting. The missing section that has been edited out of the film in the middle of the image also begs the question â€œwhat would those 2 minutes have sounded like?â€�</span></p><p><b>Forensic sound</b></p><p><span>Using this document, the team at IWM were keen for us to try and create an interpretation of how this â€˜missingâ€™ moment might have sounded as the introduction to a series of exhibitions they were working on to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War.</span></p><p><span>In order to go about creating a reconstruction, we had do a bit of â€˜forensicâ€™ work, corroborating historical information about the type of artillery that would have been in use by the US, German and French armies at this point in the war, with what the visual information from the sound ranging film tells us about the size, distance and frequency of blasts and finally, interpreting the kind of reverberation you would have expected to hear by looking at landscape photographs and archive film footage from the front.</span></p><p><span>As its basis, our reconstruction uses contemporary recordings of the Howitzer, Mauser, Stokes, Vickers and Lee Enfield guns made for the purposes of sound design in film and television</span><span>. These recordings were then grouped and triggered according to who was using them and in patterns that corresponded to archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2lGzfuJaok">newsreel</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMf5MmicGlQ">footage</a> taken at the front</span><span>. The density of the gunfire was interpreted both from the sound ranging document and further archive footage. All of these elements were mixed together relative to each other and with respect to the distances over which the fighting was taking place. Finally, a convolution reverb</span><span> with an impulse response recorded in a relative â€˜free fieldâ€™ scenario was used to simulate the space and dispersion of the sound across the front</span>.</p><p><strong>Feeling sound: bone conduction</strong></p><p><span>The team at IWM were very keen to present this unique document and our reconstruction in a way that would not only bring them to life, but also make explicit the relationship between them for visitors. With this in mind, we drew inspiration from the mechanics of the â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment itself.</span></p><figure id="attachment_1477" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1477"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg.webp 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg.webp 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="335" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1477">A French ‘sound ranging’ system from 1920s</figcaption></figure><p><span>The â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment that was deployed at the end of &nbsp;WW1 used an innovative Low Frequency Microphone developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sansome_Tucker">William Sansome Tucker</a></span><span> in 1916. &nbsp;This microphone used a Helmholtz resonator to detect the physical vibrations of low frequencies of the guns in order to record them onto film</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™ and the fact that the explosions of the guns firing would have been felt as shock waves by soldiers at the same time as being heard led us to the idea of trying to incorporate bone conduction into the exhibit, as a way of tying together our reconstruction with the physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™.</span></p><p><strong>How does bone conduction work?</strong></p><p>Normally sound waves reach our ears as vibrations travelling through the air to our eardrums, and then on to the Cochlea or inner ear, which is connected to the auditory nerve that transmits the sounds to our brain.</p><p>However, the ear is a very sensitive organ and it can also pick up vibrations through our skulls. The most obvious example of this is when you go to the dentist and have your teeth cleaned.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I made a big mistake.</p><p>It was at the end of December of 2019, and I started working right away on my idea. A platform to send newsletters.</p><p>I spent six months working on it. Every day. From Monday to Sunday, until I had an MVP. I was very proud of what I created, and I wanted to share it with the world.</p><p>The results: Zero clients.</p><p>I was expecting people to try it, at least out of curiosity or to think about using it. But no one did.</p><p>Is the project a failure because I have zero clients?</p><p>1 - The site only had around 4K visits so far. That's not enough.<br>2 - From those people, 99% were visits from places like Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, BetaList, etc. Are they my clients? Maybe not.</p><p>I have two big reasons to consider this a failure.</p><h3><strong>1 - I still need to put in twelve more months of work</strong>.</h3><p>To add paid newsletters, static pages, a better writing editor, a blogging experience, custom domains…. If I want to create those, I need to spend at least another 12 months. Probably more.</p><p>And for what? Adding more features is not going to help with finding clients because they won't see them.</p><h3><strong>2 - I need to find clients</strong>.</h3><p>I am sure that you can make a lot of money from a service like this. </p><p>The problem is, if I code, I can't do sales or marketing. It seems to me that there are at least 3 full-time jobs to do simultaneously, and that's too big for me.</p><p>I was naive when I started.</p><h2><strong>What was my big mistake?</strong></h2><p>I wanted to create a Micro-Saas. I wasn't looking to be a big company. I thought to have 500-1000 clients and make 10/20K per month.</p><p>I wanted to create a family business. Pay salaries for a couple of people and flying low. I wasn't looking for attention. I didn't want to be the greatest entrepreneur.</p><p>My big mistake was to think that creating a SaaS was easy. At least easier. I was expecting to have 50/100 clients in the first couple of months. I thought: "Internet is big, they will come."</p><p>And there is some truth to that, but I learned after that you need to find them. Or spend money on ads. Or both.</p><p>And I don't know how to do it, and I don't have a budget for that or the experience.</p><h3><strong>What do I mean by "I quit"?</strong></h3><p>I quit big projects that keep me attached to my desk for years and infinity hours. Projects that you can never say: done. A SaaS is never done.</p><p>Last week I created and launched&nbsp;<a href="http://slideslist.com/">slideslist.com</a>. It took me a week to create it. It had some visits and no sales, but it doesn't matter. No risks were taken and minimal effort.</p><h3>How to know if you should start a project?</h3><p>If you are starting today, you should start small. It would be best if you learn first. Start by creating a SaaS is too big and risky in time, money, and effort or even Micro-SaaS. The "micro" doesn't reflect the effort you need to put in anyway.</p><p>Create something small in less than a month and try to sell it. You will see how hard it is and how many people tell you: "nice! I will take a look later" And they will never do. So then you learn, and you keep trying small things until you have enough experience.</p><p>Even enough experience to realize that creating a SaaS is not for you. Like I learned.</p><h2><strong>Do You Need to Create a SaaS?</strong></h2><p>I’d say probably not, but I am still figuring this out.</p><p>I started this to be free. And being free involves, of course, having more money. But I don't want to buy a fancy car or a big house. You can make a lot of money from a SaaS, but there are also other ways to make money online. </p><p>The problem with the SaaS I was creating is that I was giving away my freedom by doing things that I wasn't enjoying. But I didn't want to spend every single hour of the day adding more features and at the same time trying to find clients.</p><p>If that's what you want, that's fantastic, go ahead and start a SaaS. But that's not what I wanted.</p><p>I romanticized the idea of travel and writing. And that's what I want. I wanted to make money to write, to share lessons on the things that I think are valuable for people to have a better and more balanced life.</p><p><strong>Know yourself.</strong></p><p>If I wanted to write, why was I spending my time creating a SaaS?</p><p><strong>Now I am writing, and let’s see from here.</strong></p><p>Thanks to this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-losing-38676-as-an-indie-hacker-i-cant-do-it-anymore-i-quit-8673223598">article</a>&nbsp;I published telling my story I learned that I might not have to create a SaaS to start living the life I want.</p><p>People paid me for it, and I made a good amount of money. It paid my rent for the month, and that blew my mind.</p><p>So I decided to start a newsletter and a blog and start writing about the things I enjoy. Who knows if in the future I will go back again trying to create a big project, but for now, I’m going to try something small that is also fun to do for me. </p><p>👉&nbsp;If you liked this article, share it with your friends!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">



<hr>
 


<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe4e3e9">
<h2 id="h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620"><span>1</span> <a href="#h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">Motivation</a></h2>
<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbde706a">
<h2 id="h-3820d027-5602-4691-b9ca-b36aadd3871a"><span>2</span> <a href="#h-3820d027-5602-4691-b9ca-b36aadd3871a">Side note: The Canvas</a></h2>
<p>
This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3e178ba">
<h2 id="h-a71813d2-7e36-4f52-b22c-87e22d4a2620"><span>3</span> <a href="#h-a71813d2-7e36-4f52-b22c-87e22d4a2620">Color Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0a664e8">
<h3 id="h-99356355-d54c-41d8-bc1a-6e14e29f42c8"><span>3.1</span> <a href="#h-99356355-d54c-41d8-bc1a-6e14e29f42c8">RGB</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-99356355-d54c-41d8-bc1a-6e14e29f42c8">
<p>
The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

<div id="outline-container-orgfc9a41c">
<h3 id="h-43869bc7-a7d1-410f-9341-521974751dac"><span>3.2</span> <a href="#h-43869bc7-a7d1-410f-9341-521974751dac">HSL</a></h3>

<p>
Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>


<p><a href="http://notes.neeasade.net/assets/posts/color_cylinder.png"><img src="http://notes.neeasade.net/assets/posts/color_cylinder.png" alt="color_cylinder.png"></a>
</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:

<p>Novel deep learning models in medical imaging appear one after another. The thing that  these models still significantly lack is the ability to generalize to unseen clinical data. Unseen data refer to real-life conditions that are typically different from the ones encountered during training. So when we want to apply a model in clinical practice, we are likely to fail. Furthermore, the provided training data is often limited. This constricts the expressive capability of deep models, as their performance is bounded by the number of data. And the only solution is to find more data. Since it is not always possible to find the exact supervised data you want, you may consider transfer learning as a choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transfer learning will be the next driver of ML success ~ Andrew Ng, NeurIPS 2016 tutorial</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In natural images, we always use the available pretrained models. We may use them for image classification, object detection, or segmentation. And surprisingly it always works quite well. This mainly happens because RGB images follow a distribution. The shift between different RGB datasets is not significantly large. Admittedly, medical images are by far different. <strong>Each medical device produces images based on different physics principles. Subsequently, the distribution of the different modalities is quite dissimilar</strong>. The reason we care about it?</p>

<p>Transfer learning of course! If you want to learn the particularities of transfer learning in medical imaging, you are in the right place.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-transfer-learning">What is Transfer Learning?</h2>

<p>Let’s say that we intend to train a model for some task X (domain A). Thus, we assume that we have acquired annotated data from domain A. A task is our objective, image classification, and the domain is where our data is coming from. In medical imaging, think of it as different <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">modalities</a>. When we directly train a model on domain A for task X, we expect it to perform well on unseen data from domain A. What happens if we want to train a model to perform a new task Y?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In transfer learning, we try to store this knowledge gained in solving a task from the source domain A and apply it to another domain B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source and target task may or may not be the same. In general, we denote the target task as Y. We store the information in the weights of the model. Instead of random weights, we initialize with the learned weights from task A. If the new task Y is different from the trained task X then the last layer (or even larger parts of the networks) is discarded.</p>

<em>An overview of transfer learning. Image by Author</em></p>

<p>For example, for image classification we discard the last hidden layers. In encoder-decoder architectures we often pretrain the encoder in a downstream task. But how different can a domain be in medical imaging? What kind of tasks are suited for pretraining? What parts of the model should be kept for fine tuning?</p>

<p>We will try to tackle these questions in medical imaging.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-from-imagenet-for-2d-medical-image-classification-ct-and-retina-images">Transfer learning from ImageNet for 2D medical image classification (CT and Retina images)</h2>

<p>Obviously, there are significantly more datasets of natural images. The most common one for transfer learning is ImageNet, with more than 1 million images. Therefore, an open question arises: How much ImageNet feature reuse is helpful for medical images?</p>

<p>Let’s introduce some context. ImageNet has 1000 classes. That’s why pretrained models have a lot of parameters in the last layers on this dataset. On the other hand, medical image datasets have a small set of classes, frequently less than 20. So, the design is suboptimal and probably these models are overparametrized for the medical imaging datasets.</p>

<p>In the case of the work that we‘ll describe we have chest CT slices of 224x224 (resized) that are used to diagnose 5 different thoracic pathologies: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, and pleural effusion. The RETINA <a href="https://github.com/yiweichen04/retina_dataset" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dataset</a> consists of retinal fundus photographs, which are images of the back of the eye.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/fundus-photograph.png" alt="fundus-photograph">
<em>A normal fundus photograph of the right eye. Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

<p>Such images are too large (i.e. 3 x 587 × 587) for a deep neural network.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this 3-channel image is not even close to an RGB image. To understand the impact of transfer learning, Raghu et al [1] introduced some remarkable guidelines in their work: “Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging”.</p>

<p>In general, one of the main findings of [1] is that transfer learning <strong>primarily helps the larger models</strong>, compared to smaller ones. Intuitively, it makes sense! Smaller models do not exhibit such performance gains. Moreover, for large models, such as ResNet and InceptionNet, pretrained weights learn different representations than training from random initialization. Apart from that, large models change less during fine-tuning, especially in the lowest layers.</p>

<p>To address these issues, the Raghu et al [1] proposed two solutions:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Transfer the scale (range) of the weights instead of the weights themselves</strong>. This offers feature-independent benefits that facilitate convergence. In particular, they initialized the weights from a normal distribution \(N(\mu; \sigma)\). The mean and the variance of the weight matrix is calculated from the pretrained weights. This calculation was performed for each layer separately. As a result, the new initialization scheme inherits the scaling of the pretrained weights but forgets the representations. The following plots illustrate the pre-described method (Mean Var) and it’s speedup in convergence.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/accuracy-2d-medical-image-pretraining.png" alt="accuracy-2d-medical-image-pretraining">
<em>The effect of ImageNet pretraining. Image by [1] <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07208" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>2) <strong>Use the pretrained weights only from the lowest two layers</strong>. The rest of the network is randomly initialized and fine-tuned for the medical imaging task. This hybrid method has the biggest impact on convergence. To summarize, most of the most meaningful feature representations are learned in the lowest two layers.</p>

<p>Finally, keep in mind that so far we refer to 2D medical imaging tasks. What about 3D medical imaging datasets?</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-for-3d-mri-brain-tumor-segmentation">Transfer Learning for 3D MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation</h2>

<p>Wacker et al. [4] attempt to use ImageNet weight with an architecture that combines ResNet (ResNet 34) with a decoder. In this way, they simply treat three MRI modalities as RGB input channels of the</p>

<p>pretrained encoder architecture. The pretrained convolutional layers of ResNet used in the downsampling path of the encoder, forming a <a href="https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/" target="_blank">U-shaped</a> architecture for <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/" target="_blank">MRI segmentation</a>.</p>

<p>To process 3D volumes, they extend the 3x3 convolutions inside ResNet34 with 1x3x3 convolutions. Thereby, the number of parameters is kept intact, while pretrained 2D weights are loaded. Simply, the ResNet encoder simply processes the volumetric data slice-wise. They used the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brats dataset</a> where you try to segment the different types of tumors. The different tumor classes are illustrated in the Figure below.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/per-class-score-tumor-segmentation.png" alt="per-class-score-tumor-segmentation">
<em>Image by Wacker et al. [4]. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12452.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>The results of the pretraining were rather marginal. Moreover, this setup can only be applied when you deal with exactly three modalities. However, this is not always the case.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-for-3d-lung-segmentation-and-pulmonary-nodule-classification">Transfer Learning for 3D lung segmentation and pulmonary nodule classification</h2>

<p>In general, 10%-20% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed via a pulmonary nodule detection. According to Wikipedia [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_nodule" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6</a>]: “A <strong>lung nodule</strong> or <strong>pulmonary nodule</strong> is a relatively small focal density in the lung. It is a mass in the lung smaller than 3 centimeters in diameter. The nodule most commonly represents a benign tumor, but in around 20% of cases, it represents malignant cancer.”</p>

<em>Pulmonary nodule detection. The image is taken from <a href="med3d:%20Transfer%20Learning%20for%203D%20Medical%20Image%20Analysis">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>Let’s go back to our favorite topic. So, if transferring weights from ImageNet is not that effective why don’t we try to add up all the medical data that we can find? Simple, but effective! Chen et al. collected a series of public CT and MRI datasets. Most of the data can be found on <a href="http://medicaldecathlon.com/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Medical Image Decathlon</a>. Nonetheless, the data come from different domains, modalities, target organs, pathologies. They use a family of 3D-ResNet models in the encoder part. The decoder consists of transpose convolutions to upsample the feature in the dimension of the segmentation map. To deal with multiple datasets, different decoders were used. The different decoders for each task are commonly referred to as “heads” in the literature. The depicted architecture is called Med3D. Below you can inspect how they transfer the weights for image classification.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/med-3d-architecture.png" alt="med-3d-architecture">
<em>An overview of the Med3D architecture [2]</em></p>

<p>To deal with multi-modal datasets they used only one modality. They compared the pretraining on medical imaging with Train From Scratch (<strong>TFS</strong>) as well as from the weights of the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kinetics</a>, which is an action recognition video dataset. I have to say here, that I am surprised that such a dataset worked better than TFS! The results are much more promising, compared to what we saw before.</p>

<p>This table exposes the need for large-scale medical imaging datasets. ResNet’s show a huge gain both in segmentation (left column) as well as in classification (right column). Notice that lung segmentation exhibits a bigger gain due to the task relevance. In both cases, only the encoder was pretrained.</p>

will not cover React fundamentals and focus on implementing login, registration
and so on.</p><p>To make things a bit easier, we will use <a href="https://expo.io/"><code>expo</code></a>. At a
minimum, you need NodeJS and NPM installed locally. We will use the ORY Kratos
React Native Login, Registration and Profile Management template:</p><div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> -g expo-cli</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span>expo init login-signup-app -t @oryd/expo-login-registration-template --npm</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> <span>We also want to <span>install</span> and initialize all required components:</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> login-signup-app</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> i</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> run expo-install</span></span>
<span><span>#</span> <span>For iOS you also need to run:</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> run pod-install</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In case you want to just start exploring, simply run:</p><ul><li><code>npm start</code> opens a dashboard where you can open iOS, Android, or web.</li><li><code>npm run android</code> opens the app as an android app (requires a connected
android VM or device).</li><li><code>npm run ios</code> opens the app in the iOS simulator (works only on mac OSX).</li><li><code>npm run web</code> opens the app as a browser app.</li></ul><p><span>

      <p>Hiring is always hard, but the more specialized your hire, the harder it will be. If you’re managing a technical blog and you want to <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/finding-motivating-writers">stop writing everything yourself</a>, you’ll need to recruit and hire technical writers to help you out.</p>

<p>While traditionally used in education, rubrics are a fantastic tool for hiring, and I’ve used them for years both as <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/developing-talent">an engineering manager</a> and content manager at Draft. Whether you are bringing on a part-time freelancer or a full-time hire, having a good rubric will help you <a href="https://www.managementcenter.org/article/mitigate-bias-in-hiring-with-a-simple-rubric/">objectively evaluate candidates</a> and keep you focused on the criteria that matter for your job.</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-hiring-rubric">What is a Hiring Rubric?</h2>
<p>A hiring rubric is a document that defines the criteria you use to decide whether a candidate is a good fit for your role or not. It typically includes several attributes upon which you will evaluate candidates and a few levels within each attribute that measure their skill.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PaRd7YK.png" alt="A template for a rubric with three attributes and four levels"></p>

<p>To effectively use a rubric, you need to apply it consistently using measurable and observable behaviors. This means that a good rubric eliminates hiring by “gut feel” and forces you to stay focused on the characteristics that candidates display throughout the hiring process.</p>


      


      
<h2 id="the-draftdev-rubric-for-hiring-technical-writers">The Draft.dev Rubric for Hiring Technical Writers</h2>
<p>As I started hiring more writers for <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, I began refining a rubric that would allow me to evaluate them quickly and objectively. Today, I’m sharing this rubric with you so you can use it as a starting point for creating your own hiring rubric.</p>

<p>Our rubric currently has ten attributes that fall within three broad categories. Each of these attributes has 3-4 levels we can use to compare writers. We use this rubric to decide which candidates to bring on during the hiring process and as an ongoing evaluation tool for our existing writers. This strategy helps us consistently provide high-quality technical work for our clients.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceZ5q510lDLGR8U3SFJdXEePAeaqARes_l6lmXBndms/edit?usp=sharing">get a copy of the rubric here</a> or read on for an explanation of how we evaluate writers using this rubric.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceZ5q510lDLGR8U3SFJdXEePAeaqARes_l6lmXBndms/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="https://draft.dev/learn/assets/posts/hiring-rubric.png" alt="Hiring rubric for technical writers"></a></p>

<h3 id="category-1-writing">Category 1: Writing</h3>
<p>Writing skills are necessary for the kind of work we do at Draft.dev, but defining what it means to be a “good” writer is surprisingly hard. Many people use the, “I know it when I see it” test, but I’ve found that insufficient. There are three attributes I look for in strong writers.</p>

<h4 id="conventions">Conventions</h4>
<p>Grammar and spelling errors can be overcome. With tools like Grammarly, we can edit a writer with decent conventions, but submitting samples full of mistakes points to a problem with attention to detail. Every writer makes mistakes, but that doesn’t forgive sloppiness.</p>

<p>Writers who have mastered conventions will submit error-free work and may even spot mistakes in others’ work during the application process.</p>

<h4 id="language">Language</h4>
<p>English is a tough language to master. As such, many non-native writers will struggle to word things in a way that native readers find natural. For example, the phrase, “Let me explain you the reasons I believe this to be true,” is missing a preposition and somewhat strangely worded. It’s not glaringly incorrect, but it shows a deficiency in language that is common among inexperienced writers.</p>

<p>Writers who have strong language skills use engaging words, varied sentence structure, and stylistically sophisticated vocabulary that isn’t overly wordy. It’s tough to do.</p>

<h4 id="organization">Organization</h4>
<p>Finally, great writers have to be great organizers. While having <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/content-plan">good content briefs with outlines</a> can help with higher-level structure, the writer will still have to decide how to present sequential information in a way that readers can grok.</p>

<p>To reach the highest level in this attribute, writers must create clear transitions between topics and consistent focus throughout the entire sample piece.</p>

<h3 id="category-2-technical">Category 2: Technical</h3>
<p>As a technical content agency, Draft.dev’s writers must have specialized experience. While not every piece we produce requires deep knowledge about a specific technical topic, writers must research, understand, and speak to technical topics.</p>

<h4 id="development">Development</h4>
<p>In this context, “development” doesn’t mean software development skills - it means the ability to develop and present an idea. A well-developed piece of writing goes beyond the step-by-step “how” and builds the “why” as well.</p>

<p>A writer who can present their main idea and strongly support it with technical evidence while keeping the “why” central to the work will get full points in this category.</p>

<h4 id="depth">Depth</h4>
<p>Technical depth describes the writer’s ability to go beyond entry-level writing on the topic at hand. Regurgitation of the “getting started” walkthrough is not that useful for the writing we do with our clients. Writers need to show that they understand the underlying technical justification for their decisions.</p>

<p>Writers who display depth of knowledge usually have years of real-world experience and knowledge of the technology’s inner-workings.</p>

<h4 id="demand">Demand</h4>
<p>Technical knowledge is spiky. A writer may know a lot about Rust, but nothing about Python, so while they can display depth by diving into the Rust compiler, if none of our clients need Rust writers, their skills aren’t in demand right now. While technical writers usually have two or three areas where they can contribute, their skills have to match up with our clients’ needs to be a good fit.</p>

<p>Writers with unique combinations of skills or experience that happens to match our clients’ technology stack will do the best in this category.</p>

<h4 id="correctness">Correctness</h4>
<p>Finally, writers must be technically correct. This is usually linked closely to depth - if a writer can’t go deep on a topic, they are less likely to get the details right - but not always. For example, a writer might create some sample code that doesn’t work even though their explanations are on-point.</p>

<p>Writers will get the most credit in this category when they have no factual errors, and all their assumptions are backed up with evidence or experience.</p>

<h3 id="category-3-work">Category 3: Work</h3>
<p>The last category is work habits. Even great writers who are technically qualified may be a bad fit for Draft.dev if they’re not consistent team players. Each of our writers works remotely as an independent contractor, so their ability to communicate, respond positively to feedback, and work independently are important to their success.</p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
<p>While writing skills are evaluated in the first category, our writers must also be responsive, prompt communicators. With clients and writers around the world, we don’t have set “working hours,” but we require writers to respond to emails and requests for revisions within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>The best writers proactively notify their editor with questions or delays as early as possible and communicate their progress along the way.</p>

<h4 id="attitude">Attitude</h4>
<p>As a writer, you have to be able to handle feedback - both positive and negative. Edits aren’t a personal attack, so we look for writers who actively seek out feedback. Great writers at Draft.dev enjoy the guidance we offer rather than seeing it as a burden.</p>

<h4 id="independence">Independence</h4>
<p>Finally, our technical writers have to be able to solve problems independently. This doesn’t mean they can’t ask questions - they should reach out proactively when stuck - but they should start projects early in case anything comes up.</p>

<h2 id="we-can-help-you-create-great-technical-blog-content">We Can Help You Create Great Technical Blog Content</h2>
<p>I hope our rubric helps you hire better technical writers, but I also hope it shows you how tough finding great writers can be. If you’re not sure about hiring your own writers, we might be able to help. At <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, we write technical content for software engineering blogs using our pool of highly skilled technical writers. We also offer content planning and editing services.</p>

<p><em>“Should I buy this or not?”</em> Ever since the invention of money (and even before that), this very sensible question accompanies our buying decision. And of course not only for cars, handbags, and trampolines – but also when it comes to buying <strong>software tools</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m no expert when it comes to cars, handbags, and trampolines – but as the CEO and founder of “<a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower</a>” (a desktop GUI for the Git version control system), I have both opinions and some expertise when it comes to SaaS software tools. Of course, my background in a small software company means that I’m highly biased in this matter! But I want to invite you to consider if my <em>arguments</em> might be true, independent of my own bias.</p>



<h2>The ROI of Software Tools is Almost Always Fantastic</h2>



<p>Here is my bold statement: in many cases, <strong>the return on investment is fantastic when it comes to software tools you use for your work</strong>. Let me tell you why I am so convinced that this is true.</p>



<h2>The Benefits of Good Software Tools</h2>



<p>Great software tools come with a host of benefits:</p>



<ol><li><strong>They make you more productive.</strong> For your private purposes, it might be enough if you keep track of tasks you have to do in a simple text file (or even on a piece of paper). But when it comes to your professional work – and especially in a team context – these overly simplistic solutions just won’t cut it. In our team, we are using “<a href="https://www.asana.com/">Asana</a>” to keep track of tasks and projects. And it would be so much harder and cost so much more time if we tried to do this manually! The same logic is true for a tool like “<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/">SourceLevel</a>“: instead of manually pulling together data from various sources, it helps you get a thorough overview of your Pull Request and Code Review metrics quicker and with less effort. <em>Not</em> using these tools – with the intention of trying to save a few bucks – very quickly backfires when it impairs your productivity (and more importantly: the productivity of your whole team)!</li><li><strong>They allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them.</strong> Our own product is a perfect example for this statement: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower, the Git desktop GUI</a> that we make, helps developers to access advanced features of the Git version control system – which, due to the high complexity and steep learning curve of Git, they wouldn’t be able to use (or wouldn’t even be aware of) without Tower. Many software developers claim to know Git. But when it comes to more advanced features like Interactive Rebase, Submodules, or the Reflog, they either don’t know/ don’t use them – or they simply can’t use them efficiently. Anyone who has ever performed an Interactive Rebase operation, with its many manual steps, quickly comes to love Tower, where the same operation is possible via simple drag and drop!</li><li><strong>They reduce mistakes.</strong> I can vividly remember the stress and the anxiety I used to feel when I had to update our website: I would connect to our live server with an FTP program and replace some files with updated versions. This is the equivalent of open heart surgery, which means that a fair amount of stress is not surprising: there are a lot of things that can go wrong and cause a real mess! This whole scenario, for us, lies many years in the past and looks very different from how we do things today: for our marketing websites, we’re using a service called “<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>” that makes this process a lot easier. And to run the build process for our main Tower app, we’re using the popular “<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>” service. Using both of these services (instead of doing things manually) has greatly reduced our error rate – and thereby saved us lots of hours of putting out fires.</li><li><strong>They free your time for more important work.</strong> As the CEO of a small tech company, my schedule is naturally pretty busy. And as anyone knows who has ever tried to find time on <em>multiple</em> people’s calendars: this is really time consuming work! Offering multiple alternative dates that block your calendar for days, looping in multiple people in multiple time zones, and all the back-and-forth emailing connected with this make these things a true nightmare. This is why I’m happily paying a hundred bucks for a yearly subscription of “<a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>” In a nutshell, this service allows me to share my availability and leave it to the other party / parties to pick a date and time that’s convenient for them. This completely takes away all of the ugly back-and-forth! And on top of that, it allows the other party to choose very freely and conveniently. This has freed up hours of my time that I can now use for more important work!</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>It’s hard to put a concrete dollar value to the above benefits. But if you think <em>any</em> of them through, you will quickly see that many software tools are a true bargain – they make you more productive, allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them, reduce mistakes, and free your time for more important work. All of this makes for a terribly great return on investment!</p>



<h2>Common Objections</h2>



<p>Let’s not ignore the haters, doubters, and nay-sayers and address some common objections.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s too expensive!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s take our own tool, the “Tower” Git GUI, as an example.</p>



<ul><li>A license costs between 69 and 99 USD per user per year.</li><li>Our customers are professional software developers in companies large and small as well as freelance programmers.</li><li>The value that Tower delivers is that it makes software developers more productive: it helps them reduce mistakes and get access to the more advanced features that allow them to produce higher-quality software.</li></ul>



<p>The average software developer’s salary varies wildly, but it’s somewhere between 40,000 and 150,000 USD per year. The math here is very simple: if such a tool can help a developer save just <em>a couple of minutes</em> or prevent <em>just 1-2 errors</em> every month – by adding a meager 69 USD to that 40,000 USD yearly cost – the software tool has already paid for itself!</p>



<p>The same argument holds true for almost <em>any</em> knowledge worker: compared to the salaries of well-educated people, the costs of most software tools are extremely low, almost negligible. This means that they earn back their money very quickly! Either in productivity or any of the other benefits that I mentioned above.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t need a tool for that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s true: you <em>can</em> skin a potato with your bare hands and fingernails. But it’s just not very efficient. One reason why humankind has flourished over the millennia is because we have the ability to invent tools. And a potato peeler isn’t very different from a software tool like Tower: you’ll be more productive and get a better end result when using it!</p>



<p>I don’t doubt that you <em>can</em> do lots of things manually, without using a tool. But think carefully if, at least in some cases, there’s a chance that a tool could make things <em>easier</em> and <em>more productive</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The free alternative is sufficient for me.”</p></blockquote>



<p>While you usually have to <em>pay</em> for a potato peeler, software tools are <em>sometimes</em> free: they might be Open Source, or a programmer’s hobby project, or they’re sponsored by a large corporation.</p>



<p>In some cases, such a free piece of software might indeed be an excellent choice (very often the case with Open Source projects). But more often than not, “free” will come with a price tag. Let’s take <strong>quality</strong> as an example: often, quality is not on par with paid alternatives. Why? Because quality costs an immense amount of time and money which both have to come from somewhere! Other examples are non-existent customer support or the lack of good documentation. All of these things, just like the overall “quality” aspect, cost time and money which are often not available in the case of free software.</p>



<blockquote><p>“My boss won’t pay for this.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dear managers: I hope that reading this far has convinced you that it makes a ton of sense to cover expenses for software tools. If they make your employees just a tiny bit more productive – or if they make their lives a little bit easier – then covering expenses for tools should be a no-brainer. After all, <strong>our job as managers is to provide the people in our teams with everything they need to do good, productive work</strong>.</p>



<h2>A Look at Our Own “Household Spending”</h2>



<p>I started this post by admitting that I’m terribly biased: as CEO of a small software company, it’s probably no surprise that I encourage people to buy <em>our</em> software. However, I’m quite confident that I went beyond <em>our own</em> product and proved that the ROI of software tools <em>in general</em> is often very good.</p>



<p>To prove that we really “walk the walk” (and not just “talk the talk”), here’s an overview of the tools that we spend our own, hard-earned money on:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="1024" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png 686w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-201x300.png 201w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-768x1146.png 768w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"><figcaption>Software Tools Overtable</figcaption></figure>



<h2>It Goes Without Saying: Spend Wisely!</h2>



<p>Of course, all of the above does NOT mean that you should just spend, spend, spend! 💵 Like in other areas of life, you shouldn’t give in to every impulse and just buy any software tool that you come across.</p>



<p>But when it comes to <em>tools for your work</em>, I encourage you to keep your eyes just as much on the “return” part as on the “investment” of the “Return on Investment” consideration. <strong>Don’t hesitate to buy software that brings value!</strong> If it helps you and your team do your jobs better – in a more productive, easier, or safer way – then investing is probably much more clever than being overly frugal.</p>

<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><blockquote>No, thank you. I can't work with you on your project. I prefer to dedicate my time on my own creative projects. Not that I don't find your project interesting, I know that focusing on my own business will make me happier in the long term. So I'm not taking any new clients. I would suggest you talk to my competent friends X or Y. I can set up an intro if you want.<br>I wish you the best,<p>- A courageous freelancer</p></blockquote><p>The opportunity costs calculations at play in this message: a missed short term gain but a rewarding long term choice.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>The two years mark</strong></h2><p>If someone is still freelancing after two years, they've passed a filter: they're good enough for new clients to come naturally, they like it enough to keep going, haven't burned out and they charge enough to make a living. In my experience, two years also marks a change of mindset: freelancers start refusing new work.</p><p>‍</p><h2>When to say yes</h2><p>Not so fast, cowboy. There are many reasons why getting new client work is a smart decision. It pays well. You build up a portfolio. You expand and accrue the benefits of a larger network. You practice what you learn. You gain authority. And you find more problems that you can solve through education or products (see the <a href="https://www.supercreative.design/blog/hyper-freelance" target="_blank">hyper freelance</a> model).</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Earning more because you care less</strong></h2><p>Here's the counterintuitive (and frankly irritating) thing that happens after the two years mark: someone pitches you a new project but you're not <em>really</em> interested.<br>So you increase your prices.<br>But the client accepts.<br>Wait. What?<br>People are willing to pay that price?<br>So you keep on charging more again. And that's how many freelancers stumble into the wonderful world of high prices™️, myself included. The less you want a new client, the more attractive you'll be, the higher you'll get paid.</p><figure id="w-node-5c826a3bcca3-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fbe7a040059199dbc8c730c_Formula%20stop%20clients.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Saying no formula"></p></figure><p>The less you care, the more you're paid. When we let this idea suck in, it becomes in our best interest to diversify our businesses, create optionality and practice saying no more often.</p><p>‍</p><h2>When to say no</h2><p>Given the inherent inconsistency and variability of client work, accepting new projects is reassuring. But choosing to say yes or no to a new client is working with many unknowns: if they will pay, if they'll like the work, if <em>you</em>'ll like working with them, if you have the right skills, if they'll come back...</p><p>Accepting new clients is accumulating worries. It's deliberately accepting new weight on your cognitive load, highjacking your mental space. More emails to answer, documents to prepare, relationships to nurture. And at some point, the marginal mental cost of accepting a new client gets bigger than the financial benefit.</p><figure id="w-node-9d4735e89978-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fbe9d86f7f81f2049cc1226_Accepting%20new%20clients%20threshold%20graph.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>David C. Baker says it best in his book <a href="https://www.davidcbaker.com/book-the-business-of-expertise" target="_blank"><em>The Business of Expertise</em></a>, saying no is how we position ourselves. It's how we double down on what we want. So if we want to become successful freelancers, saying no is a requirement.</p><p>It comes down to trading time to financial freedom. There's a point where trading time for money becomes sub-optimal. Since we have to start over for every new client, this doesn't look like wealth compounding to me, right <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?lang=en" target="_blank">Naval</a>?</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>How to say no</strong></h2><p>Once we've reached the "<em>No" </em>threshold, we can still benefit from our reputation. Here are some options:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Giving back to a collective</strong>: By setting up or joining a collective, we can redirect projects to a network of freelancers. Easy to join, valuable in the long term but no financial upside.</li><li><strong>Delegating work</strong>: Hiring someone else to delegate the extra work we're not excited about is possible too. This isn't easy because our reputation is still on the line and we have to manage someone else. It's pretty common to see successful freelancers turn into mini agencies, just taking a percentage % for all projects and delegating to their own constellation of freelancer friends. That's the hard and risky option with high financial upside.</li><li><strong>Productizing our offer</strong>: Offering a fixed package in a fixed time scope instead. See my <a href="https://www.supercreative.design/helpline" target="_blank">Creative Helpline</a> offer as an example: two hours long consulting calls. When the call is over, my worries are too. That's one of the best option as we retain some of the benefits of consulting while living our professional life in our own terms.</li><li><strong>Redirecting to courses</strong>: When the clients wants the fish, explaining that learning how to fish is more better and actually possible with our own course, then that's a win-win situation. That does entail creating an educational product or course beforehand. But I can tell you from experience, it's awesome to turn a potential client into a student.</li><li><strong>Just saying no</strong>: The fastest option. Saying no to new client work takes courage: courage to face financial pressure, client dissatisfaction and believing in a better future. Upfront, quick and warm answers to potential clients might be the best thing for us and for them.<br>Baby, it's not you,<em> it's me.</em></li></ul><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-ebd764d8e8fa-8ff50e46"><a href="https://www.supercreative.design/helpline" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fbe7a25796bc010303e1fde_helpline%20no%20thank%20you.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Creative Helpline Supercreative"></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h2>COVID wakeup call</h2><p>The worldwide pandemic shattered a lot of client contracts. Get too attached to a big profitable client and we might in fact weaken our business (if you like that idea, read <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile" target="_blank"><em>Antifragile</em></a>). For many freelancers, this might have been the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-a-covid-19-lockdown-inspired-me-to-start-my-business-and-grow-it-22027589ad" target="_blank">wakeup call</a>. Not to blindly accept new work, but rather to consider new revenue streams. I know it was mine: I stopped taking clients and redirected all proposals to my <a href="https://www.supercreative.design/helpline" target="_blank">Creative Helpline</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>For my French compatriots, this article was inspired by Cyrano. Here's the <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/9502587-The-Tirade-of-Non--merci--from-Cyrano-de-Bergerac-by-LunaLovegood" target="_blank">English translation</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-f33a798d6909-8ff50e46"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_6VCPhDTIE"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This is the curse of freelancing: we're free to accept the clients whom we'll be slave to afterward. We need to carefully and regularly look after and nurture our freelance freedom. <br>We're just a client away from captivity.</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>‍</p></article></div>]]>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>As we are talking about an image <i>file</i>, it comes natural to store it on the traditional <b>filesystem</b>. Unfortunately, traditional filesystems don't support transactions. Getting the security aspects right is hard. It's a challenge to make consistent backups given that you can't just stop the world. Inevitably, a traditional filesystem will be modified while you are working on the backup. Sooner or later this will cause problems.</p><p><b>Databases</b> can solve all of the above. They have transactions. If you do a backup, it will likely be consistent by default. The problem is, databases are bad with large objects. They are a bad choice if you want to serve lots of users.</p><p>This is really frustrating. Why can't we have a storage system that combines the best of both worlds?</p><p>I want this:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The problem space is cut along the wrong dimensions</h2><p>Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. This is how the problem space for storing data is currently divided:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Eliminating global data</h3><p>We have addressed how to have a hierarchy of objects everywhere, even on the dynamic filesystem but if we store it as a separate filesystem tree, we are back to square one: a global shared namespace. Instead, what we need is the ability to <i>attach</i> dynamic volumes anywhere on the static filesystem, like so:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=cb5a4070bc6&amp;width=1024" alt="Dynamic volumes attached to the Static Filesystem"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-21"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The <i>existence</i> of these dynamic volumes must be version controlled but their contents must not be as they are constantly changing. They must be somehow stored on the dynamic filesystem instead.</p><p>Let's see an <b>example</b>. Imagine a comments element embedded into a page. It shall have its own dynamic volume with its own schema. The existence of the comments element must be version controlled but not the actual comments. They can't be: they would cause continuous merging issues.</p><p>Removing either the comments element itself (or even the page it is embedded in) must remove the comments element itself with all associated user comments. In the traditional setup, you would have to write lots of code yourself to figure out what data needs to be removed. This takes time (money) and may be non-trivial when there are several 3rd party plugins installed. With proper encapsulation, the system can automatically do this for you.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><div><p>So here is how this works. Boomla files have a <i>link</i> property. You can attach a dynamic volume anywhere on your website's filesystem by simply setting the file's link property to <code>dynamic</code>.</p></div></div>

</div></div>

<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-25"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>By doing so, the system will create a new volume on the hidden dynamic filesystem and map it to the linking file. (Using the linking file's file ID.) From that point on, you will be able to write the dynamic subtree as usual. It will appear as if it was part of your website's filesystem tree.</p><p>That way, in Boomla, deleting the page holding the comments will <i>also remove the actual comments</i>.</p><p>The root volume of the dynamic filesystem is hidden by design, it's not directly accessible. If you are interested, see the <a href="https://boomla.com/docs/how-it-works/anatomy-of-the-boomla-filesystem/file-link/dynamic-link">dynamic link docs</a> for more details.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Undo, redo</h2><p>One of the really powerful features of the Boomla Filesystem is that undo/redo is available for the entire website. It <i>makes</i> us experiment. We can try things, we can fail and we can always undo. It's a huge boost to <i>dare to try</i>.</p><p>The great news is, <b>undo/redo will still be available</b> when collaboration is enabled.</p><p>There is a little caveat though. In the <b>production environment</b> you may have multiple users making changes. You definitely don't want to accidentally undo a comment or an order made by someone else. Plus in production, the static filesystem is read-only as you probably don't want your visitors to see your work-in-progress. Because of this, undo/redo is not available in the production environment (master branch).</p><p>Once you clone the production environment and thus create a <b>development branch</b>, undo/redo will be available for your entire website. Changes made to the static and dynamic filesystems are bundled in a single atomic transaction, creating a single undo point. That way, whatever changes you make, you will be able to use undo/redo.</p><p>To rephrase, you either don't have undo/redo at all (master branch) or you have undo/redo for your entire website (secondary branches).</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Users, Access Control, Security</h2><p>Using a traditional filesystem and database poses another problem with access control.</p><p><b>Access control can only be enforced in a layer that has access to both users and data.</b> It's just impossible otherwise. Websites and web apps introduce their own user concepts. As a result, they should take over all access control responsibilities. Data access should only happen through a single, well defined layer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Both databases and the underlying OS have their own user concepts with their own means of doing access control. Plus your chosen CMS or framework has its own user concept and access control mechanisms. Application developers have access to all of them. They have to call all the right functions themselves to make sure everything is secure. Every application developer has to be a security expert and not make mistakes.</p><p>If you are wondering how this could possibly be secure - don't worry, it isn't. <b>It's a complete disaster.</b> (Pro tip: make your competitors use this.)</p></div>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

<p>There’s a fantastic article from last year titled <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, don’t validate</a>. I’d highly recommend it to any programmer (along with the more recent follow up <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">Names are not type safety</a>). The basic idea is that there are two ways to check that some input to a function is valid:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>validator</em> checks that the input is valid and throws an error if not. It doesn’t return anything. For example, checking that a list is not empty. </li><li>A <em>parser</em> does the same as a validator, but returns a more specific representation of the input that ensures that the required property is satisfied. For example, checking that a list is not empty and <em>returning a NonEmptyList type</em>. </li></ul>



<p>The thesis of the article is that parsers are preferable to validators. If you’ve not read the original article, please do so – it’s very well written and makes the case much better than I can summarise it. The essential message is to <em>make illegal states unrepresentable</em>. In the article, this is done by making use of the type system. This is a philosophy I entirely agree with, but I want to point out and expand upon one ironic aspect of the argument:</p>



<p><strong><em>A type checker is a paradigmatic example of a validator!</em></strong></p>



<p>A type checker, after all, takes as input an already parsed program representation and rejects it if it fails to type-check. It doesn’t return a more specific representation of the program. (Not to be confused with <em>type inference</em>, which does return more information, but only about the types). </p>



<p>So what would be the parser alternative to a type checker in a programming language? One approach would be to actually create a more specific grammar that eliminates illegal states. For example, if a given function requires a number that must be between one and five, then rather than having a generic syntax for function calls such as:</p>



<pre>fun_call ::= fun_name ‘(‘ integer ‘)’</pre>



<p>You would instead define specific grammar rules for the functions you provide:</p>



<pre>one_to_five ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5<br>fun_call ::= ‘lil_fac(‘ one_to_five ‘)’<br>         | ... other function definitions ...</pre>



<p>Creating such specific grammars is one approach to crafting <em><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">domain-specific languages</a> </em>(DSLs). And indeed, DSLs are a great way of ensuring that illegal states aren’t representable. Of course, this is not a scalable solution if you want to make a general-purpose language with user-defined functions.</p>



<p>An alternative to having a very specific grammar is to instead <em>raise the level of abstraction</em>, so that it is easier to avoid invalid states. For example, a common source of programming errors is out of bounds indexing into arrays. This occurs because the programming language only offers a primitive indexing operation: <code>a[x]</code>. Here “x” is an integer but might be out of bounds, resulting in an exception or crash (if you’re lucky). One way we could prevent this would be to define a more specific type of “integers between zero and 12” so that the type system rejects any potentially invalid indexing operations, and then track this more precise type for each array — validation again. </p>



<p>A different approach would be to notice that there are typically a few common ways that you want to use an array and provide specific abstractions in the language that capture those uses. For example, it’s very common to want to iterate through the array performing some kind of calculation. Rather than making everyone manually write out the for-loops for doing this — do arrays in this language start at 0 or 1? Do they stop at array.length or array.length – 1? Do array indexes have a specific type? — you could instead offer a general <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">fold </a>(reduce) operation. Likewise, instead of making people write their own hashtables you could provide one built-in to the language itself. By providing better abstractions you make it less likely that programmers will hit illegal states. </p>



<p>You can then go further and <em>remove</em> the more primitive operations, only allowing access to the higher level abstractions. Hopefully in 2020 most programmers would agree that removing goto statements in favour of higher level structured programming abstractions was a win, and the same can be true of other low-level constructs: nulls, raw memory pointers, etc. </p>



<p>In the world of computer security, there is a direct analogue of this discussion. The security model of most computer systems allows a separation between operations I <em>can</em> (try to) perform and operations I am <em>allowed</em> to perform: I can try and delete your website, but (hopefully) the request will be rejected as unauthorized. In contrast, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability systems</a> my ability to even invoke such an operation depends upon me holding an unforgeable c<em>apability </em>granting me permission to perform it. It’s not possible to even attempt an operation that I am not allowed to perform. For example, in a REST API using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2019/01/16/can-you-ever-safely-include-credentials-in-a-url/">capability URIs</a>, I cannot simply send a DELETE request to /users/alice, but instead need to send it to some unguessable random URI – if I don’t already have that URI then I can’t even begin to send the request. Object-capability security therefore aims to make <em>unauthorized states unrepresentable</em>. </p>



<p>Perhaps the most widely known embodiment of the object-capability paradigm is the <a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>: a <em>dynamically-typed</em> object-oriented programming language. Although now somewhat abandoned, it is a fascinating language with a lot of great ideas. E uses strong abstraction boundaries to ensure security. Be warned: the E website is a rabbit hole of incredible depth!</p>



<p>In my twenties, I used to do a lot of programming in <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a>. A language that most would agree is about as far removed from a modern statically typed programming language as you can get. (Often pointed out with something close to utter disgust). And yet the idea of making illegal states unrepresentable was entirely natural to myself and other Tcl programmers. I would frequently start a programming project by creating a <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/interp.htm#M12">blank-slate interpreter</a>, stripping out all the built-in language constructs (<a href="http://nsl.com/">loops</a>, procedures, even <a href="https://tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/expr.htm">arithmetic</a>), and then adding back in a carefully selected set of high-level domain-specific primitives. This DSL would then become the application’s configuration file, safe in the knowledge that illegal configurations cannot be expressed. </p>



<p>To summarise, my point is not that type systems are bad or that the original essay is flawed. On the contrary, I thank the flying spaghetti monster almost every day for the type system in my day job (and that is only Java’s tepid concoction), and I think the “parse, don’t validate” essay is excellent. But the last two decades have seen such advances in type systems and the adoption of typeful programming patterns that we are in danger of thinking that type systems are the only way of achieving correctness in software construction. They are a tremendously powerful tool, but more basic techniques of abstraction and information hiding can be just as powerful. The goal of making illegal states unrepresentable should be one of the defining goals of software engineering, but there are many valid ways to crack that nut.</p>



<p><em>Shameless plug: I discuss capability URIs in depth in chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">my book on API security</a>, just published by Manning. I also discuss using types to enforce security properties in chapter 6. </em></p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>I received an email from a developer not long ago. She introduced herself and asked me if her knowledge was sufficient to become, and I quote, “a real developer”. I have received this exact email from so many different people that I am actually writing an article about it.</p>



<h3>A true developer</h3>



<p>Today we’re going to talk about the idea that some developers would be more developers than others.</p>



<p>It’s something that comes up all the time with the more junior developers. <strong>It’s something that concerns all developers.</strong></p>



<p>When you want to be part of a group, or a community more generally, you need to follow some rules and customs. There’s no escaping that. With tech, it’s obviously the same thing.</p>



<p>And for us, it translates into things like: “a real developer does C++”, or “a real developer never uses his mouse”, “a real developer spends all his free time on leetcode”, and other bullshit just like that.</p>



<p>I’ll spare you all the other examples, I’ve really read and heard everything.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you call yourself a developer and use a mouse for editing code, I just assume you are a junior.</p>— 🅾️shell (@_oshell) <a href="https://twitter.com/_oshell/status/1312206331277840384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On a senior developer all this has less effect. At worst, it could make you angry and you could start to slap people with your keyboard.</p>



<p><strong>On a junior developer, it’s catastrophic.</strong> Because while you’re building your skills and your vision of the job, you’re being harassed. Permanent questioning that makes no sense at all.</p>



<p>Confidence takes a hit and the ability to learn with it. Most of the time, just to please one person.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_5883926f.jpg" data-src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_5883926f.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>And the tragedy begins when you learn things out of social pressure, not desire. </strong>It’s a never-ending story.</p>



<h3>The never-ending story</h3>



<p>I’ve been there. Like many people, I started with HTML/CSS/Javascript. <strong>The Holy Trinity of the world wide web.</strong></p>



<p>Very quickly, people told me that I wasn’t doing any real development.<strong> I wasn’t a real one</strong>. At best, I was a word processor.</p>



<p>A real developer makes real code, you know? A real language with objects, classes and all that goes with it. So I learned PHP.</p>



<p>And when you’re a PHP developer but you’re not a killer in a framework, it’s weird. People look at you as if you’ve just landed with your flying saucer. <strong>So Symfony became <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/religion-among-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my religion</a>.</strong> </p>



<p>And then, people told that when you’re web developer, you’re not really a developer. <strong>You only make websites, it’s not complicated.</strong></p>



<p>So I learned Python. And then I was told that Python is too easy. <strong>To be a real developer, you have to wait for a more complex language like C++</strong>. So I learned C++ by trying to code a video game on Unreal Engine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RkeV4V6.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/RkeV4V6.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>And I continued like that for years, from tool to tool and new knowledge to new knowledge. I remember losing all hope with some medium Leetcode questions. <strong>Am I really cut out for this job?</strong></p>



<p>Finally I came to understand that there was no end to it. I came to understand that it was only a problem in my head. A problem of elitism.</p>



<h3>Understanding elitism in 30 seconds</h3>



<p>Elitism exists everywhere. It’s not something that is unique to developers. <strong>That said, it is strongly present in our profession.</strong> And actually, it’s very logical.</p>



<p><strong>Development is a very complicated job.</strong> Anyone who thinks the opposite have an <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/the-unbelievable-developers-ego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ego problem</a>. And when this complexity is “mastered”, especially with certain tools or certain ways of doing things, that’s when elitism appears.</p>



<p>What must be understood is that people who impose their elitism and their way of doing things as absolute truth do not do so without reason. They are people who have fought to reach their level of knowledge. <strong>Complex professions have this effect on people.</strong></p>



<p>Development is no exception.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-endings-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-endings-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>As long as you haven’t struggled as much as they have, on subjects as complex as they have, you won’t be a “real” developer.</p>



<p>I hate that kind of attitude, but it’s human to react like that.<strong> I’ve caught myself having this kind of attitude before.</strong> Of course, in a teddy bear version of it. I’m not completely stupid.</p>



<p>But despite all my good will and hindsight, sometimes it happens.</p>



<h3>You are a developer</h3>



<p>Let’s be clear.</p>



<ul><li>If you make code, you’re a developer.</li><li>If you make code and get paid for it, you are a professional developer.<br></li></ul>



<p>What I want you to understand today is that both of these facts are true. And it doesn’t matter, your language, your tools and your level of knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.</strong></p>



<p>You are not a “fake developer”. It doesn’t exist.</p>



<p>But I know that feeling is strong at the beginning of your career. With time and experience, some of that feeling will disappear.</p>



<p>I’m not going to lie to you either. It’s never going to completely disappear. <strong>I don’t want to talk about the impostor syndrome today, because it’s a subject in itself.</strong> We’ll come back to it in a future article.</p>



<p>All I want you to understand today is that elitism is the basis of all this. <strong>People who do not hesitate to denigrate others just to prove things to themselves.</strong> And sometimes it takes on ridiculous proportions.</p>



<p>You’d be surprised how many devs are completely questioned when they change jobs or teams. <strong>It’s common and completely normal.</strong> Usually it puts the elitism back in place.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img2.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-did-caleb-have-to-die-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img2.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-did-caleb-have-to-die-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Despite all these years of experience, nothing is fixed and absolute.</strong> The developers’ level is a long gray scale that moves constantly.</p>



<p>Not everything is black or white. There are also Arabs, Chinese, and people who think they are helping, but who only make things worse. </p>



<p><strong>Anyway, if your goal is to be more waterproof and feel better as a developer, there are two very simple things you can do right now.</strong></p>



<p>To feel better as a developer, I think you have to be pragmatic in the way you approach and do this job. And take the time to build knowledge with practice.</p>



<h3>The Pragmatic Programmer</h3>



<p>I remember the first thing that completely freaked me out as a junior was how much knowledge the other developers had around me. Especially in terms of best practices, code organization philosophy and general rules to make quality.</p>



<p>I always felt so overwhelmed. It seemed insurmountable. And in fact, if I hadn’t done anything, I was going to stay in the same situation.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-us-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-us-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Then one day I came across the book <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/338I2Tl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></strong>. It was by far the book that gave me the most confidence in myself and my abilities. It obviously talks about technique, but not only that.</p>



<p>This book taught me the pragmatic approach of being a developer. And I apply advices from this book every day. <strong>It has calmed my anxieties towards my code, towards others, and especially towards myself.</strong></p>



<p>It taught me the principle of entropy in development. It’s responsible for most of the rotten codebase. He taught me how to talk requirements with a client. He taught me how to debug efficiently. He taught me how to solve “impossible” problems in my code. He taught me how to communicate with other developers efficiently. He taught me how to give feedback and especially how to receive negative feedback.</p>



<p><a href="https://amzn.to/338I2Tl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Pragmatic Programmer</strong></a> is responsible for the confidence I have as a developer. And I recommend it to all developers, regardless of your level.</p>



<p>But all this is nothing without practice.</p>



<h3>Practice</h3>



<p>I could give you all the tips in the world to feel better as a developer, it won’t help if you don’t practice on your own.</p>



<p>And normally, I’m supposed to give you a list of side projects to do. Complete subjects, that make you touch everything. <strong>Boring topics that you’ll never finish before you shoot yourself in the head because of boredom.</strong> Believe me, it’s not going to help you learn anything.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-is-it-called-ex-machina-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-is-it-called-ex-machina-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>I know this because, once again, have been there. And my advice is very simple. <strong>Do a project on a subject that really interests you.</strong> No matter how useful it is, no matter what language you use, no matter what concept you working with.</p>



<p><strong>If you do something you hate, you won’t finish it.</strong></p>



<p>How to come up with an idea then ? How do you motivate yourself? How do you find time? <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/side-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I answer all this in the article dedicated to custom projects</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/side-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A personal project is not a chore</a>. It’s by replacing the notion of chore by fun that you will do a lot of practice. <strong>And practice is the ultimate key to more confidence as a developer.</strong></p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>No developer is “more” developer than others. No matter what language or tools you use. People who think otherwise, you can simply ignore them. This will allow you to focus on yourself. And that’s all that counts for more confidence in what you do.</p>

<p>Who’s got two thumbs and shipped her first of <a href="https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/">12 startups in 12 months</a> <em>on schedule</em>? That’s right, this girl.</p>

<p>In its first week, the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 reached $5K in revenue through
a combination of lifetime deals, subscriptions, and my first ever Bitcoin transaction (thanks, Nico!).</p>

<p>A profitable first week isn’t what makes this a success in my book.</p>

<p>I’m <em>thrilled</em> at all the cool members who decided to join.
Exactly as I’d hoped, each person adds something unique and interesting to the community,
and I’m really excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my first monthly retrospective.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be sharing a behind-the-scenes look at the first week of my paid community launch
and reveal what I’m shipping in November.</p>

<p>Below you’ll discover charts, graphs, screenshots, strategy, reflections, and my master plan
for growing Blogging for Devs through viral, generated content 🔮</p>

<p>I promise, it’s good.</p>



<p>First question: Did I really?</p>

<p>Before talking about what I’ve been up to in October, it’s important to
get on the same page about this:</p>

<p><strong>Even though I began charging to join the community this month, the community
itself was launched as a sort of “closed beta” back in July.</strong></p>

<p>The newsletter that helped me connect with first 100 free members (and most of the
paid members — more on that later) was launched in May.</p>

<p>You know what they say about overnight success.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s what and how I launched in a month.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-community-preview-image.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Pro Community"></p>

<p><a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 is a paid
community for developers, makers, engineering managers, and technical founders to grow their blogs
through feedback, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>We have accountability groups, virtual events and workshops, members-only resources and original content,
and most importantly — super kind and knowledgeable members.</p>

<p>For the first 250 people to join, it costs $12/month, $96/year, or $180 once.</p>

<p>The discussions are powered by <a href="http://circle.so/" alt="Circle (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Circle</a>
 and rocking
a custom theme I hacked together through highly specific CSS selectors and
vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/circle-code-snippets.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they say you only need to know React these days 😝</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It integrates with the Gatsby website through a custom OAuth provider, which uses Firebase
for authentication. It’s all serverless and cloud native and such.</p>

<p>In October, I built Events, a member RSS feed, signup, payment, the landing page, onboarding, profiles, welcome email sequence,
and a lean batch of starter content. I designed everything myself in Figma. For more granular detail on building the product,
you can see the day-to-day in my <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1315678202988244993" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>Enough about tech, let’s talk launch.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-pro-screenshot-2.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community"></p>

<h2 id="success-metrics-why-you-won-t-find-an-overall-conversion-rate-in-this-report">Success metrics: Why you won’t find an overall conversion rate in this report</h2>

<p>My real goal for the community was to get
great people in, and not to overly optimize for converting anyone with a pulse.</p>

<p>That’s why my biggest launch fear wasn’t that no one would sign up.</p>

<p>It was that people I <em>don’t like</em> would sign up. Spammers, self-promoters, attention-seekers,
jerks.
Thankfully it hasn’t been the case and everyone is awesome so far 🤞</p>

<p>I try to scare those types away with a prominent Code of Conduct and an “Is this right for you?” checklist.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-checklist.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<p>That’s why I have no idea what my “conversion rate” for the community is and I don’t actually care.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> pay attention to the opt-in rate for my free newsletter, though, so don’t take this as, “Girl doesn’t care about metrics.”</p>

<p>I care about metrics, just <em>not</em> on the community landing page.</p>

<p>The reason is, joining a community is a long-term thing.
Something like this often takes time and multiple exposures for people
to make the decision — it was the same for me and <a href="https://rosie.land/" alt="Rosieland (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Rosieland</a>
 and <a href="http://trends.co/" target="_blank">Trends</a>.</p>

<p>The more interesting question is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I can I learn about the members who did sign up, so I can find more people like them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, it’s chart time 👯‍♀️</p>



<p>Were paying members wooed by my slick landing page, or convinced by
a carefully crafted tweet?</p>

<p>Turns out, probably not.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-members.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Member Attribution"></p>

<p>Most new members were already subscribed to <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank">my free weekly newsletter</a> about blogging for developers, which is about 4,000 subscribers strong.</p>

<p>Every Friday for nearly six months, I’ve been sending out original content about
blogging, SEO, going viral, attracting an audience, and a splash of motivational moments. It takes me an entire day to write.</p>

<p>Out of 69 new paying members in the first week, <strong>only three were
unattributable</strong> at least one of three sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Waitlister</li>
<li>Newsletter Subscriber</li>
<li>Twitter Follower</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-channels.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Paid Community Launch Channels"></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Newsletter backstory:</strong> I started the newsletter in May, and it’s since grown to over 4,000 subscribers. If you want to know how, check out the writeups I’ve done <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/launch-a-newsletter/" alt="here (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">here</a>
 and <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/product-hunt-launch/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people had multiple touchpoints: subscriber <em>and</em> on the waitlist, or followed me on twitter
<em>and</em> subscriber to the newsletter.</p>

<p>However, only <strong>31% of new members follow me on Twitter</strong>. I’m not offended, to the contrary —
I prefer it.</p>

<p>Now I know that if I want to grow the community, the best thing I can do
is have more of the right people <strong>join the newsletter first</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why my goal is to grow the newsletter, and trust that the community
will eventually benefit from the best subscribers joining up.</p>

<p>Let’s take a dip into revenue for a second.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-and-where-did-revenue-come-from">How much and where did revenue come from?</h2>

<p>As I said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1325008065041666049" alt="tweet (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">tweet</a>
 where I collected ideas for this article, the $5K revenue is <em>not</em> MRR (monthly recurring revenue).</p>

<p>MRR for the Blogging for Devs Community is just $516 according to Stripe.</p>

<p>So where did the first week’s $5K in revenue come from?</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-revenue.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Revenue"></p>

<p>Someone on Twitter recently asked me if I have any “thought leadership”
to spare on the topic of <strong>lifetime pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t.</p>

<p>Guess what, I’m neither optimizing for conversion nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" alt="LTV (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">LTV</a>
 🙃</p>

<p>Offering a lifetime price at a lower cost than 2 years as a member is
really just a way for me to say “Thank you” to people who are in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>I see it as a mutual commitment.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable-yet">Is this sustainable yet?</h2>

<p>You might see $5K in a week and think it sounds like a lot of money. If only one
could extrapolate that to $20k/mo, then I’d be set.</p>

<p>But of course, it’s not the whole picture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taxes and healthcare are super expensive here in Germany</li>
<li>I already spend over $300/mo on SaaS tools to run the community</li>
<li>Only $500 currently recurs monthly, assuming zero growth/churn</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, I have a <strong><em>very</em> long way to go</strong> before the community is sustainable.</p>

<p>That’s why my November startup is a side project to scale reach of the newsletter,
which should <em>in turn</em> drive the growth of the community.</p>

<p>I think marketers would call this a “funnel”.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-funnel.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Funnel"></p>

<p>I think about it a little more like concentric circles approaching a core.</p>

<p>My next task is to expand the outermost ring with the kind of people who are
likely to join and enjoy the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="my-master-plan-for-growing-blogging-for-devs-beyond-twitter-and-word-of-mouth">My master plan for growing Blogging for Devs beyond Twitter and word of mouth</h2>

<p>Channels die. Or at least, they become exhausted.</p>

<p>Although people still write me emails saying they’ve been following for
years, and just found out I have a newsletter — most of that is probably in the past.</p>

<p>People who know me, know about Blogging for Devs.</p>

<p>I really don’t want to spend all day on Twitter “growing my social media presence”.
I’d rather be building cool shit and helping other people build cool shit, too.
Let people find me through that.</p>

<p>Right now, word of mouth is what grows the newsletter.</p>

<p>Random mentions and links.  I find out through welcome emails or through
stalking my backlink reports from time to time.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/newsletter-replies.png" alt="Lala"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do reply to everyone who emails me, but I was running a bit behind
after spending the prior week following the US election 🙈</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On average, I gain about 5-10 subscribers per day.</p>

<p>A prominent mention on Twitter, Indie Hackers, or the success of a subscriber’s
blog post can push than number over 100.</p>

<p><strong>The problem? Today, word of mouth isn’t sufficient to grow the newsletter quickly enough to reach sustainability in the near term.</strong></p>

<p>Ironically, I’m also a blogger with no spare time to grow it writing a ton of individual blog posts 😅</p>

<p>So how can I grow my newsletter about blogging, without blogging <em>myself</em>,
and without relying on Twitter for all my traffic?</p>

<p>Here comes the master plan. I hope it works.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-ll-build-traffic-to-blogging-for-devs-while-writing-virtually-no-blog-posts">How I’ll build traffic to Blogging for Devs (while writing virtually no blog posts)</h2>

<p>I have a theory. Well, I have a few theories.</p>

<p>The first one is this: Developers want to discover blogs written by other developers.
Reading company engineering blogs is fine, but quality content from their peers or individuals
they admire is far more interesting.</p>

<p>Most places to discover developer content feature individual articles. Hacker
News, Reddit, and Twitter all fundamentally work this way.</p>

<p>But what’s more interesting is the person behind the blog. Their personality, what makes them unique,
inspiring, and worth following in their own right.</p>

<p>To back this up, I present Exhibit A.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Tech Twitter:</p><p>What is your NUMBER ONE favorite blog by someone in tech, who has a <em>distinct writing style</em>? Where you read their articles for their <em>unique personality or voice</em>?</p><p>(Pls no list of twitter handles, direct link to the blog is 👍)</p></div>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1299054522074005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Apart from the fact that asking for any kind of recommendation on Twitter is a
one-way ticket to pandemonium, you can tell from the replies that
people feel strongly about the topic. 400+ responses.</p>

<p>When I build something, I like that the topic evokes a response like this.</p>

<p><strong>It means people care.</strong></p>

<p>Extension of the theory (this time with less evidence): Many people who read
amazing tech blogs also aspire to create one themselves.</p>

<p>Ergo, if I create a place for people to discover the best developer blogs,
there’s a good chance people who show up will like my newsletter, too.</p>

<p>So here’s my plan.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/bfd-rankings-social-preview.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Trends"></p>

<h4>Jeff Bezos Quotes</h4>



<p>Here are the most powerful success lessons from the Jeff Bezos inspirational quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think. Whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.</p><cite><strong> Jeff Bezos </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you never want to be criticized, for goodness’ sake don’t do anything new.</p><cite> <strong> Jeff Bezos </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Maintain a firm grasp of the obvious at all times.</p><cite><strong>Jeff Bezos </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments too soon. And if you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall and you won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re trying to solve.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>In the old world, you devoted 30% of your time to building a great service and 70% of your time to shouting about it. In the new world, that inverts.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation. That’s approaching evil.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The death knell for any enterprise is to glorify the past — no matter how good it was.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>When you receive criticism from well-meaning people, it pays to ask, ‘Are they right?’ And if they are, you need to adapt what they’re doing. If they’re not right, if you really have conviction that they’re not right, you need to have that long-term willingness to be misunderstood. It’s a key part of invention.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you decide that you’re going to do only the things you know are going to work, you’re going to leave a lot of opportunity on the table.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>What consumerism really is, at its worst is getting people to buy things that don’t actually improve their lives.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Cultures aren’t so much planned as they evolve from that early set of people.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>As a company, one of our greatest cultural strengths is accepting the fact that if you’re going to invent, you’re going to disrupt.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Start With the Customer and Work Backward</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Post is famous for its investigative journalism. It pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of websites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can’t, it’s difficult to put the right resources behind it. … Even behind a paywall, websites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, ‘Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free from another site?</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Position yourself with something that captures your curiosity, something that you’re missionary about.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You collect as much data as you can, you immerse yourself in that data but then you make the decision with your heart.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I’d rather interview fifty people and not hire anyone than hire the wrong person.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I knew that if I <a href="https://motiveex.com/tag/failure/">failed</a> I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The missionary is building the product and building the service because they love the customer, because they love the product, because they love the service. The mercenary is building the product or service so that they can flip the company and make money.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Back last winter – in the beforetimes, as they say now – I did a lot of thinking about how I could be most politically impactful in this election cycle. What I landed on was fundraising focused on my state legislature here in North Carolina. <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2020/08/31/thoughts-on-fundraising/">I wrote a blog about it</a> – one of the few I’ve gotten around to writing this year – and promised a follow-up on what I learned about the nuts-and-bolts of indie political fundraising. So here is that follow-up.</p>

<p>When I launched the <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">Long Leaf Pine Slate</a> in January of 2020, I figured I might be able to raise a few thousand dollars from family and friends. Not much, but something. We wound up doing a lot more than that. “The Slate” caught fire, and over the course of the year, became <i>the largest independent channel of funding based in the state</i> to Democrats running for the North Carolina state legislature. We raised more than $300,000 from over a thousand donors for a small group of our most strategic Democratic candidates running against vulnerable Republican incumbents.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much if you’re used to reading about Senate races which raise tens of millions. But at the state legislative scale, that’s actually very big money. Here’s some comparison to give you a sense of scale:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png.pagespeed.ce.kwwoCB2JuC.png" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png.pagespeed.ce.kwwoCB2JuC.png 960w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xQ3-PAC-graphic-300x169.png.pagespeed.ic.5vOtQdpn_j.png 300w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xQ3-PAC-graphic-768x432.png.pagespeed.ic.GDK3GM5_As.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p>If the Long Leaf Pine Slate were a PAC, we’d have been the third-largest in the state and the single largest donor to Democrats based in North Carolina. Better: all of that money went to just a small group of our most important races. We raised almost as much money for those select Democrats as Duke Energy – basically the evil empire of right-wing power in North Carolina – gave to Republicans. (Directly, anyway. More on that later.)</p>
<p>The Long Leaf Pine Slate was nothing but <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">a website</a> that linked to an ActBlue fundraising page featuring our candidates and <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardcarolina">a Twitter account</a>. When donors gave, every dollar thus went directly to our candidates’ campaigns, nowhere else. The Slate was not, itself, a PAC – meaning we didn’t touch any money. You could not, for example, write a check to the Long Leaf Pine Slate. We didn’t even have a bank account. It was a 100% volunteer project.</p>
<p>Something similar to this – a no-nonsense ActBlue fundraising slate for state legislative candidates – should exist in every state. If you’re reading this, maybe you should start one, or join up with others who are. The purpose of this blog is to offer up some lessons learned, and maybe – just maybe – convince you, dear reader, that you can do this too.</p>
<h2>Why this model works</h2>
<p>An ActBlue fundraising page literally takes every dollar that is contributed and just slices it up among the campaign recipients you list. If there are ten campaigns listed, then each gets 10 cents. It’s that simple. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned PACs and parties act as intermediaries between a donor and the campaigns that need their money, and this causes lots of problems. Unfortunately, both (but particularly PACs) tend to be incredibly inefficient ways for donors to help the good guys, and wind up spending lots of money on things other than getting candidates elected. Very, very few people who give to PACs or parties ever actually look at the disclosures to see where their money went. Without naming names, I have been personally disappointed when I actually saw the spending disclosures from progressive PACs that I thought were good, but turned out to be big money-furnaces for politicos to get paid. (Caveat: yes, there are some good PACs too. They’re just rarer than you’d think.)</p>
<p>Besides its transparency, another large advantage of the ActBlue model is it allows organizations to raise substantially more money per candidate. If we’d been a PAC, we would’ve been limited to giving $5,400 per endorsed candidate – the legal maximum in North Carolina. But in the ActBlue model, <i>we’re</i> not the donor – in a way, we’re just pointing the actual donors to a list of candidates and saying, “these are the folks to give to.” So when you get lots and lots of folks giving money through that page, and each one can give up to the legal limit, it really adds up. ActBlue allows you to see just how much folks have given through your page, which is how we know the Slate raised so much money, almost entirely from folks who never would’ve found our candidates otherwise.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the PACs, the Long Leaf Pine Slate is completely invisible on NC campaign finance reports. All the reports show is the donors, not the online channel they used. This keeps the Republican oppo researchers guessing and the media clueless. But the candidates know very well, because their ActBlue candidate dashboards show exactly what fundraising pages their money is coming from.</p>
<p>Legal stuff: every state is different, but this model is perfectly compliant everywhere I’m aware of. In North Carolina, there are certain conditions where you need to establish a political committee to promote candidates for office – like if you spend much money doing it. We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">extremely basic webpage</a> – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-44e6abc51318">this explanatory post</a> about the Long Leaf Pine Slate that covers why raising money matters, why it’s hard for most candidates, and why that difficulty enables a lot of corporate corruption in our politics.</p>
<h2>What we did</h2>
<p>After I built the website and set up the ActBlue page, I knew that making a splash on social would be vital to winning eyeballs and attention for the Slate. So pre-launch, I begged a lot of big-audience folks on Twitter for retweets. Believe me, it felt as cringeworthy as it sounds. But incredibly, some obliged, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkander">Jason Kander</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers">Bakari Sellers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/">Jeff Jackson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII">Clint Smith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer">Dan Pfeiffer</a> and several more. The initial pop sent a lot of traffic and eyeballs on the project, and a little money. It made a difference. (Over time, I noticed that social eyeballs were good for traffic, but not so much for money.)</p>
<p>But what really made the Slate grow was just flogging it relentlessly every day. It was honestly a real grind. I sent hundreds of cold emails. (Didn’t work.) I promoted the Slate on Twitter, explaining why it was important. (Kinda worked.) <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate">I blogged about it</a> (useful for inbound traffic, sometimes for money).</p>
<p>What I found was that successfully fundraising requires you to be needy, persistent and a little bit pushy. Very, very few people will ever volunteer to give you money. You have to ask. And the vast majority of people you ask (directly or not) will say no. And just like in a job interview, you can’t take it personally. (If I cold emailed you and asked for money, sorry!) Asking for money sucks. I don’t like it and I don’t think anyone else does, either. But doing so for a good cause makes it a little easier, and over time, I got used to it.</p>
<p>I just kept doing this all year. Call it a “hustle” or “bootstrapping” or whatever you like, but slowly and gradually, folks started paying attention. We started raising more money. A real audience began to develop. I started writing <a href="https://thelongleafpineslate.substack.com/">email updates</a> to our donors, and those were a hit. Our list grew.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, another fun fact: as a fundraising page owner, ActBlue gives you the ability to ask your donors whether they want to share their email addresses with the recipient campaigns or not. I enabled this, so that every contributor to the Slate got to choose. The Slate still gets your email address, but whether recipient campaigns do was up to you. I now have a rather large donor list, and I made everyone a promise: the Slate will never, ever share or sell your email. It’s just not a deal I’m interested in. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I knew we must be doing something right when Republican spies started sniffing around. I started getting emails from “supporters” I didn’t recognize, from obviously fake email addresses, asking for recordings from candidate calls. (<a href="https://americarisingpac.org/about/">America Rising</a> lackeys, I see you!) The Slate works in public, so this was fine – a vote of confidence if nothing else.</p>
<h2>So, what happened?</h2>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here: we still lost many of the races we backed.</p>
<p>So was this all a failure? Nah. The money mattered. But as I always remind people, money is just ammunition. It doesn’t buy races. We were able to raise money early in the cycle, which mattered a lot for our candidates. (For a campaign, $1 in October is worth $5 in January.) We funded candidates in “frontier” districts, where the fundamentals were hard, often in rural and exurban areas. Most of our candidates outperformed Biden in their districts, but unfortunately, the “top of the ticket” just didn’t perform as well in NC as we needed it to. Democrats nationwide had a rather poor showing downballot, so it wasn’t just us.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a total loss. Some of our candidates (both millennials!) won. In other places, we funded campaigns where there hadn’t been a really legit Democratic campaign in a decade or more. Even though we lost, there’s now a network of volunteers in place and up-to-date supporter lists that will make subsequent campaigns much stronger. To win, you need to run candidates in difficult districts, and when you do that, some of them are going to lose.</p>
<p>Besides – we were also badly outspent. Remember Duke Energy above? Well, aside from their direct (“hard”) giving, they sunk millions of dollars into a dark-money super PAC to run ads and mailers vilifying Democrats. So did the NC Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s super PAC, Citizens for a Better North Carolina, was run by two former top aides to Phil Berger (the GOP State Senate leader) who now have their own political consultancy. (Though of course, I’m sure all of their business was conducted without any …</p></div></div>

                <p>A powerful and lightweight library for visualizing networks/graphs</p>
            </div><section>
                <div>
                    <div><p><em>Guest post written by Chris Klose - Data Scientist</em></p><p>If you're a data scientist or anyone else who likes to use network graphics, you'll want to try out the new <a href="https://github.com/ChrisChross/streamlit-agraph">Streamlit Agraph component</a> to create knowledge graphs. A knowledge graph is a graph that represents knowledge about entities and their relations in a flexible manner which offers more freedom than static relational database schemas. The term was originally introduced by Google in 2012 and they wrote a great blog post called <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not/" rel="noopener">“Things not strings”</a> about the advantages of knowledge graphs [also the short video in the blogpost is pretty awesome] . </p></div><p>Now let's get our hands dirty and use the Agraph component to build a simple graph.</p><h2 id="build-a-graph-to-visualize-inspirational-people">Build a graph to visualize inspirational people</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For our simple graph, we want to find out how famous people were inspired - so which famous person inspired whom or by whom he/she was inspired. We also want to visualize these persons and the relationships in the graph.</p><p>To do this, we'll go through these steps:</p><ol><li>Query data from a SPARQL endpoint (<a href="http://dbpedia.org/sparql" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dbpedia.org/sparql</a> using SPARQLWrapper library) to get a JSON file.</li><li>Parse from JSON to Python and then create a triple (nodes and edges representing famous people and either &nbsp;two types of relations 1: inspired, 2: was_inspired_by).</li><li>Publish our app with Streamlit sharing.</li></ol><h2 id="install-the-libraries">Install the libraries</h2><p>To follow along in the tutorial you'll need to install the following libraries in a terminal:</p><pre><code>
pip install Streamlit
pip install streamlit-agraph
pip install SPARQLWrapper

</code></pre><h2 id="get-the-data">Get the data</h2><p>After we've installed the needed libraries, we'll want to write a small function that defines SPARQL query and crawls the data (if you’re not familiar with sparql that's ok):</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What's important to understand from this snippet?</p><p>One of the key classes of Agraph is the <strong>TripleStore </strong>- it serves as the central data store. Internally, the TripleStore consists of <em>three</em> <em>sets</em>, each belonging to the <strong>Nodes</strong>, <strong>Edges</strong> and <strong>Triples</strong> classes respectively. By using sets it's ensured that no duplicate triples, nodes or edges are added and it allows easier conversion to other data types.</p><p>New triples can be added to the TripleStore with this method:</p><pre><code>store.add_triple(node, edge, node)</code></pre><p>We only have to pass the source node, the edge, and the target node<br>(<strong>Notice</strong>: the order matters in this case!).</p><h2 id="create-the-streamlit-app-with-triplestore">Create the Streamlit app with TripleStore </h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To render an Agraph component we have to pass three parameters to the function. </p><p>1. A list of nodes where each node is an instance of the class Node.<br>At this point we can take advantage of the TripleStore as follows:</p><pre><code>list(store.getNodes())</code></pre><p>2. &nbsp;A list of edges where each edge is an instance of the class Edge:</p><pre><code>list(store.getEdges())</code></pre><p>3. The class offers the opportunity to define general settings for the rendering:</p><pre><code>config = Config(height=500,
		width=700, 
                nodeHighlightBehavior=True,
                highlightColor="#F7A7A6", 
                directed=True, 
                collapsible=True)</code></pre><p>Finally, we can plug all three parts into the Agraph component, and can now see the results by running:</p><pre><code>streamlit run app.py
</code></pre><p>Check it out yourself! 🙂</p><h3 id="you-can-run-this-without-triplestore">You can run this without TripleStore</h3><p>It's not necessary to use a TripleStore. The Agraph component takes nodes and edges separately, which is due to the fact that both classes themselves provide a multitude of parameters for customization. Each instance of the class Nodes and Edges must have at least one unique identifier - which will usually be a string. For example, we could do:</p><pre><code>
nodes = []
edges = []
nodes.append(Node(id="Spiderman", size=400, svg="http://marvel-force-chart.surge.sh/marvel_force_chart_img/top_spiderman.png") )
nodes.append( Node(id="Captain_Marvel", size=400, svg="http://marvel-force-chart.surge.sh/marvel_force_chart_img/top_captainmarvel.png") )
edges.append( Edge(source="Captain_Marvel", target="Spiderman", type="CURVE_SMOOTH"))

</code></pre><h2 id="push-the-app-to-streamlit-sharing">Push the app to Streamlit sharing</h2><p>For deploying the component I used Streamlit sharing, which for now is invite only, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">but you can sign up here</a>. After your invite to <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up" rel="noopener">Streamlit sharing</a> comes in - the process to deploy your app is simple:</p><ul><li>Upload the code to a public GitHub repo</li><li><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/">Login to Streamlit sharing</a> </li><li>Deploy your app with 3 clicks (New App &gt; Choose Repo &gt; Deploy). </li><li>Done 🎈 </li></ul><p>If you'd like to read a bit more about the deployment process on sharing - <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/deploying-streamlit-apps-using-streamlit-sharing/">check out this tutorial</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>After that we're done and congrats! &nbsp;We just finished the complete development process from idea to implementation in breathtaking speed 🎉. You can see an example of the Streamlit-Agraph component <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/chrischross/inspirationals/main/main.py">via this sharing app</a> and the source code <a href="https://github.com/ChrisChross/Inspirationals">can be found here</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions or have ideas on how to improve the component feel free to leave a comment below or to message me via the following channels:</p><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/ChristianKlose3" rel="noopener">@ChristianKlose3</a> on Twitter</li><li>Github <a href="https://github.com/ChrisChross/" rel="noopener">ChrisChross</a> (create a new Issue)</li><li><a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/u/chris_klose/summary" rel="noopener">Streamlit Community</a></li></ul>

If you have not not seen it yet, go stream that masterpiece right now. #spoilers</p><p id="0d41"><strong>Why is this particular line so important?</strong> Because it is part of the keychain needed to unlock the many abstract concepts Lynch and Mark Frost presents to us, the viewers. The line is from the episode where Mike enters the dream of agent Cooper, revealing clues about Laura Palmers killer. What I find interesting about this line is its deceptive yet clear intention. The viewer is told what to pay attention to, but the dreamy context suggest we might be deceived.</p><p id="f29a">But some things are just what it is, how it sounds.</p><p id="57db"><em>Intuition guides us, one screen at the time.</em></p><p id="4949">For 10 years, I was writing for various advertising companies. My job was to craft words to lure the reader into whatever brand-context I was working on at that time, often with the help of abstractions of concepts, allegories, and other creative tools. It taught me a lot about perception and how I could, very subtly, plant hints for the viewer to decipher the brand message. But most importantly, it made me understand how the brain systematically create mental concepts to percieve and understand the world around it. Words play a crucial part in this process. An incredible 50 % of all words we hear cannot be understood out of context (when presented in isolation). By using concepts, the brain learns to categorize and make sense of all this variable noisy flow of information.</p><p id="b300">How ironic, you might think, that I found clarity in one of the most surreal dreamscapes ever to air on TV in our lifetime. To me, that’s the beauty of inspiration. It rises to our consciousness like wild salmon jumping upstream a river, striving to get a foothold in our mind amidst all the noise.</p><p id="4668">Like Lynch and Frost, I left the keys in plain sight for the audience to discover and interpret. Creative advertising requires just that, an idea we, the creators, code, and then let the audience decode. But UX Writing very often requires quite the opposite. You must write it like it is.</p><p id="856a">It has always been a beautiful mystery to me, how clarity has the power to shape us. How it informs us simply by being less intrusive or more truthful. <br>To me clarity is not the equivalent of writing short and efficient sentences. It can be about that, but not just that. Clarity is about finding the true essence of whatever you’re trying to convey. It’s what will make your followers believe you or not and go where you’re guiding them. Or not.</p><blockquote><p id="edd9"><strong><em>Just do it</em></strong></p><p id="2f63"><strong><em>I have a dream</em></strong></p><p id="78b1"><strong><em>Fire, walk with me</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="d321">But clarity is also this</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1660/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png" width="830" height="1170" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Airbnb safely disarming thousands of anxious customers with one single line of text.</figcaption></figure><p id="e258">The real challenge is to fuse the two worlds into one.

So, you don’t have to just play, say, if the first verse just needs two and four on the hi-hat, you don’t have to just sit there going… <em>&lt;taps uninspired on the hi-hat&gt;</em> …what I would do is listen to the vocalist and look for spaces to do small musical embellishments. <strong>Put it in the right place, and it’s beautiful. Do it every bar, and it’s horrible.”</strong></p><p id="2340">This is <strong><em>precisely</em></strong> what UX Writers should do (among many other important things). Listen to the project as a whole, look for spaces in between code, design, text, menus, forms — literally every point of interaction — to create something that elevates the project, and therefore the brand. Band. You know what I mean. And yes, I consider UX Writing to be an essential part of building and/or maintaining a brand.</p><p id="d052">Words are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_note" rel="noopener">ghost notes</a> providing subtle dynamics to the sonic scenery. They will make people feel something.</p><p id="5f16">Humans like to be liked. Brands too. Therefore we make and effort to portray ourselves, man and brand, in a way that will serve as purposeful and friendly for our peers. From a brand point of view we would very much like people to feel what we want them to feel about us. This is usually where marketing says “we got this”. And they probably do. Persuasion is needed to increase awareness and market shares. But what happens after we get their attention?</p><p id="fe63">This is where guidance and clarity is provided and needed, not juicy headlines and rethorical tropes. Now it’s time to go with (and steer) the flow.</p><p id="eca1">Some people understand this process intuitively and how to utilize it in many different ways. In a talk at Design Matters 2019, Senior Product Writer at Slack <a href="https://medium.com/u/6aad0c825c59?source=post_page-----2b81f09aadfc--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Schmidt</a> shared insight from Slacks early days on how language could be a tool for identifying “bad” design, and how they discovered when to inject brand personality and how to do it. They came up with a very simple and interesting rule:</p><p id="f0e8"><strong>Never try to make the user feel<br></strong>Instead, look for the feelings they’re already having.<br>And just be part of those.</p><p id="c24e"><strong>👇🏻</strong></p></div></div><div><div><p id="84c2">I believe Slack is on the right path when it comes to how they percieve UX Writing. They have chosen a much less intrusive approach in a world where our minds are bombarded with emotional hooks ready to be reeled in. But for enhancing your UX Writing, I think being subtle and aware (but don’t forget to surprise once in a while) will take you far.</p><p id="acbe">Is your brands presence needed for solving this particular task?<br>Or is it better to get out of the way for a bit? <br><a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-power-of-whitespace-a1a95e45f82b" rel="noopener"><strong>Treat words in the same way designers treat white space.</strong></a></p><p id="cf73">My family owns a summer cabin near the ocean. In my younger days, I would cruise around in our family’s tiny motorboat. That was when I learned the concept of a rudder, a gentle device for navigating smoothly across the sea. This information suddenly reappeared a few years ago when I was writing about ergonomic seating. The company I wrote for had designed a new office chair that kept the person in it slightly moving while sitting down. One of them sat in the chair and used their feet to move around. Seeing this, I suggested to the designers that the feet act as a rudder to navigate the body. According to them, this was a perfect description of what they had accomplished.</p><p id="c439"><strong>I looked. I listened. And I found the embellishment I was looking for.</strong></p><p id="5e4a">In this ocean of information we’re slowly drowning in, I like to think of microcopy as an invisible rudder for our intuition. It’s there to guide you through interactive waters, shallow or deep, without you seeing it. If you can see the rudder, you’ve probably hit bottom, and then you have to slow down to understand the situation. When designing interactivity, people crave fluidity. Like in a musical piece that captivates us or in a movie that enthralls us with great dialogue and scenery. Or even a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 whose job is to help us navigate 60+ hours of content while keeping us immersed in their universe. Well played.</p><p id="54c3">Our understanding of the world is layered in mental concepts. Everything can be stripped down to its very basic components. Even what we know to be basic components has its own basic components. By understanding this, one becomes humble when faced with the task of understanding complex matters. Or answering complicated questions.</p><p id="24c2">Whenever I write, my goal is always to find the simplest version of the truth intended. By truth, I mean the pieces of information I relay to people who desire an outcome of some sort, typically in an app or landing page. Sometimes I need to let function dictate what I write; other times, it feels like a good time to sparkle with some creativity.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2238/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png" width="1119" height="1117" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A good example of creative microcopy.

<p>As a professional photographer, we always want to get the best shot and use the best photo editing software to select and edit. However, to get the best images, some photographers capture more than just one photo.</p>
<p>Having a safe shot and another angle is an excellent practice for photographers. Nonetheless, you’ll also get if not hundreds, but thousands of photos when you get home, and you need to go through all of them.</p>
<p>Let’s face it; culling photos can take a lot of time and take a toll on your productivity. Here are some of the reasons that can also affect your productivity when culling photos:</p>
<h2 id="procrastination-becomes-your-muse">Procrastination Becomes Your Muse</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/procastination.jpg" alt="Procrastination Becomes Your Muse" title="Procrastination Becomes Your Muse"></p>
<p>It’s not a secret that all professionals procrastinate at some point because, let’s face it, people get tired - you are not alone. You can also get distracted or even don’t have the strength to power through your work, and it’s normal and acceptable.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that you can do to make punctuality and timeliness your muse, again:</p>
<h3 id="forgive-yourself">Forgive yourself</h3>
<p>Don’t dwell on your past procrastination and forgive yourself. Forgiveness is essential so you can start anew and move forward in working on your deliverables.</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-reason-why-youre-avoiding-the-task">Identify the reason why you’re avoiding the task</h3>
<p>Make sure to find the cause or reason why you’re avoiding work or culling your photos. Then, find a solution for you to avoid getting stuck.</p>
<h3 id="cull-your-to-do-list">Cull your to-do list</h3>
<p>Yes, we’re talking about photos here, but it’s also essential to look at the bigger picture and look at your overall to-do list. In this way, you can focus on culling and editing your photos without any distractions.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-multitasking">Avoid multitasking</h3>
<p>If we don’t focus on one task, even if we have the best photo editing software to aid us, we still wouldn’t get things done. So, make sure to focus on what’s essential or top on your to-do list.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-have-a-culling-criteria">You Don’t Have a Culling Criteria</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/dont-have-culling-criteria.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/RLw-UC03Gwc" title="https://unsplash.com/photos/RLw-UC03Gwc">https://unsplash.com/photos/RLw-UC03Gwc</a></p>
<p>Photo culling software and tools are essential, but the most important aspect, however, is your culling criteria. If you don’t have one, then, chances are, this is one of the reasons why you’re failing.</p>
<p>Here are some of the steps and process to help you create your criteria today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove out-of-place photos in your album</li>
<li>Remove blurry, overexposed, or underexposed photos</li>
<li>Remove duplicate photos in your album</li>
<li>Accidental pictures and another unnecessary frame should be removed from your album</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="you-delete-photos-instead-of-selecting-good-ones">You Delete Photos Instead of Selecting Good Ones</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/dont-delete-photos.jpeg" alt="You Delete Photos Instead of Selecting Good Ones" title="You Delete Photos Instead of Selecting Good Ones"></p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/XveTTNSrhnQ" title="https://unsplash.com/photos/XveTTNSrhnQ">https://unsplash.com/photos/XveTTNSrhnQ</a></p>
<p>It’s human nature to consider often or even act on deleting bad photos in your album or set for the day. It’s a normal instinct but, human as we are, it’s also a flawed approach in culling photos.</p>
<p>Here are the things you need to think about when culling photos before touching the delete key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not delete photos even if it is below your standards, or you don’t like it.</li>
<li>Remember that it is easier to select than to delete hundreds of photos.</li>
<li>You need to take a second look at the album, especially if you need more photos to send your clients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="you-dont-use-the-right-photo-editing-and-culling-software">You Don’t Use the Right Photo Editing and Culling Software</h2>
<p>There are many photo editing and culling software in the market that offers help for photographers and editors. However, it would help if you considered the following criteria when choosing software:</p>
<h3 id="the-software-can-detect-exposure-problems">The software can detect exposure problems:</h3>
<p>Most simply, exposure is how light or dark the image will appear when the camera captures it. With this, the culling software that you need to use should have an exposure algorithm. The algorithm can detect whether the human subject is extremely over or underexposed.</p>
<p>AI is essential in this kind of software to ensure that you get the best results. Don’t hesitate to add images that don’t have humans as their subjects because some software can still detect exposure in the photos.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-detect-out-of-focus-images-and-blurred-images">It can detect out of focus images and blurred images.</h3>
<p>Another algorithm that you need to look for in culling software is the Blur Algorithm or its capacity to identify intentional blur from unintentional blur.</p>
<p>The algorithm is usually 90% accurate in detecting which subjects are blurry in the photo and to how much extent.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-detect-closed-eyes-subjects-in-the-images">It can detect closed eyes subjects in the images.</h3>
<p>Some photographers go the extra mile in editing closed eyes in photographs. However, if you have thousands of photos that you can choose from, then it’s best to use software that can help you choose photos with subjects that have open eyes.</p>
<p>Choose software that has the AI to detect the distance between the upper and lower eyelids. This way, it can detect whether the eyes are unintentionally closed or half-closed in the photos.</p>
<h2 id="you-are-not-critical-when-choosing-your-photos">You are Not Critical when Choosing Your Photos</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/choose-your-photos.jpeg" alt="You are Not Critical when Choosing Your Photos" title="You are Not Critical when Choosing Your Photos"></p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/photos-in-laptop?orientation=landscape" title="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/photos-in-laptop?orientation=landscape">https://unsplash.com/s/photos/photos-in-laptop?orientation=landscape</a></p>
<p>Photographers have different styles and approaches. Therefore, you need to follow your gut first when culling photos. This gut instinct develops over the years in the industry, but don’t worry if you are still new in your profession.</p>
<p>Again, you can choose to use photo culling software in your process to aid you with selection. You’ll be able to develop a keen and faster gut reaction in the future as long as you practice and follow your workflow.</p>
<h2 id="you-forget-to-rate-your-photos">You Forget to Rate Your Photos</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/forgot-rating-photos.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/books-notebook-macbook-table-56759/" title="https://www.pexels.com/photo/books-notebook-macbook-table-56759/">https://www.pexels.com/photo/books-notebook-macbook-table-56759/</a></p>
<p>We need to go back to the idea of not deleting photos when it comes to rating photos. So, again, instead of deleting pictures, you can filter them out using the star rating in Lightroom.</p>
<p>Once you’ve culled photos from your software, take a second look, and rate the images. You can add a star for your pictures that you want to provide to your client. Two stars can also be used as additional photos for the album. Lastly, those with three stars are for your online and offline publication.</p>
<p>Honestly, these tips accompanied by the best photo editing and culling software will surely help make your job easier.</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<p>If you’re anything like me you have made many “new” projects for the web. Perhaps a little website, an API or some little test thing for your friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then: <em>you need to deploy</em>. The first time it’s usually still fine. You’ve done this before. You build your Dockerfile, recycle an old kubespec / deployment.yaml and <code>kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml</code> It’s online; life is good.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>This article is really about what comes after that</strong></h3>



<p>You find a problem. Fix it in your code, docker build the image again, push it. Re-run kubectl apply. Refresh. hmm. the fix doesn’t show up!?</p>



<p><em>The problem is that Kubernetes (and Docker) don’t automatically pull a new version of your image when you don’t change the name of your image.</em></p>



<p>In this article I’m going to help you make the best, simplest, reproducible deployments possible.&nbsp; You may not know about ‘Make’, and if you mostly do .js or python it may feel a bit oldscool. But it’s actually very simple to use, and much more friendly than building your own ‘deploy.sh’ or ‘deploy.py’. Make will be the basis of what I show here.</p>



<p>In this guide I’m going to add the build steps one by one.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 1: Building your Dockerfile</strong></h3>



<p>I’ll assume this is nothing new to you. Instead I will just give you my two best tips:</p>



<ul><li>Docker has two build engines, the newer is called Docker Buildkit, and can be called with docker buildx build . it is <em>much smarter </em>for things like caching. Use it like so: <code>docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></li><li>Do expensive installs before copying in your code, this will help Docker leverage the caching and be much faster. For web projects this means I’ll do:</li></ul>



<pre><code>FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app/
COPY package.json
RUN npm install
# and only then
COPY . . </code></pre>



<p>Ok, now we’re going to use <strong>Make</strong> to make our life easier. Just make a file named <code>makefile</code> and put in the following content:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code>dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></pre>



<p>Now you can do <code>make dockerize</code> and it will save you a lot of typing! — We’re going to do more of that. Note I call it ‘dockerize’ because you may want to also ‘build’ for just a local building of the project.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2 – Pushing it to the Docker Hub</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’ll also add a step in the Makefile to push it to the Docker hub, like so:</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image) .

push:
	docker push $(image)</code></pre>



<p>Notice that I’m introducing a variable here. image. If you define them at top of your Makefile they will be are available throughout your file.</p>



<p>Great! To make our life easier we can also chain commands like so:</p>



<pre><code>$ make dockerize push</code></pre>



<h3><strong>Step 3 – Deploying it</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’re going to deploy our freshly built and pushed image to our Kubernetes cluster. I’ll assume you have a deployment spec called deployment.yaml which contains something like:</p>



<pre><code>      containers:
        - name: cool-website
          image: my-repo/project</code></pre>



<p>And we add the following to our Makefile</p>



<pre><code>deployment: 
	kubectl deploy -f deployment.yaml

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>The deployment part is nothing new. But notice how with deploy we add the verbs after deploy? This is to trigger those things <em>first</em></p>



<p>So now we can type make deploy, and Make will do everything for us.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 4 – RE-deploying</strong></h3>



<p>Now, this is where it gets interesting. If you make changes to your code and run make deploy again you’ll notice a new image will be built and deployed, but your deployment will not be updated. This is because the <em>image name</em> didn’t change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A (wrong)&nbsp; solution is to add ‘imagePullPolicy: always’ to your deployment. And this may actually work for you. But my experience is that it does not always work, and it’s really hard to see which version is running in production.</p>



<p>A better way is to add a version to your image!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lets consider the following Makefile</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>Here we introduce a variable $(version), but instead of defining it in the Makefile you can just define it at runtime, like so:</p>



<pre><code>make deploy version=2</code></pre>



<p>A special note is to be given to the modification to the deployment step. What I do here is to use the Stream Editor ‘sed’ to find and replace the word :latest with the version you specify. So essentially we edit the file and then stream it straight into kubectl to deploy it.</p>



<p>For this to work you need to make sure you tag your image name in your deployment file as image: my-repo/project:latest&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try it! You can now easily deploy new versions.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 5 — Using git</strong></h3>



<p>As you are working on a project a little longer it’s nice to actually refer to a given version ‘running’ to code committed. And luckily ‘git’ allows for showing you which commit you are on. So lets add the following line to the top of our makefile:</p>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)</code></pre>



<p>What this line does is call out to the shell and run git describe, which returns information about the current git branch and commit you are on. –tags –always –abbrev=7 and –dirty help to format the returned string into something clear and usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you use this you don’t need to specify the version, and can just type <code>make deploy</code>. Power tip: You can still use <code>version=22</code></p>



<h3>The complete Makefile</h3>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)
image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Existential Haskell]]>

November 26, 2020 | https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The majority of software engineering literature portrays object-oriented programming as distinct from, and often irreconcilable with, functional programming. This is, of course, a false dichotomy, as the techniques encouraged by functional programming are applicable in even the most object-oriented languages. Yet object-orientation, being perhaps history’s most popular software paradigm, has popularized its tenets, and occasionally we can see them show up even in programming languages like Haskell, a language about as antithetical to the object-oriented philosophy as possible.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll describe a common example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">information hiding</a> in ALGOL-style languages like Java, then express that in terms compatible with Haskell. We’ll then use this technique to port a <em>responder chain</em> to Haskell, demonstrating how Haskell supports dynamic function dispatch in the presence of hidden type information. I write this not because I expect to break any new ground—all the techniques I use here are long-documented in the literature, and Haskell veterans will probably find little new in this post<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Those familiar with the care and feeding of existential types may wish to skip to the penultimate section, which contains a couple useful data types that I haven’t yet seen in the wild.</span></span>—but because the existing resources are scattered, perhaps oddly so given how central dynamic dispatch is to most programming languages that aren’t Haskell, and because exploring the edge cases in the design illustrates the compromises inherent in language and library design.</p>

<p>Most of the world’s statically-typed programming languages allow their users to write code resembling the following Java:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>Comparable</span> <span>someFn</span>() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>return</span> <span>"a concrete String value"</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Syntactically, this code is uncontroversial: it’s a function that returns a value. Its only interesting aspect lies in the function signature−even though the function body returns a value of type <code>String</code>, its return type is declared to be <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html"><code>Comparable</code></a>, which is not a concrete data type, but a Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>. As such, we cannot treat the result of this function call as the <code>String</code> it actually is; we can only interact with it via the methods defined on the <code>Comparable</code> interface. This application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">rule of least power</a> is a useful one, even in a strongly-typed language like Haskell: sometimes we want to hide the implementation details of a function’s return type.</p>
<p>We can try to write the same thing in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>someComparableValue ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2">someComparableValue _ <span>=</span> <span>"a concrete string value"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because this is not semantically-valid Haskell, we get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:3:27: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘[Char]’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          someComparableValue :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; Int -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Haskell’s typechecker looks at the body of this function and says “hey, man, you’re returning a concrete string value here, not ’any type that is <code>Ord</code>–erable.’” Though this is a valid notion in Java, it’s not valid in Haskell. Another perspective on this is that Java allows a value to have more than one type: we can treat a Java string literal as a value of type <code>java.lang.String</code>, or of type<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>even though <code>Comparable</code> is an interface, not a concrete type</span></span> <code>Comparable</code>, or of its superclass <code>java.lang.Object</code>. However, since Haskell doesn’t support inheritance, Haskell treats its values as having one, and only one, type. Working around this takes a judicious application of an existential type.</p>

<p>In Haskell, an <em>existential</em> data type is one that is defined in terms not of a concrete type, but in terms of a quantified type variable, introduced on the right-hand side of the data declaration. This is, as is the case for so many Haskell concepts, not a particularly helpful definition in the abstract. It’s easier to show than to tell, so let’s take a look at one of the canonical examples of an existential type: a <code>Showable</code> type that wraps any type that implements the <code>Show</code> interface.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are several interesting things about this data type. Firstly, it uses the <code>forall</code> keyword to introduce the <code>a</code> type variable: given that we’re dealing with <em>exist</em>-ential types, it threw me for a loop that there wasn’t an <code>exists</code> keyword.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Scala reserves a <code>forSome</code> keyword for this purpose, which I think reads a little more accurately in terms of the intent of introducing this type variable: using the phrase “for all” is a bit inapposite given that the <code>Showable</code> constructor is applied to single values at a time.</span></span> Considering the constructor of <code>Showable</code> is perhaps more enlightening:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t <span>Showable</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can read this as “<code>Showable</code> is a constructor that takes, for all types <code>a</code> such that <code>a</code> implements <code>Show</code>, an <code>a</code> value, and returns a value of type <code>Showable</code>, the internal <code>a</code> value of which is no longer visible to the world once it’s been applied.”</p>
<p>Secondly, we can’t use a <code>newtype</code> to declare an existential. Attempting to write the following:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>results in an error message:</p>
<pre><code>• A newtype constructor cannot have a context in its type
  Showable :: forall a. Show a =&gt; a -&gt; Showable
• In the definition of data constructor ‘Showable’
  In the newtype declaration for ‘Showable’
</code></pre>
<p>When we consider typeclasses as <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/fluent-polymorphism-type-applications.html">dictionaries</a>, this restriction makes more sense: in GHC Core, this <code>Show a</code> constraint will be represented as a hypothetical <code>ShowDict</code> data type containing implementations for the <code>show</code>, <code>showsPrec</code>, and <code>showList</code> functions. In this light, we can see that <code>Showable</code> takes <em>two</em> parameters, not one: an <code>a</code> value to wrap, as well as the <code>ShowDict</code> dictionary associated with that value’s type. Newtypes exist to wrap single values, and here we’re wrapping both a datum and its associated <code>Show</code> dictionary: as a result, here we need a <code>data</code> declaration, even though the associated <code>Showable</code> constructor takes only one value (in Haskell surface syntax). This is an understandable limitation, though it would be cool if existential values of this sort could opt into the <code>deriving</code> mechanism in the manner of newtypes.</p>
<p>A third interesting thing: we can’t write a function that unwraps this data type. What might seem like an intuitive type for the function is rejected:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>-- GHC will reject this.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>unwrapShowable ::</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">unwrapShowable (<span>Showable</span> a) <span>=</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see this explained a little more closely if we use the record selector syntax.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> {<span> getShowable ::</span> a }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Attempting to use <code>getShowable</code> as a function that extracts some arbitrary <code>Show</code>–inhabiting type produces a well-explained error messages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:1:1: error:
    • Cannot use record selector ‘getShowable’ as a function due to escaped type variables
      Probable fix: use pattern-matching syntax instead
    • In the expression: getShowable
</code></pre>
<p>The mental model I use here is that applying a constructor of an existential type serves as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a> for type information. In other languages we can assemble heterogenous lists natively; in Haskell, by contrast, we have to opt into it explicitly: applying the <code>Showable</code> constructor to a value swallows its type information. We can’t write a function, whether the hand-written <code>unwrapShowable</code> or descending from our <code>getShowable</code> record selector, that unwraps some arbitrary type out of an existential. All that is retained is the ability, given a proper <code>case</code> statement to unwrap the value within the existential, to <code>Show</code> the value contained therein: it cannot <em>escape</em> its scope, as the error message above explains<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>We can, however, use the <code>getShowable</code> record selector to update the wrapped value present in a <code>Showable</code>.</span></span>.</p>
<p>We can, as I mentioned above, cross the event horizon with a <code>case</code> statement, binding the <code>Show</code>–conforming contents to a variable name:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>let</span> shown <span>=</span> <span>case</span> x <span>of</span> <span>Showable</span> val <span>-&gt;</span> <span>show</span> val</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inside the right-hand-side of this <code>case</code> statement, we have a value <code>x</code> in scope. A quick inquiry with type holes reveals the type we expect:</p>
<pre><code>• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:28:15)
  Constraints include Show a (from &lt;interactive&gt;:28:11-15)
</code></pre>
<p>All we know about this value <code>x</code> is that we can call <code>Show</code> on it. Other than passing it to the basic combinators (<code>id</code> and <code>const</code>), that’s <em>all we can do</em> with this value. Any bit of type information has been lost, replaced instead with <em>capabilities</em>, via typeclasses. Again, when we consider typeclasses as dictionary parameters, we can visualize how this works on a core-calculus level: we discard type information, including only the relevant dictionaries provided by the context of the <code>forall</code>.</p>
<p>A fourth and final interesting thing about this type is that you can write it, using the <code>GADTs</code> GHC extension, without an explicit <code>forall</code> keyword:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This stems from the fact that GADTs allow us to introduce per-constructor type variables and associated constraints, even if the type variable is not visible externally. Another thing to note is that data declarations containing existential values don’t have to be limited to a single value: they can hold concrete values, or values expressed with more <code>forall</code>–introduced type variables.</p>

<p>Being able to hide implementation details of a function’s return type is all well and good, but many users are going to need to convert (or attempt to convert) from an existential type back into a concrete type. Java provides this functionality with the <code>instanceof</code> operator and its cast syntax:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>Comparable</span> c = <span>someFn</span>();</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>if</span> c <span>instanceof</span> <span>String</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-3">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Got a string: "</span> + (<span>String</span>)c);</span>
<span id="cb14-4">} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Casting to a String here would raise a ClassCastException"</span>);</span>
<span id="cb14-6">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a consequence of all Java objects descending from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and the ability of the <code>instanceof</code> operator to query the type of an object at runtime. Though …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I could probably achieve 300% more in 6 years as a programmer if I knew these things when I started.</p>
<h2 id="coding-is-not-about-the-coding">Coding Is Not About The Coding</h2>
<p>What do you think programming is about?</p>
<p>Writing code?</p>
<p>Writing good code?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It's just a part of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Programming is not about coding, programming is about solving problems with coding.</strong></p>
<p>End customers don’t care what technologies, languages, frameworks, or methodologies you use. They care only about one thing, whether your product solves their problem or not.</p>
<p>That’s why no one cares what technologies Google search is using under the hood. Until people can find relative information with it, they will use it.</p>
<p>It’s the number one thing I wish I knew when I started programming.</p>
<p>I would spend less time writing “best code” and more time solving customer’s problems best.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t write code just to write code, solve customer’s problems with the code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="communication-skills-more-important-than-coding-skills">Communication Skills More Important Than Coding Skills</h2>
<p>When I just started my career, lack of social skills was not my main problem. But when I moved higher, to the middle, senior, and leadership position, my weak soft skills became my Achilles heel.</p>
<p>When you work on a product with a group of different people (engineers, designers, managers), communication is the only thing that makes you a “team” and helps you effectively develop the product.</p>
<p>Lack of social skills does the opposite, it decreases the product development time and overall productivity.</p>
<p>Here is the real situation you might face:</p>
<p>The leadership team tells your product manager that they want to create a new product feature and put it in the next product release. It’s not urgent, they just want to release it as soon as possible (as always).</p>
<p>The product Manager calls you on Zoom, tells you what you need to build, and asks, <em>“How much time do you need to build it?”</em></p>
<p>You are doing a rough calculation and tell, <em>“I need 20 hours.”</em></p>
<p>The Product Manager is not satisfied with your answer. He wants to release it as soon as possible and show the management that he can deliver results fast (this is a very common situation).</p>
<p>So he asks you, <em>“Can you build it for 10 hours? We really need this feature in the next product release!”</em></p>
<p>And you know that you can if you cut the corners (no tests, messy code) but then you will need to refactor it, and it will take an additional 30 hours. Because other engineers will work with your messy code when you release it. And after refactoring, you will need to integrate their code with yours.</p>
<p>So here’s what will happen next. If you have bad social skills, you will not convince the Product Manager that you actually need 20 hours to build this feature. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Product Managers often have good social skills, from my experience. So if you can’t convince him that refactoring later is worse than spending 20 hours right now, he will easily argue with you and convince you that “refactoring later is okay.” And the whole team will lose additional 30 hours for this refactoring (I don't count the time to fix unpredictable bugs after).</p>
<p>But if you have good communication skills you will be able to convince him of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>So improve your social skills as well as coding skills</strong> (send memes in the group chats on Slack or something).</p>
<p>And remember one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>People work with people, not machines.</strong></p>
<h2 id="regular-breaks-help-to-program-better">Regular Breaks Help To Program Better</h2>
<p>For 4 years I always feel exhausted after work. Somehow I could productively work only for a couple of hours. After that, I didn't have much energy. Until I learned about the Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>It’s quite simple. You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Your working routine becomes:</p>
<p>8:00-8:25 – Work</p>
<p>8:25-8:30 – Break</p>
<p>8:30-8:55 – Work</p>
<p>8:55-9:00 – Break</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I tried it for a week and was surprised at how focused, energetic, and productive I became  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-technique/">the science behind Pomodoro</a>)</p>
<p>Then I went further and implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1303037682294173699">52+17 system</a> and my productivity levels spiked by 200%.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong> <strong>take regular breaks if you want to operate at your maximum capabilities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers-dont-exist">10X Engineers Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I thought that a great programmer is a person who knows tons of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Such a mindset only gave birth to my impostor syndrome. I thought that I don't deserve my current position, my salary, that I am a “fraud.” So I started to follow every popular developer on Twitter, read every technical news, and thousands of developer blogs just to convince myself that I deserve what I have and to feel more close to the title “great developer.”</p>
<p><strong>This was not a healthy behavior.</strong></p>
<p>But it helped me to discover that a lot of people I followed (I thought were 10X engineers) actually didn’t know a lot of things. They may know how to do some complex things that require a lot of different deep knowledge in a couple of fields and at the same time don’t know some primitive things. Like to know how to design highly scalable database architectures but don’t know how vertical-align an element with CSS.</p>
<p>Big thanks to those developers, like Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for <a target="_blank" href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/">this article</a>, they cured my imposter syndrome and showed me that it is okay not to know something.</p>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-hard-if-you-know-how-to-learn">Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn</h2>
<p>When I started to learn JavaScript, it was hard. <strong>Because I learned the wrong way.</strong></p>
<p>Read a lot of theory without the practice, no routine, no end goal. Chaos.</p>
<p>I thought it was normal to learn like this. Until I discovered <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a purposeful and systematic type of practice (learning).</p>
<p>The difference between normal practice and deliberate is that deliberate requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p>
<p>After I applied a deliberate practice, I began to notice how fast I'm progressing with learning JavaScript. My knowledge started to stick for a long time, not just for 5 minutes after tutorials. I created the end goal, why I am learning JavaScript, and understand what I need to learn, and what I don't.</p>
<p>📌 <em>Quick note: I’m creating a JavaScript course where I’m using deliberate practice to <strong>combine modern and practical JavaScript theory with a lot of real-world practice</strong> to teach you how to become a skilled JavaScript developer with knowledge of modern language features. <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptcoursethatworks.com/">Join here.</a></em></p>
<p>So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform at maximum effort:</strong> constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Well defined and specific goals:</strong> not just “overall improvement.”</li>
<li><strong>To be in focus:</strong> give your full attention, no distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Do conscious actions:</strong> no autopilot.</li>
<li><strong>Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-best-programming-language">There is no “best programming language”</h2>
<p>There is no <strong>best "something"</strong> in our world. Only <strong>best in something</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take cars. How can we choose the best car in the world? By speed? By safety? By what criteria?</p>
<p>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>We can only choose the best car in a certain category. Like the safest car. Or the best offroad car.</p>
<p>And if we look deeper, every category solves some problems.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We have children and we take them to school every day, we want our children to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the safest car.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We go camping every weekend, so we need some vehicle that can easily get us to places that are difficult to access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the best off-road car.</p>
<p>The same is with programming languages. Some languages and tools are better at solving some problems than others.</p>
<p>If we want to build an interactive website, we choose JavaScript.</p>
<p>If we want to go with ML/AI, we choose Python.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>there is no best programming language, there is the best programming language to ...</strong></p>
<p>So start with a problem first, then pick a language to solve it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Koyeb CLI (Command Line Interface) is now available and ready to let you manage all
your Koyeb resources directly from your shell! The Koyeb CLI is a
critical piece to improve the deployment experience and <strong>provide a fast way to
interact with Koyeb</strong> when you develop your projects.</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/illustrations/deploy-serverless-docker-containers-and-functions-with-koyeb-cli.svg" alt="CLI Demo"></p><p>As engineers, we spend hours using the terminal, that's why <strong>we designed the CLI to be as
simple and intuitive as possible</strong>. With the CLI, it's easy to automate and perform bulk
actions without leaving the terminal. This first release allows you to <strong>quickly deploy
Docker containers, configure Stacks and Secrets, invoke your functions, monitor
your executions</strong>, and much more!</p><p>In this post, we will check how to use the CLI to:</p><ul><li><a href="#deploy-and-run-docker-containers">Deploy and run Docker containers</a></li><li><a href="#deploy-python-and-nodejs-functions">Deploy Python and Node.js functions</a></li></ul><p>Let's get started and try some of the cool features!</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#getting-started"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="installation">Installation<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#installation"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Koyeb CLI is available as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/releases">pre-compiled

November 26, 2020 | https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://michel-slm.name/img/rex_ambassador.webp" alt="rex-ambassador"></p>
<h2 id="on-safety-razors">On safety razors</h2>
<p>I recently switched over from the ubiquitous cartridge razors to double-edge safety razors. The original impetus was not finding a non-charging base for my GiletteLabs Heated Razors - the battery in the stem made it too wide for most razor holders - and noticing that a lot of reviews swear by various safety razors.</p>
<p>I ended up buying the 
<a href="https://www.razoremporium.com/rex-supply-co-ambassador-adjustable-stainless-steel-de-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rex Ambassador</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> a few months ago - and then held off on actually using it, telling myself I need to learn how to properly use it first. In the end I told myself I would stop using my Gilette the day after the US Presidential Election, and start using the safety razor the morning after the US Presidential Election is finally called – which was Sunday the 8th, with a nice 5-day stubble to test it on.</p>
<p>The first shave went surprisingly smoothly; the next few shaves ended with some minor mishaps - cockiness and distraction getting in the way - but overall there is no way I’m going back to cartridge razors after this. Feeling more in control, getting a closer shave, no plastic waste to dispose – and hey much lower total cost of ownership!</p>
<h2 id="-and-technology">… and technology</h2>
<p>There seems to be a parallel here between the world of personal care and that of technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>most people are trapped on proprietary, heavily marketed solutions (cartridge razors, proprietary operating systems, apps and services)</li>
<li>these proprietary solutions are at first glance more user friendly</li>
<li>the more open solutions have a steeper learning curve but are eventually more empowering</li>
<li>vendor lock-in</li>
<li>the incentives for the manufacturers/vendors and customers/users are not aligned</li>
</ul>
<p>Think Windows on one side, vs Linux (and the BSDs) on the other (with macOS initially being in the middle and increasingly swaying to becoming even more constraining than Windows). Think proprietary gaming consoles and mobile IAP-chasing games, vs game platforms that 
<a href="https://fennel-lang.org/setup#making-games-with-fennel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage participation</a> like 
<a href="https://tic80.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TIC-80</a> and 
<a href="https://love2d.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LÖVE</a>. Think US-centric proprietary social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and services (Dropbox, Google Suite) vs distributed social networks (Mastodon, Pleroma, Diaspora etc.) and self-hosted services (Nextcloud, Cryptpad etc.).</p>
<p>What are most people sacrificing to the altar of promised convenience? Literally both time and money: our attention, higher costs; also our autonomy (you’re locked in) and our privacy (… so platform owners can mine your attention and monetize what they observe of your behavior).</p>
<p>If you believe in capitalism, this is bad news. If you don’t it’s even worse.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Part of the solution is regulatory. In the EU, 
<a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/eu-court-withdraw-personal-data-of-eu-citizens-from-us-cloud-services-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent ECJ ruling</a> requires EU companies to stop using US-based cloud services to host data from EU citizens. This could help push the adoption of more open, user-empowering, privacy-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>But in other jurisdictions like the US, regulation might be a long time coming, except maybe in California (plus the companies we’re trying to unshackle users from are mostly US-based). So a lot of the solution has to be bottom up.</p>
<p>We simply need to lower barriers to entry, both actual and perceived, to using the platforms we’re championing. Some involve compromises (e.g. 
<a href="https://flatpak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flatpak</a> is a great way to abstract away the differences between Linux distributions, to the point that 
<a href="https://flathub.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s easier to install proprietary apps</a>, including Steam – which improves the availability of games on Linux despite, yes, being proprietary). Some involve corporate backing (e.g. 
<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/lenovo-fedora-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora on Lenovo laptops</a>). A lot would involve being more welcoming to newcomers, and bridging the actual usability gaps there are.</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to overcome incumbency and the network effect. Let’s not make it harder for ourselves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Voice search or voice-enabled search is the means of searching by using the most natural input channel, human speech.</p><p><strong>TL;DR You can find a demo of voice search done right in the bottom of this article</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/voice-search-statistics/">20% of all Google App searches</a> are done by using voice and a nearly 40% of US internet users are using voice search features.</p><p>According to PwC research from 2018, consumers actually prefer voice over typing for searching. And this is no wonder: typing on a smart phone is not the nicest of tasks and more and more people are using internet primarily on a mobile device.</p><h2>Voice search is not available on most applications</h2><p>But when it comes to applications and websites, voice search is still rarely available. Why is that?</p><p>We did some small research on developer communities and found out that the <strong>number one reason for not adopting voice search</strong> is the lack of developer tools for doing that.</p><p>Search is a very valuable part of many applications and designers and developer teams use a lot of time to make it just right for the users. Users who search can be over three times more probable to convert than those who don't search.</p><blockquote><p>Developer tools for building voice search haven't previously been available</p></blockquote><p>This means getting users to search and most importantly to find what they are looking for is of immense value to any product team.</p><p>Smart speakers can help here: according to ComScore, half of online shoppers are using voice assistants to help them research products.</p><p>But like we've written many times, smart speakers and voice assistants are not the <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">holy grail of voice</a>. Actually far from it. Voice needs to be a part of applications to be really relevant.</p><h2>Differences of voice search and traditional search</h2><p>Voice search is not just regular search box that has a microphone button and a speech-to-text system. This approach would lead into a bad user experience and this is not how Google is doing it, either.</p><p>In fact, the reason why a lot of searches on Google are done by using voice is that they have developed their natural language understanding capabilities. If you are looking for population of the USA, you can just ask "What's the population of United States" and you'll get your answer.</p><p>We search differently by using voice and by typing. For example, voice searches are typically longer than their written counterparts and they are expressed in natural language.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up and learn how voice search can improve your key metrics</p></div></div></div><p>This has clear implications for voice search. While typing "Intel LGA1151 motherboards" to a search bar is a natural way for doing search by typing, uttering that out loud might prove difficult and probably saying something like "motherboards for new intel processors" might be a better way of expressing the same search by using voice.</p><p>While regular search can give valuable information on how the voice search should be implemented, it needs to be designed separately.</p><h2>How to do voice search right</h2><p>To get voice search right, it needs to support natural language. The experience must be natural and it should be as tightly integrated to the current user experience as possible. You don't want to add a voice assistant or a chatbot with a totally different user experience, but to complement your current search.</p><p>Speechly is the first developer tool that enables developers to add natural, real-time voice experience to their applications in a short amount of time.</p><p>Voice search done by using Speechly works on all platforms with a single configuration for consistent user experience, enables corrections by using speech and is easily integrated to the current user interface with minimal changes.</p><p>Here's a demo showing voice search done right.

<p>Many jokes have been made about the true nature of Emacs, such as it
being a fully-fledged operating system.  This talk will demonstrate
its suitability for playing retro games, then explore the inner
workings of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> emulator capable of smooth video game emulation.</p>

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

We tend to sit more and take less breaks than we would usually do in an office, and over time that takes a toll on our backs and necks. I thought I fixed this by buying a standing desk, but I was wrong. The problem is that I usually forget to raise the desk so I sit in my chair for more than an hour until I feel pain in my back, and that's when I remember that I should stand up. So how do I fix this? An alarm that would ring every hour would do just fine, but it's not very accurate. What if I'm not in the office? What if I'm working at night? Do I really want to spend time setting alarms? No!</p>
<p>I like to automate things so I found a solution for this as well. The only thing I had to do was to place a contact sensor under my chair, and each time I would sit down it would report its state to Home Assistant. From there on I could create whatever automation I wanted. In my case, after 50 minutes of sitting down, I'll have Alexa notify me that I must stand up, and insist every 5 minutes if I'm still sitting down. Here's how I did it.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-place-the-contact-sensor">Step 1: Place the contact sensor</h3>
<p>I found that when I sit on the chair, the seat will go down a bit, so I just need to find the perfect place for my contact sensor so that it will get close enough when I sit down. Also, I would like it to remain closed when I lean on my back, because that still counts as sitting down (and a bad position for my back). After a few trials I found the perfect position, here's how it looks for an Aeron chair.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605726474455/QzkPW8PnI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Contact sensor"></p>
<p>The small magnet can be glued on top of the chair using its original sticker and it will hold just fine. The best part is that you can hardly see them when you look from above, not that it would matter that much.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605726513434/djOgkYFR8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Aeron Chair"></p>
<h3 id="step-2-add-it-to-home-assistant">Step 2: Add it to Home Assistant</h3>
<p>This is where the fun begins. The first thing you have to do is to connect your sensor to Home Assistant, the way you do this depends on your hardware. In my case, I have a Conbee II so I have to pair my Zigbee sensor with it, then it will appear in Home Assistant as a Binary Sensor. I then created a template sensor just for fun. It has two states: "Sitting down" and "Standing up", here's how the code looks like:</p>
<p>I made a YouTube video where you can see how it works:</p>

<p>In California, the nation’s most populous state, 90% of students started the school year entirely online. When schools closed in March, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/20/governor-newsom-announces-cross-sector-partnerships-to-support-distance-learning-and-bridge-the-digital-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50% of low-income California students</a> lacked the necessary technology to access distance learning. Broader tech distribution was available for the 2020-21 school year thanks to donations from companies like HP, Lenovo, Amazon, Apple, T-Mobile, Microsoft, and Google. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey even personally donated $10 million to the city of Oakland’s tech initiative. With chromebooks and wifi hotspots now available for every student, California legislators and corporations congratulated themselves on closing the “<a href="https://time.com/4718032/the-digital-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital divide</a>.”</p>



<p>Despite their improved tech access, many students have more pressing material needs. Over <a href="https://www.usich.gov/homelessness-statistics/ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">260,000 California students</a> experience homelessness every year, and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20% of California children</a> live below the poverty line. The tech industry has not made massive donations to medical and therapy services, which low-income students often receive through community schools. Likewise, there is no private backing for the state’s free grab-and-go meals program.&nbsp;</p>



<div id="block_5f7a52ef09aad">
    <p>
		Distance learning is a sleight of hand. Framed as a panacea, online education is actually the vehicle for a long-desired economic restructuring.     </p>
</div>


<p>Online schooling will generate a treasure trove of data tech firms can buy and sell. Free meals will not. Silicon Valley boasts a yearly output of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/30/silicon-valley-wealth-second-richest-country-world-earth#:~:text=1%20year%20old-,If%20Silicon%20Valley%20were%20a%20country%2C%20it%20would,among%20the%20richest%20on%20Earth&amp;text=Were%20it%20real%2C%20the%20Sultanate,every%20nation%20on%20the%20planet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$275 billion</a> and has a GDP similar to that of Qatar. Yet California, the world’s fifth largest economy, is currently <a href="https://edsource.org/2020/guide-to-californias-budget-deferrals-pros-cons-and-costs-of-delayed-payments/634950#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20the%20minimum%20level,spending%20to%20last%20year's%20level." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withholding $11 billion</a> from schools. Districts have been given IOUs for state funding and will not be reimbursed until next year. In contrast, California billionaires increased their net worth by over <a href="https://health-access.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Billionaires-Report-release-6.28.20_updated.docx.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25.5%</a> ($175 billion) in the first three months of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students throughout California are now stuck at home in hot, crowded rooms that occasionally fill with wildfire smoke. <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/cb/cefelfacts.asp#:~:text=Basic%20Facts%E2%80%94California%20Language%20Census%3A%20Fall%202019&amp;text=The%201%2C148%2C024%20English%20learners%20constitute,than%20English%20in%20their%20homes." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19% of these students are English language learners</a> and <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/sr/cefspeced.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 13% of them have disabilities</a>. Every day on Zoom they fall more and more behind both academically and socially. In Los Angeles Unified, the state’s largest district, students are receiving <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012859-LAUSD-UTLA-Distance-Learning-Tentative-Agreement.html#document/p12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90-170 minutes</a> of daily live instruction (depending on their age), after which they are expected to do independent work. Compared to the traditional six- or seven-hour school day, online education is laughably inadequate.</p>



<p>In real time, teachers and families are watching important developmental windows close for vulnerable children. Meanwhile the California Democratic Party and its affiliates tout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZaXGMaeegM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual schooling as a solution</a> for mitigating COVID-19 transmission. This policy is the result of an alignment between the Democratic Party, corporate power, and a bureaucratic teachers’ union. The purpose of their alignment is to rationalize austerity and boost commercial profits. Distance learning is a sleight of hand. Framed as a panacea, online education is actually the vehicle for a long-desired economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>School Closures: An Unscientific and Regressive Policy&nbsp;</strong></h5>







<p>California’s introduction of online schooling was driven by financial concerns, not medical or moral ones. Reopening safely would have required physical distancing plans, distribution of face shields or masks, sanitizing supplies, systems for daily health screenings, regular testing, widespread use of outdoor spaces, alternative schedules, smaller class sizes, and a massive hiring initiative. The primary reason these proposals were shot down was not rising COVID-19 cases as the governor, Gavin Newsom, asserted. California cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have been <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19CasesDashboard_15931020425010/Cases?:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining since August 1</a>, but since then Newsom has only made <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reopening guidelines stricter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The full prohibition on in-person learning directly contradicts the advice of medical and scientific experts. In June the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/covid-19-planning-considerations-return-to-in-person-education-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued recommendations</a> for school re-openings, stating, “the AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.” The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/07/schools-should-prioritize-reopening-in-fall-2020-especially-for-grades-k-5-while-weighing-risks-and-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar guidance</a>. Schools, the authors argue, provide essential services to students and families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only <em>after</em> large school districts decided to stay closed did the AAP revise its original guidance to fit a perceived political consensus. Many clinical studies and reviews supported their original conclusion, demonstrating that children are <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/146/2/e2020004879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to transmit COVID-19</a> than adults, and school closures are an <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X/fulltext#seccestitle20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ineffective method of disease control</a>. Not only will these irrational closures deepen class disparities, the policy has also overruled some children’s civil right to public education—a right that became universal in federal law less than 50 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was not until 1975 that people with disabilities won a “Free and Appropriate Public Education” through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Before IDEA people with intellectual disabilities were often put in underfunded and abusive state schools, such as the infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpVEjzO6Dd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willowbrook state school in Staten Island</a>. Similarly, discrimination against English language learners was allowed until the 1974 passage of the Equal Education Opportunity Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dismantling these gains is apparently of no concern to the California Democrats and the California Teachers Association (CTA), the state teachers union. Virtual learning effectively limits educational access for high-need populations. Yet as public resources are funneled into online learning platforms, the CTA regularly claims to be <a href="https://californiaeducator.org/unionstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting back against billionaires</a> and politicians. In reality, the teachers union is acting as an astroturfing and financing arm of the tech industry and the Democratic Party. There is no real conflict between these entities because their interests are identical.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>The Teachers Union as Controlled Opposition</strong></h5>







<p>The wave of California teachers’ strikes in the 2018-19 school year may have left observers with the impression that the CTA is a robust union with a strong organizing focus. While recent changes in local and statewide leadership have sparked some collective actions, the union largely operates as a bureaucratic funding vehicle and promotion wing for the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The median teacher salary in California is <a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/public-school-teacher-salary/ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$65,252</a>. On average, <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/allocation-of-teacher-union-dues-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California teachers pay $1,072</a> in dues, and the majority of dues do not go to local organizations—they go to the CTA. In 2018 at least twelve CTA officers and directors made <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/940362310/10_2019_prefixes_92-95%2F940362310_201808_990O_2019101616751101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six-figure salaries</a>. The CTA president took home about $340,000, and the union’s Associate Executive Director over $1 million. It is extremely difficult for teachers to find out how much of their dues money goes to political activities, let alone which of these activities actually help secure better working conditions and wages for teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, some information is available. California teachers’ dues directly contribute to the CTA’s PAC. Although teachers can opt out from donating to the PAC, this option is only given when they sign the form to join the union. While there are limits to the CTA’s donations to individual candidates through its PAC, the CTA can donate greater amounts through <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/antonucci-california-school-unions-are-ramping-up-campaign-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent expenditure committees</a>. For example, the CTA’s PAC donated only $29,000 to Newsom’s election campaign in 2018, but its independent expenditure committee gave $1 million to “Education Organizations for Gavin Newsom for Governor 2018.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Education Association, which the CTA is a part of, is likewise opaque about how much dues money is used for political activities and what those activities are. In 2018 the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary?toprecipcycle=2020&amp;contribcycle=2020&amp;lobcycle=2020&amp;outspendcycle=2020&amp;id=d000000064&amp;topnumcycle=2018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEA contributed about $5.4 million</a> to candidates and political campaigns and spent close to $2.9 million on lobbying. After endorsing Joe Biden in March, the NEA now invites teachers to become “<a href="https://educationvotes.nea.org/become-an-educator-for-joe/?ms=spsHP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Educators for Joe</a>” through its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The relationship between the union and the California Democratic Party extends to the CTA’s organizing work for ballot initiatives. Most recently, local California unions have asked their members to <a href="https://www.cta.org/press-release/800-educators-kickoff-signature-gathering-for-schools-and-communities-first-initiative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collect signatures</a> and join rallies for Prop 15, the Students and Communities First Initiative. The slogan for Prop 15 is “Tax the Rich,” but the tax will not be on wealthy individuals, or directly on the revenue of California’s largest industries (tech, agriculture, tourism, and entertainment). The tax will instead be on <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_15,_Tax_on_Commercial_and_Industrial_Properties_for_Education_and_Local_Government_Funding_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business properties</a> exceeding $3 million in value. The initiative is backed by national politicians like <a href="https://twitter.com/Schools1stCA/status/1296273352638828546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2019/07/29/bernie-sanders-endorses-2020-california-initiative-to-change-how-commercial-and-industrial-properties-are-taxed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1180299303694286849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Buttigieg</a>, and <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11801979/bloomberg-endorses-measure-to-revise-prop-13-raise-commercial-property-taxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Bloomberg</a>. The Chan Zuckerberg foundation has contributed <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-engages-on-key-california-ballot-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $6.3 million</a> to support Prop 15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Union members should be concerned about the fact that, according to the <a href="https://www.cta.org/our-advocacy/scf/estimated-funding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CTA’s own Prop 15 calculator</a>, the plan will fund privately-operated charter schools in addition to public schools. Charter schools are property leasing schemes that exploit low-income communities for the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/04/why-hedge-funds-love-charter-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefit of investors</a>. In using public school teachers to organize for this funding, the CTA has promoted an initiative that will allow investment capital to benefit from industrial property taxes, an expense that <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/post-it/2020/09/prop-15-small-business-taxes-california-split-roll-property/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some worry</a> will fall on small businesses in the form of increased rents. Given the level of mismanagement, cronyism, and anti-teacher animus plaguing the administrations of many California school districts, it is also worth wondering if Prop 15 money will go where it is truly needed (staffing), or whether it will be wasted on more tech products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, there is no real tension between the political project of the teachers union and that of the Democratic Party. Both are working toward the same outcomes. In the case of COVID-19, the desired outcome is the purchase of hardware, software, and online learning subscriptions on an enormous scale. This ploy relies on a politics of …</p></div></div>

In this article, we discuss how we we manage to improve our front-end React app by shortening the loading time from approximately 30 seconds down to around 6 to 3 seconds.</p>
<h2>Our case</h2>
<p>We have a page known as the scenario editor page. In this page, a user can add, delete or modify what we call as steps, of a scenario. A step can be anything a user can do on the page, like for example: clicking a button, entering a value into a text field, visiting another web page, and so on.</p>

<p>Although we know that React is pretty fast by default<em>â€”</em>with its DOM diffing mechanism able to perform efficient updates only to the necessary nodes<em>â€”</em>some of our customers have so many steps in a single scenario making even such efficient rendering feels slow.</p>
<p>Yet, as this scenario page remains central to our usersâ€™ day-to-day life, we have to find a way to speed up the rendering time. Although the focus of this article is on the React side, we also made some improvements on the backend side, which we will discuss  in this article as well.</p>
<h2>First Step: Have a baseline</h2>
<p>Before going even further, itâ€™s almost always necessary to have some baseline to compare. To do that, we can simply take notes of the page load time for example. We can take 10 hard reload, and calculate the average load time. In some cases, we measured the memory consumption as well. This simple step really doesnâ€™t take more than just a pen and paper to do.</p>
<h2>Optimizing Queries</h2>
<p>After establishing some baseline, we go stright at finding ways we can do to optimize our front-end application. We asked ourselves: why is the rendering so slow? There can be many reasons, and sometimes itâ€™s confusing where to look at first.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have been using an App Performance Monitoring (APM) tools, such as New Relic and Scout APM, for quite awhile. This was a good starting point. By utilizing it, we were able to point out that we were frequently sending queries on a table having no index for the column we used for filtering. That resulted in a whole-table scan making executing the query considerably slower.</p>
<p>So the fix was simply by adding an index on those fields! Easy fix, easy gain. Right? Thanks to the APM tools.</p>
<p>But wait, shouldnâ€™t we always use the ID field, designated with primary key, for filtering out the data? Yes, but, there are cases where we donâ€™t want to use the primary key. For instance, letâ€™s imagine we allowed our admin to list scenarios belonging to any given <code>username</code> as it is easier to remember a username than an ID. Thus, the query for that request wonâ€™t use the tableâ€™s ID column, but the <code>username</code>.</p>
<p>On top of that, we should never perform this kind of query:</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>scenarios <span>=</span> <span>Scenario</span>
  <span>.</span>joins<span>(</span><span>:tags</span><span>)</span>
  <span>.</span>where<span>(</span><span>"tags.name ILIKE ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>"%<span><span>#{</span>tags<span>}</span></span>%"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Can you guess why shouldnâ€™t we issue such a query?</p>
<p>Yes! It is because searching off based on a string will never be as fast as the following codes:</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>scenarios <span>=</span> <span>Scenario</span><span>.</span>where<span>(</span>tag<span>:</span> <span>Tag</span><span>.</span>find<span>(</span>tag_id<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The query above is much faster, as we are using the primary key of the <em>tag</em>. No string scanning is needed, thus itâ€™s much more optimized.</p>
<p>At the end, we managed to shorten query execution time from 5~7 seconds down to the neighborhood of 500ms for certain scenarios.</p>
<h2>Avoiding N+1</h2>
<p>Do you believe that we achieved between 39% to 60% speed improvement just by avoiding N+1 queries? That translate to a speed improvement from 16.39 second to around 6.91 second, when the scenario page contains 200 steps.</p>
<p>How did we do that? We used Chrome Dev Tools to discover that we send an HTTP request for each step one-by-one. Why did we do that is because we would like to retrieve additional metadata given a stepâ€™s ID.</p>
<p>This kind of problem is called <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/06/09/n-plus-one-queries-explained.html">N+1 query issue</a>. Sending a request one by one is almost certainly never a good idea. So, we fixed this issue by sending only one request to retrieve all the metadata. Even better, we further improved it by having the metadata embedded on the pageâ€™s DOM structure so that we donâ€™t have to send another request just to have it.</p>
<h2>Hacking the shouldComponentUpdate and friends</h2>
<p>In the scenario editor page, we have a parent Board component containing many (or zero) <code>Row</code> components. Each <code>Row</code> eventually renders each <code>Step</code> component. A Step component itself has a <code>StepEditor</code> where user can customize or edit some values. An illustration of a step having its editor panel shown, is as follows:</p>

<p>As we can see, within the <code>StepEditor</code> panel, users can customize some data such as by adding a memo field, or by changing the selected value for the <code>When this step fail</code> select box. When they make such changes, our front-end app infrastructure have the changes propagates back up to the parent <code>Board</code> component, as illustrated by the following tree image.</p>

<p>Eventually, React decided to re-render the whole component for any slight changes on our front-end application. This is due to some design decision, indeed.</p>
<p><span>

<p>However, some <code>Row</code> certainly donâ€™t need to be re-rendered, right? So, how can we make the rendering more efficient?</p>
<p>To do that, we dictated the behavior of <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> by returning <code>false</code> in the <code>Step</code> component, when we believe it doesnâ€™t have to update. This way, we can use certain logic to check if the <code>Step</code> needs to re-render. However, this technique should be done carefully, as itâ€™s very error-prone, since we are the one who direct React when it should or should not render the component. If we put the <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> in higher up the node, then all of its children wonâ€™t re-render if it returns <code>false</code>. Therefore, this should be done really carefully.</p>
<p>Perhaps, before overriding <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>, you may want to try giving child elements a <code>key</code> attribute. This isnâ€™t exactly the same technique, but it helps React recognize whether or not thereâ€™s a new leaf to render. This is especially useful and beneficial if the elements are rendered dynamically, for example <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html">when rendering a list</a> for each item in an array.</p>
<h2>Understanding now and later</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an asynchronous language. It helps if we understand the so pronounced difference between the <em>now</em> and <em>later</em> in its event looping system.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, a <em>later</em> does not have to happen immediately after <em>now</em>. That is, the <em>now</em> is not necessarily blocking the <em>later</em>. That might sounds abstract and philosophical, but perhaps it is easier to observe by using codes. So, please take a look at the following JavaScript snippet:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> scenarioData <span>=</span> <span>ajax</span><span>(</span><span>"https://autify.com/scenarios/1.json"</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>scenarioData<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In JavaScript, itâ€™s definitely bound to happen that by the time we reach the second line, <code>scenarioData</code> is still <code>undefined</code> , and that is what is going to be printed to the console. That is, the second line is executed without waiting for the first line to be executed in its entirety.</p>
<p>Internally, we may be able to conceptualize JavaScript through the following oversimplified codes:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> event

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>futureEvents</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>length <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        event <span>=</span> <span>futureEvents</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each iteration of the loop above is called a <em>tick</em>, within which an <em>event</em> is taken off the queue if there is any, and then executed. Those events are all <em>later</em> things that should become <em>now</em> in our JavaScript codes. As such, the correct way to print the <code>scenarioData</code> is to put this into the tick just after the ajax request completes, or by having a <em>then</em> callback:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>ajax</span><span>(</span><span>"https://autify.com/scenarios/1.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>scenarioData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>scenarioData<span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can capitalize this knowledge further by asking ourselves: If JavaScript sees the world as events occurring one after another, where the <em>later</em> does not mean rightly after <em>now</em>, and the <em>now</em> doesnâ€™t mean it will block: can we postpone expensive operations for, simply, 1 millisecond <em>later</em>?</p>
<p>So, instead of the following code:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Form.Check</span></span> <span>inline</span>
    <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-secondary<span>"</span></span>
    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>checkbox<span>"</span></span>
    <span>checked</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span> <span>!</span><span>!</span>continuesOnFailure <span>}</span></span>
    <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>onContinueOnFailureChange</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>continueOnFailure<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We request that the change be executed in the next tick (also turning this component from a controlled component to become an uncontrolled one):</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Form.Check</span></span> <span>inline</span>
    <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-secondary<span>"</span></span>
    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>checkbox<span>"</span></span>
    <span>defaultChecked</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span> <span>!</span><span>!</span>continuesOnFailure <span>}</span></span>
    <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>onContinueOnFailureChange</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>continueOnFailure<span>)</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And yes! With that change, a user clicking on a checkbox will see the change takes effect immediately, instead of waiting for React to re-render 200 strong components so that the toggle turned into the checked state. Instead, what will happen is: the toggle get checked, and React re-render. Or technically speaking, since the change is registered in the next tick, users will see the change in the checkbox first, as the change callback is executed in the next <em>tick</em>. This makes the user experience feels more snappier and faster.</p>
<p>In some case, we even nest <code>setTimeout</code> within <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span>stepsDataUrl<span>)</span>
	<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>response</span> <span>=&gt;</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    	<span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>hideSpinner</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
    	<span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>showMessage</span><span>(</span><span>"Scenario saved successfully"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
        
    	<span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>setSteps</span><span>(</span>data<span>.</span>steps<span>)</span><span>)</span>
            
            <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>closeAllDetailPanel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is important to note that <code>setTimeout</code> does not actually put our callback on the event loop queue. It just set up a timer, and when the timer expires, the environment places our callback back into the event loop, such that in some future <em>tick</em>, the JavaScript engine will execute the event.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>setTimeout</code> may not fire our event with a perfect temporal accuracyâ€”that is, there is no guarantee that our callback is fired …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Do your players long for the exhilarating sensation of controlling a whole city?</p><p>From popular games like&nbsp;<em>Sim City&nbsp;</em>to lesser-known indie games like <em>Banished</em>, city-building games are an immensely popular sub-genre of strategy. Not only are they beloved by players, but they also present developers with a special challenge in terms of game design. Despite all the under the hood math involved, though, they can also be a great first choice of game for a beginner to create on their own!</p><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be creating the foundations of a city-building game in Unity. This project will feature a versatile camera controller, different buildings that can be placed, population/job/food simulations, and even a UI to tie it all together. By the end, you’ll be able to easily add in new buildings since we’re going to be using <strong>scriptable objects</strong>. So if you’re ready to develop your own city-building game from scratch, let’s get started.</p><p><img src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg" alt="the complete city builder game" width="1611" height="906" srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg 1611w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1611px) 100vw, 1611px" data-srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg 1611w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1536x864.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg.webp 1611w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1024x576.jpg.webp 1024w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1536x864.jpg.webp 1536w"></p><h3><span id="Project_Files"></span>Project Files<span></span></h3><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be needing some assets such as 3D models and textures.</p><ul><li>Download the required assets here.</li><li>Download the complete project here.</li></ul><div><div id="product_countdown_shortcode" data-until_seconds="5206s" data-dates_to="1606694400" data-fade="0" data-labels_years="Years" data-labels_months="Months" data-labels_weeks="Weeks" data-labels_days="Days" data-labels_hours="Hours" data-labels_minutes="Minutes" data-labels_seconds="Seconds" data-labels_year="Year" data-labels_month="Month" data-labels_week="Week" data-labels_day="Day" data-labels_hour="Hour" data-labels_minute="Minute" data-labels_second="Second" data-display_from_top="0"><div><p><span></span><span>Don't miss out!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>For many years now, <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/categories/nas-build/" title="Brian's DIY NAS Build Blogs">I’ve been building, blogging, and giving away DIY network-attached storage (NAS) builds</a>. I was started down this path when I couldn’t find a relevant and recent build parts list to follow when I built <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2012/01/do-it-yourself-network-attached-storage.html" title="Building a NAS: Choosing Hardware">my first DIY NAS</a> back in 2012. In blogging about my own experience building my NAS, I surprisingly find myself atop Google’s search rankings for search terms like “DIY NAS”. Ever since, I’ve been regularly building and blogging about my different DIY NAS builds. My perpetual hope is to encourage potential DIY NAS enthusiasts to build and design their own custom DIY NAS solutions.</p>
<p><span data-pullquote="Well I guess I have to build an even more bananas AMD DIY NAS now, don’t I?!">
When I got done with <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/03/diy-nas-2019-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2019 Edition">last year’s DIY NAS build</a>, I thought that I had built the most bananas over-the-top DIY NAS build that I could possibly imagine. Upon finishing it, I committed to myself that the 2020 DIY NAS build would be far more restrained.</span></p>
<p>But then I built my <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/11/diy-nas-econonas-2019.html" title="DIY NAS: 2019 EconoNAS">first AMD-based DIY NAS, the 2019 EconoNAS</a>, and in building that NAS I realized that the extreme flexibility of AMD’s CPU architecture was suited quite well for DIY NAS enthusiasts to take advantage of. When I published last year’s EconoNAS blog, I remarked to myself, Well I guess I have to build an even more bananas AMD DIY NAS now, don’t I?!
</p>
<h3>And then 2020 happened…</h3>
<p>…and thankfully my wife, son, and I remained healthy—something I wish for all of you too. As a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type1.html" title="Type 1 Diabetes">Type 1 Diabetic</a>, I’m among the highest risk for bad outcomes. As I began working from home, I thought I’d be able to spend a few of the weekly hours that I spent commuting working on blogs instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/covid-19_150.jpg">But what I found was the opposite—surviving a pandemic, being a productive remote worker, plus trying to help keep an eye on my feral 4-year-old son was a tremendous energy drain. I did my best to emulate my amazing wife and focused my efforts on our household, and unfortunately the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em> suffered for it.</p>
<p>All of the hardware that I’d purchased so far languished in my “other office” while I re-acclimated to this new normal!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve ordered anything online recently, you’ve certainly noticed that COVID-19 has disrupted a lot of the availability of items. This is especially true of the components in the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em>. I was disappointed to see how much of it has been difficult to find in stock. If you decide to emulate this build, please use the comments below and help each other out in finding vendors with the parts in stock—or suitable replacements for hard-to-find components!</p></blockquote>
<h2>Case and Power Supply</h2>

Especially with my preference for smaller motherboards and integrated CPUs. But this year is different! In late 2019, <a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/">SilverStone</a> contacted me and asked if I’d review the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a> (<a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=861&amp;area=en" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B Specifications">specs</a>) if they sent one to me.</p>

There’s room in the case for a total of 12 different hard disk drives. With 8 of those hard drives being accessible in hot-swap drive bays. The case accommodates Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, and Mini-DTX motherboards. While I prefer smaller cases for my DIY NAS builds, the CS381 is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a large case by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, its bigger footprint allows it to accommodate cards up to 267mm or even a 240mm radiator for a water-cooling setup.</p>
<p>Of the many components in the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em>, I’ve been most excited about getting my hands on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a>.

I’d much rather use a couple zip ties to manage an extraneous power cord or two, rather than have to dig around my office months—or even years—down the road to find where I stored the extra cables. Unfortunately for me there just wasn’t any non-modular option within what I was shopping for. I would’ve considered spending an extra $5-10 for a non-modular option.</p>
<h2>Motherboard, CPU, and CPU Cooler</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-X570-4DDR4-HDMI-Motherboard/dp/B07THYPNC1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=004553e0116e3ba58f4361cfb65039ea&amp;language=en_US" title="ASRock X570M Pro4"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/mobo_150.jpg"></a>One of the things that I was most excited about after selecting the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a> as the case was the additional motherboards that I’d get to shop for. Being able to include Micro-ATX motherboards more than doubled the number of motherboards that met the criteria of what I feel is important for a DIY NAS build. Since I’d already decided I wanted to build a DIY NAS with an AMD CPU and that I’d picked out a case that could support up to 12 hard disk drives, my ideal criteria for the motherboard was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mini-ITX or Micro-ATX</li>
<li>AMD AMD4 CPU Socket</li>
<li>Support for 12 SATA Devices</li>
<li>Documented support for ECC RAM</li>
<li>Support for M.2 SSD(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the criteria, I knew that the 12 SATA devices and the documented support of ECC RAM would present the biggest challenge. While the AMD Ryzen CPUs support ECC RAM, it’s not necessarily implemented on all of the motherboards nor is it really something that the motherboard’s marketing departments have put a lot of effort including in their marketing materials. In doing my research, the best point of advice I read was to read reviews of the motherboards and focus on whether they tested the ECC functionality.</p>
<p>In regards to the SATA devices, I knew that I wasn’t going to find a motherboard that supported 12 SATA devices—especially at a “reasonable” price point. Moreover, I also wanted to use M.2 SSD(s) for the operating system, and that typically knocks out the use of some of the available SATA controllers on the motherboard.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, I very quickly narrowed in on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-X570-4DDR4-HDMI-Motherboard/dp/B07THYPNC1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=004553e0116e3ba58f4361cfb65039ea&amp;language=en_US" title="ASRock X570M Pro4">ASRock X570M Pro4</a> motherboard (<a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X570M%20Pro4/" title="ASRock X570M Pro4 Specifications">specs</a>). In reading about the motherboard, I was confident it supported ECC RAM, and I liked that it had enough onboard SATA to support the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381’s</a> 8 hot-swap bays. The motherboard very nearly met all of my ideal criteria by itself and at a fairly reasonable price. The only criteria it wasn’t able to meet—support to fill up all of the case’s internal and external drive bays—would get handled in the rest of my hardware purchases.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/cpu_150.jpg"></a>In building a bananas AMD NAS, I instantly scrolled to the top of AMD’s processor offerings and observed to myself, “Now that’s just a bit TOO bananas, Brian.” But in doing a bit of browsing of <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html">benchmarks of high-end CPUs</a>, I was drawn to the price-to-performance of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a> (<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3900x" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X Specifications">specs</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, whatever way you slice it, the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a> is complete and absolute overkill for the processing power needs of NAS. The selection of this processor really makes the machine capable of much more than just being a NAS. I’d encourage people who follow this blueprint to fully leverage the extra processing power to experiment with virtualization and host things that complement the storage capabilities.</p>

The 105W TDP of the CPU convinced me that I’d need to make sure to pack the most amount of cooling in the space I was allowed.</p>
<h2>RAM</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078N7HC6L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=531e96513bb9494ee79450dfca94d61f&amp;language=en_US" title="Crucial 16GB DDR4 DIMM 2666 MHz / PC4-21300 ECC (CT16G4WFD8266)"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/ram_100.jpg"></a>Very little expense was spared in the building of the <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/03/diy-nas-2019-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2019 Edition">DIY NAS: 2019 Edition</a>, but in building it I intentionally saved a few dollars by going with the bare minimum in recommended RAM. In fact, had I experienced any difficulty in the benchmarking of the NAS, I was ready to buy more RAM and talk about both of those decisions.</p>
<p>In making sure this year’s DIY NAS was more bananas than the prior year’s significantly upgrading the RAM was a no-brainer for me. I picked two <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078N7HC6L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=531e96513bb9494ee79450dfca94d61f&amp;language=en_US" title="Crucial 16GB DDR4 DIMM 2666 MHz / PC4-21300 ECC (CT16G4WFD8266)">16GB DIMMs of DDR4 2666MHz PC4-21300 Unbuffered ECC RAM</a> (<a href="https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/ct16g4wfd8266" title="Crucial 16GB DDR4 DIMM 2666 MHz / PC4-21300 ECC (CT16G4WFD8266) Specifications">specs</a>) for the DIY NAS: 2020 Edition. A total of 32 GB of RAM would be sufficient for the needs of this year’s DIY NAS build, although I would advise the virtual machine enthusiast to consider more, depending on the number and workload of virtual machines they plan to run.</p>
<p>In this year’s DIY NAS, I’d also think that RAM would be one of the places where you’d see some opportunity to find savings. With my prior builds, especially the EconoNAS builds, I’ve been routinely pleased with how everything performs when using RAM that’s at the minimum side of the hardware recommendations.</p>
<h2>Host Bus Adapter and Cables</h2>

My ideal motherboard likely doesn’t exist or comes with such a price tag, that I’d never even consider it. Rather than try and find that motherboard, I opted to add a host bus adapter (HBA) to add support for the additional devices that I wanted the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em> to support. I chose an <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/IBM-Serveraid-M1015-Controller-46M0831/dp/B0034DMSO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=a416c9151a1a85f531aa0ee1a60d4e5d&amp;language=en_US" title="IBM Serveraid M1015 SAS/SATA Controller 46M0831">IBM M1015</a> (<a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/0/877/ENUSZG09-0870/ENUSZG09-0870.PDF" title="IBM Serveraid M1015 SAS/SATA Controller 46M0831 Specifications">specs</a>) to add those additional drives. The IBM M1015 is widely recommended for use with FreeNAS/TrueNAS, once you reflash its firmware, and adds support for an additional 8 SATA devices.</p>

<p>European defense ministers did not expect to be chatting with Daniël Verlaan when they logged into what they thought was a confidential video conference. </p>



<p>Using login information shared on one of the defense ministers' Twitter accounts, the Dutch 31-year-old reporter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-reporter-gatecrashes-eu-defense-ministers-videoconference/">gatecrashed their meeting on Friday</a>, creating a moment of comic relief — combined with a security alert — at a meeting where a classified document on threats facing the EU was on the agenda.</p>



<p>"I don't think I look like a spy. So I understand why ministers were laughing," Verlaan, who works for Dutch media outlet RTL Nieuws, told POLITICO in a call Monday.</p>



<p>The incident exposed problems with the tools that European officials have used to carry on their work during the coronavirus pandemic. It also raises questions about how slowly the Council of the EU has moved to roll out secure conferencing, eight months into the pandemic.</p>



<p>"The fact that you're a minister of defense doesn't mean you're a cybersecurity expert," Verlaan said. "Everyone can make this mistake and that's why I think it's so important to warn people about this."</p>



<h3>Joining the call</h3>



<p>Across the world, governments have struggled to adapt to new platforms and systems, with troubling and embarrassing incidents along the way. In March U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52152025" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> of the "first ever digital" cabinet meeting on Zoom, divulging what security experts said was sensitive information. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53667664" target="_blank">Court hearings</a>, <a href="https://threatpost.com/zoom-bombing-attack-hits-u-s-government-meeting/154903/" target="_blank">parliamentary sessions</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/09/829265445/zoombombing-city-hall-the-struggle-to-keep-public-meetings-going-virtually?t=1606124710773" target="_blank">local government meetings</a> have also fallen victim to poor security practices and unwanted intrusions this year.</p>



<p>In Friday's incident, a member of Dutch Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld's staff <a href="https://twitter.com/danielverlaan/status/1329799677827551233/photo/1" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> containing the web address of the meeting. The URL displayed the meeting ID and five of the six digits needed to access the meeting. </p>



<p>After receiving a tip about the vulnerability, Verlaan and a political reporter at RTL contacted the Dutch government and were told the meeting was still secure because the Council verified specific participants via webcam before allowing them to join, he said. </p>



<p>Verlaan decided to call the bluff. "I entered the URL, clicked okay and saw a screen asking for a pin code. The first five I knew, I entered them and added a '1,' then a '2' and eventually I bumped into the meeting," he said.</p>



<p>Footage obtained by POLITICO showed Verlaan in a large window at the top of the videoconference screen, dressed in a black T-shirt, grinning and waving to the ministers — some of whom laughed off the breach — as EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told him in a brief exchange he should leave immediately.</p>

<p>The incident puts a spotlight on the EU Council's security practices, as the EU institution is forced to discuss issues of defense, security, trade and other sensitive topics on platforms it acknowledges to be unsafe.</p>



<p>"We have all the time been conscious of, and have warned that, videoconferences ... are vulnerable from a security point of view," a Council official told POLITICO Friday, adding this was one reason they are "not formal Council meetings and no classified matters can be discussed."</p>



<p>"In September this year, the General Secretariat of the Council proposed the introduction of a new and more secure videoconference system, which is currently being&nbsp;considered by member states," the official said.</p>



<p>The fact that the meeting's URL contained the login information should be a cause for concern, Verlaan said.</p>



<h3>'I do illegal things for my job'</h3>



<p>The incident could have consequences for Verlaan. The Council official said the "intrusion" was illegal and "will be reported to the authorities."</p>



<p>As of Monday, the Dutch journalist said he had not heard from law enforcement. A Council official declined to say whether Verlaan had been reported to the authorities. The Dutch ministry of defense deferred questions about potential legal steps to the EU.</p>



<p>Either way, Verlaan is aware of the legal implications his reporting can have, he said.</p>



<p>"I regularly do illegal things for my job because I have to demonstrate that something is wrong, that there is misconduct or something is amiss," he said. "For example, take a company that got hacked and whose data is online: It's illegal to access that data, but at the same time I have to verify this data and inform the company about what data leaked."</p>



<p>Earlier this month Verlaan <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5195897/erasmusbrug-gehackt-verlichting-kleurtje-roze" target="_blank">got access</a> to the IT infrastructure of a bridge in Rotterdam and managed to change the lighting on the bridge, due to a vulnerability in how the bridge was connected to the internet. In October he <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5187220/jeugdriagg-kenter-jeugdhulp-datalek-dossiers" target="_blank">gained access</a> to medical files of minors who underwent psychotherapy due to a failure to properly secure an old website ran by a Dutch health care organization.</p>



<p>Verlaan said his reporting was always backed by RTL's editorial management and its legal service. But he added that he had not sought clearance beforehand for intrusion into the EU defense ministers' meeting  because he was just checking if authorities had been truthful about the security settings.</p>



<p>"By demonstrating, in a light-hearted way, an inoffensive way, a problem that's actually serious, I feel that's the best way to create awareness about the dangers online," he said.</p>

It was also circulated to students directly.</p>  <p>"I am extremely disappointed to tell you that there were over 100 cases of cheating," said the note, a screenshot of which was posted to the UBC Reddit&nbsp;thread.</p>  <p>"If confirmed, the students involved will receive a 0% for the course (not just the midterm) and I will recommend their expulsion from UBC."</p>  <p>The note is signed "Mike." The CBC has not been able to verify the UBC professor's identity. However,&nbsp;the university has said it's investigating allegations of widespread cheating&nbsp;in one section of the math department involving entry-level math students.</p>    <p>There are more than 1,500 students currently enrolled in Math 100 at UBC, split up into classes of about 250.&nbsp;The class is being held&nbsp;entirely online this semester, due to the pandemic. Midterms&nbsp;are&nbsp;run online as well.</p>  <p>Matthew Ramsey, director of university affairs, confirmed the university is investigating allegations of widespread cheating. He said it&nbsp;is&nbsp;too early to be able to provide details on how the students might have been cheating or how they were caught.</p>  <p>"Those details, I'm sure, will come clear in the investigative process," he said by phone on Tuesday.</p>  <p>Ramsey said the professor's note was first sent to students, then posted online.</p>  <h2>Test monitoring tools</h2>  <p>Many schools across the country, including UBC, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/exam-surveillance-software-university-ottawa-1.5633134" target="_blank">have been using online software extensions</a>&nbsp;to help detect and discourage cheating since classes went virtual.&nbsp;One test-proctoring tool, called&nbsp;Proctorio, monitors students for suspicious behaviour while they're writing a virtual exam.</p>  <p>UBC faculty can&nbsp;offer an alternative, like a final project, to replace exams if they are overly concerned about cheating, but exams can't always be replaced.</p>  <p>"In&nbsp;some instances, it is necessary to use ...&nbsp;software like Proctorio to ensure academic integrity," Ramsey said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Incidents of academic misconduct themselves are very uncommon, very rare at the university," added Ramsey, who has been with the school since 2014.&nbsp;"I have not seen allegations of this nature in my time at UBC&nbsp;but, again, they are, at this point, allegations."</p>    <p>Investigations into academic misconduct&nbsp;begin&nbsp;with a professor reporting their concerns to the dean's office. That office can either dismiss&nbsp;complaints, give students a warning or pass the case along to the&nbsp;President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline for potential punishment.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Penalties can range from a formal warning to being expelled from the university.</p>  <p>Since investigations are complex and take time, Ramsey said, it's&nbsp;too soon to gauge&nbsp;whether there has been an overall increase in cheating since classes and exams began moving fully&nbsp;online in the spring.</p>  <p>"If the students are disciplined, we will get a sense as to those numbers in the coming months. At this point, it's just too early to say," he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peeking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) <a href="https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1321102111883579397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months.

<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.

This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.

<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.

The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.

<p>
The white point is a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant">standard illuminate</a>  not intrinsic to the value of a color. It is an additional piece of information you provide to functions when converting into and out of the CIELAB colorspace.
</p>

<p>
The standard white point is defined as <code>d65</code> – in this section, every conversion will be made with <code>d65</code>. Here is a table of commonly used white points and their meaning (for values, see the bottom of the wikipedia link).

The knobs A and B allow you to play with the 4 primary colors of the LAB space. If you take a look at the values, you might notice that the more negative we go, we get "cooler" colors, while on the positive end, we get "warmer" colors.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some LAB colors. The labels below will have the values of  <code>(L A B)</code> – Remember, A is green to red, B is blue to yellow (each with a value -100 to 100)

LCH is a "cylindrical" version of cieLAB. What that means for us is that Hue is different. Instead of 6 defined islands to sail to with our color compass, there are 4:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 90°</p>
<p>green, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 270°</p>

<p>
LCH lightness:
</p>
 


<p> LCH: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), chromacity 50%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Chromacity, "distance from gray" - very similar to Saturation (which I've seen cited as simply misnamed chromacity):
</p>

 


<p> LCH: chromacity scale 0-100% (step 10%), luminance 70%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Let's compare some spaces. We'll take some the RGB gradient from above, normalize the lightness in HSLuv and then maximize l[C]h, H[S]L, and H[S]Luv:
</p>

 


<p> original </p> 


 


<p> squash lightness to 50 in HSLuv </p>

For text, the Web Content Assembly Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">link</a>. Let's take a look at some different text contrasts! I will steal the backgrounds used here from the base-16 grayscale sets: <code>#f7f7f7</code> and <code>#101010</code>. For reference, the contrast ratio between <code>#000000</code> and <code>#ffffff</code> is 21.0

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:

<p>
Color distance is useful because it lets us measure a kind of similarity between colors. You can use this to control where you stop transformations (color space property tweaks).

A gradient is where you travel from one color's initial property values to some other color's property values, collecting the intermediate steps.

<p>I recently graduated, and in order to get my official graduation title I needed to get my private and public key from the government. <strong>That’s right, you go to the government’s office, certify that you are who you are, and you’ll get a private and public key in an USB key from the government</strong> which you can use to do all your bureaucracy.</p>

<p>You also get a TaxID which is comprised of</p>

<p><img src="https://danielsada.tech/images/blog/rfc.png" alt="An image explaining the structure of RFC, the Mexican Tax ID."></p>

<p>With this key you can:</p>



<p>Want to get your passport? Sign in with your private key and password to the government portal and get it. Want your birth certificate? Get it online with your private key. Want to check your scholarship or any related paperwork? Just login online. This has made Mexican bureaucracy really good for the amount of people it handles. It specially astonishes me that it is instant, compared to most of the paperwork in the US which you have to mail stuff and it’s in ten thousand different places.</p>

<h2 id="get-your-digitally-signed-university-diploma">Get your digitally signed university diploma.</h2>

<p>You enter your key via a web portal, and you can then get a signed copy of your university diploma by the government, which then links to a public government page which certifies you are the holder of that diploma. You can use this to certify that someone is a doctor, or lawyer or whatever with this system. I can also print as many university diplomas from the government portal whenever I want, as they are just a digitally signed sheet of paper (with a QR with the public key).</p>

<h2 id="create-signed-invoices-of-goods-and-services-pay-taxes">Create signed invoices of goods and services &amp; pay taxes</h2>

<p>With your keys, you can also sign your invoices and guarantee that it is you who created them, and when you create a transaction, it automatically goes into the recipient’s Tax ID. That means, that at the end of the year, I just login into the government portal/whatever software I like, and it <strong>automatically calculates how many taxes I have to pay</strong>. I can also login with my key into the government’s website and pay my taxes with it.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-created-this-post">Why I created this post?</h2>

<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus">social security numbers are not ideal</a> and some of the government bureaucracy in the US still requires mail or checks or a physical office, this is merely inspiration or information hoping for something better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p><em>I consider the phenomenon of “Golden Handcuffs”, first as corporate perks, then as pay, then as Silicon Valley’s cost of living. I reject every explanation.</em></p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks</h3><p>You get kombucha on tap, organic granola, a masseuse on staff. Soon enough, you forget your passions, get comfortable, and never leave.</p>
<p>I hear this all the time, but it doesn’t actually add up.</p>
<p>After a few years, an engineer at Google is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.levels.fyi/">making around $350,000</a>. In contrast, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Remedy-Raw-Organic-Kombucha-Sparkling/dp/B07W7V7DRZ/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kombucha&amp;qid=1606035999&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-12">organic kombucha is $0.14 an ounce</a>. So even if you’re drinking 12 ounces a day 240 days a year [1], that’s just $400, or 0.1% of total compensation. To frame that otherwise, one year’s salary could buy you a 1000 year supply of kombucha.</p>
<p>What about the other perks? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/pages/about">Google’s granola supplier</a> sells to the public for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/products/the-original?variant=13611271782490">$7.20 a pound</a>. I don’t think it’s reasonable to eat a pound of granola day, but if you really wanted to, it would still only cost $1,700 for 240 work days. A nice massage is maybe $100, so if you go once a month, that’s another $1,200. Lunch is a pretty big cost, say $20 per day, or $4,800 per year.</p>
<p>What about your home office? The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-office-chair/">Wirecutter office chair</a> is $1000, their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">4k monitor</a> is $500, and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://top-line/">top-line 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is $4,500.</p>
<p>So that’s an annual cost of $8,100, or just 2.3% of total compensation. Plus an upfront cost of $6000, amortized over several years.</p>
<p>I have a really hard time believing this is why people fail to quit large companies.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay</h3><p>If perks represent only a tiny fraction of total compensation, then surely it’s the compensation itself that’s keeping employees in check?</p>
<p>This also ends up being tough to swallow.</p>
<p>Let’s say you quit your job, apply to Y Combinator, get in, pitch at demo day, and raise a Series A. Great news! You now have millions of dollars in the bank and can pay yourself a market rate salary again.</p>
<p>The odds that things do not go this smoothly are <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">maybe 99-to-1 if you’re a randomly sampled founder</a>. [2]</p>
<p>So let’s say you’re screwed and earn nothing as a founder. What’s the opportunity cost? Well in that year, it’s the full $350,000, or 100% of total compensation. But over your lifetime, the opportunity cost of taking a year off to pursue your dream is just 1 year out of a 40 year career. Around 2.5% of lifetime earnings. [3]</p>
<p>Is it not worth paying 2.5% of lifetime earnings to give your passion an earnest attempt? If you truly believed in something, would you really be unwilling to sacrifice even a miniscule fraction of all future income?</p>
<p>I’m sure this is part of the explanation, but it can’t be more than a small piece.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living" title="Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/09/01/silicon-valley-is-changing-and-its-lead-over-other-tech-hubs-narrowing">Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are you supposed to have a startup in a garage if the garage costs millions of dollars?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a great one-liner, but it’s also garbage logic. Sure, home sale prices are in the millions, but if you just want to rent a garage, he’s off by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=5&amp;postal=94043&amp;availabilityMode=0&amp;housing_type=6&amp;parking=2&amp;sale_date=all+dates">CraigsList search</a> for homes in mountain view with attached garages. They seem to go for around $1,200 / bedroom. If you rent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1721-Morgan-St-Mountain-View-CA-94043/19512936_zpid/">this 4br for $4,500</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://perma.cc/7C22-EU5D">perma</a>) rent is $13,500 / year, or around $16,000 in a typical pre-covid market [4].</p>
<p>That seems expensive, but again, not compared to total compensation.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work at Google for 5 years, making $190k the first two, $260k the second two, and $350 the 5th. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#A6tBLiJGb6">Post tax</a>, that’s $793,000 in earnings. In those same 5 years, you spent $80,000 on rent, so you’re down to $713,000 in savings.</p>
<p>As discussed in the corporate perks section, Google takes care of every need you might have, so there are no other costs. [5]</p>
<p>Let’s be really conservative and say you didn’t invest any of your earnings during those 5 years. [6] And let’s continue to be conservative and say you’re using a 5% safe withdrawal rate [7] instead of living off the principal.</p>
<p>With those parameters, you are still pulling in $35,650 in passive income. More than enough to afford the $16,000 for rent, $8,000 for kombucha, granola and massages, and still have over $11,000 left over. [8]</p>
<p>Even one year at Google would net you $126k post-tax, which is $110k after rent. So at 23, you could quit your job and still have 4.5 years of runway to pursue your dreams. And you can do this while continuing to eat superfoods and living in the most expensive rental market in the world.</p>
<p>To summarize: Rising rent costs are nothing compared to corporate tech salaries. Royan’s argument that garages have gotten too expensive for startups is totally unconvincing.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If it’s not perks, pay or cost of living, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>I’ll provide my own theory in the next post, but here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">You donate most of your income</a></li>
<li>You love your job more than anything you can possibly imagine doing instead</li>
<li>You engage in very strong <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference#Temporal_discounting">temporal discounting</a></li>
<li>The credentials, learning or capital from your job are a critical step to future plans</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of those excuses apply, what are you doing instead?</p>
<p>Presumably, you have some values, and those values are not maxed out. They might be hedonic (your life is not as pleasurable as it could be), altruistic (the world is not as good as it could be), or narcissistic (your status is not as high as it could be).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, day jobs seem to be the proximate cause holding you back. I realize that quitting your job won’t magically turn you into a dream-fulfilling machine, but it is probably a good first step.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this. Everyone knows that it is best to directly pursue instrinsic value instead of getting distracted by instrumental goods and side quests.</p>
<p>So again, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I’m not asking rhetorically and this isn’t a motivational essay. I genuinely want to know.</p>
<p>Seriously, email me.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] I’m assuming 20 days of vacation, holiday, sick leave, etc.</p>
<p>[2] If you already work at FAANG, odds are probably much better. This reduces opportunity cost, and strengthens my point.</p>
<p>[3] Of course, the early earnings compound, but your salary also goes up later in life. Maybe that’s not exactly a wash, but this is all back-of-the-napkin anyway.</p>
<p>[4] <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-S-F-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php">https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-S-F-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php</a></p>
<p>[5] I’m sort of kidding, but seriously, what else are you spending money on?</p>
<p>[6] For the record, the S&amp;P is up 70% in the last 5 years, or around 11% annualized.</p>
<p>[7] I know you’ve heard 4%, but 5% seems reasonable. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-inventor-of-the-4-rule-just-changed-it-11603380557">MarketWatch</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jg898y/4_rule_update/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>[8] To be clear, this is not a financial independence blog. It seems great in theory, but given how many people seem to struggle with fulfillment afterwards, I can’t strongly recommend it. I’m not against it either, but I’d like to figure out what’s going before I start giving life advice.</p>
