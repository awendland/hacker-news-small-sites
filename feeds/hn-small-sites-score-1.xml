  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-flute.jpg" alt="Pytest Flute" title="Pytest Flute">

  <p>I occasionally enjoy solving algorithmic problems, for example <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">The Advent of Code</a>.
I’ve been doing them since I was a pimply PHP-slinging teenager, competing with my peers across the UK in the British Informatics Olympiad.
It was terribly nerdy and terribly fun.</p>

<p>Algorithmic problems are often used in technical interviews, which I find less fun.
Strict deadlines stress me out.</p>

<p>In either case, using automated tests makes these problems way easier.
I wish I knew this earlier!</p>

<p>Online algorithmic platforms, such as <a href="https://codility.com/">Codility</a>, provide their own automated tests.
You use these for basic validation on some examples, but edge cases are sneakily reserved for final marking.
To ensure your solution covers all the bases, you need to write your own tests.</p>

<p>In Python, there’s no better test framework than <a href="https://pytest.org/">Pytest</a> - I use it on all my open source projects.
It makes it easy for you to add tests for any Python code.
And it’s much better than Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>unittest</code> is an old horse and cart, while <code>pytest</code> is the batmobile.</p>

<p><img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-pytest.png" alt="Pytest homepage"></p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a small problem together using Pytest.
Here’s the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function <code>solve(items)</code> that takes <code>items</code>, a list of integers, and returns the smallest integer greater than 0 that appears in the list, or 0 if there is none.</p>

  <p>For example <code>solution([1, 2])</code> should return 1, and <code>solution([-1])</code> should return 0.</p>

  <p>The list <code>items</code> will contain up to 1,000,000 integers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let’s write the most basic sketch of a <code>solve</code> function.
Since 0 is a default value to return, if we always return that we can score some easy points.
Create a file called <code>example.py</code> with the contents:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s test the function manually by running it in the Python 3 interpreter. Open the command line and run the examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 14 2019, 21:08:36)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from example import solve
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([1, 2])
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([-1])
0</code></pre></figure>

<p>So we failed on the first example, but succeeded with the second.</p>

<p>Doing this each time we modify the code would get tiresome quickly.
We have to restart the interpreter, rerun the import and tests, and manually compare the outputs.
Writing automated tests now, before we’ve tried to solve the problem properly, makes the whole loop faster.
It also makes us think about all the cases up front.</p>

<p>Let’s write the tests and solve the problem with the <strong>Red, Green, Refactor</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="red">Red</h3>

<p>First, let’s add tests that fail.</p>

<p>Pytest can work with tests in the same file as our code, as simple functions with names starting <code>test_</code>.
We use Python’s <code>assert</code> statement to compare the results of our code with our expectations.</p>

<p>Add tests for the two examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_1</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_2</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then install Pytest and run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python -m pip install pytest

E        +  where 0 = solve([1, 2])

example.py:5: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.03 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the middle of the output, we see the tests in <code>example.py</code> running.
Pytest outputs an <code>F</code> for the failing test, and a dot <code>.</code> for the passing one.</p>

<p>The <code>FAILURES</code> section expands on the failure with the line that failed.
It then shows that <code>solve([1, 2])</code> returned <code>0</code> which doesn’t compare equal to the expected value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The tests we have are a start but they don’t cover all the cases.
We don’t have any lists that contain <code>0</code>.
Also two extremes are missing: the empty list and a list of 1,000,000 items.
Long lists could also contain lots of negative or positive integers, so we should try both of these.</p>

<p>Let’s add more tests.
We can make a list of 1,000,000 items in Python by multiplying a short list.
Add these tests at the end of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_empty_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_list_with_zero</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_long_positive_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>250_000</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_long_negative_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>250_000</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run them again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================

example.py:22: AssertionError
====================== 3 failed, 3 passed in 0.08 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>There are more failures - which is good!</p>

<h3 id="green">Green</h3>

<p>Now we can work to a solution that makes all the tests pass.
Replace <code>solve</code> with this first attempt:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>:</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================
platform darwin -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-4.4.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.9.0

=================================== FAILURES ===================================
________________________________ test_example_2 ________________________________

    def test_example_2():
&gt;       assert solve([-1]) == 0
E       assert -1 == 0
E        +  where -1 = solve([-1])

example.py:14: AssertionError
___________________________ test_long_negative_list ____________________________

    def test_long_negative_list():
&gt;       assert solve([-1, -2, -3, -4] * 250_000) == 0
E       assert -4 == 0
E        +  where -4 = solve(([-1, -2, -3, -4] * 250000))

example.py:30: AssertionError
====================== 2 failed, 4 passed in 0.17 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>We have two different failures now.
It seems we have yet to ignore negative numbers, woops!</p>

<p>Modify the solution to do so, by adding the <code>i &gt; 0</code> condition:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>):</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="collected">def solve(items):
    return min((i for i in items if i &gt; 0), default=0)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-running the tests produces the same, all-passing output as above.
Yay, we got the code down to one line!</p>

As a teen, I often ate my feelings away, when I was bored or just generally snacking in front of the TV very late in the evening and ate way too big portions of food.</p><p>The reason why I started my weight loss journey was that I no longer felt happy for the reflection in the mirror and overall the way I looked. My weight started to have a negative effect on my life and my physique, I was tired of hating myself and my body and wanted to be able to love myself. I remembered I got tagged in a video on Instagram and I was surprised to see myself and I thought to myself " is that really how I look, is that the way people see me" and it made me sad.</p><p>Due to covid-19 I got fired from my job and at that time I thought to myself now is my chance to change the way I see myself and the way I look, so I contacted a personal trainer one of my friends had recommended and I started my Weight Loss Journey.<br></p><h3 id="how-was-it-in-the-beginning-and-what-were-the-biggest-obstacles-you-overcame">How was it in the beginning and what were the biggest obstacles you overcame?</h3><p>The first 2 weeks was the hardest, I had to get used to not eating as much as I used to and focusing on getting the right nutritions protein, and veggies, it's hard to break old habits and make new ones but as soon as I got over the two weeks mark, then for me, it started to feel natural and it was easier to incorporate in my daily life/ routine</p><h3 id="what-were-your-worst-mistakes">What were your worst mistakes?</h3><p>My worst mistake was thinking that I didn't do enough, that I didn't eat healthy enough, and that I didn't exercise enough at the beginning of my weight-loss journey. I pushed myself really hard and didn't get fast enough results in my opinion! because of that mentality and because of those thoughts I almost didn't go through with my weight-loss program, I lost my motivation real quick and quickly found out I had to change my mentality to be able to keep moving forward.</p><p>The biggest milestone for me was when my clothing started to feel loose around my body and when I could see the physical change. A good motivation boost was also when I could do more with the weights at my gym and when I could perform more and I didn't get out of breath within 5-minutes. It is often small things that motivate me the most, for example being able to squat a bit more than last time or being able to run a bit longer.</p><h3 id="what-area-of-life-has-changed-after-becoming-more-healthy">What area of life has changed after becoming more healthy?</h3><p>Because I'm being more active and healthy I feel like I have gotten more opportunities in life. I am no longer bound by my physique and I'm happier for my body, I like where I am and it has an effect on the people surrounding me. They can feel that I have gotten a lot more energy and it makes them happy on my behalf.<br></p><h3 id="what-is-your-weekly-training-protocol-how-many-days-per-week-do-you-train-how-are-your-workouts-structured">What is your weekly training protocol?

		<div>

			
<p>Two very significant developments happened in Crypto this week: Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-files-for-ipo">filed</a> in preparation for an IPO, and the US FinCEN released a new <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf">proposal</a> effectively mandating KYC for unhosted wallets. Together, we believe these developments would have profound implications for the crypto space. </p>



<p>While Coinbase has always had high standards to list coins on its platform, as a public company, such a key revenue-generating activity for the company could see meaningful changes. The “Coinbase pump” could get a totally new meaning in the Crypto space – the extreme scenario could be that the “pure crypto” world – coins and teams that uphold privacy and censorship resistance as the key values that blockchains stand for – could move away from the Coinbase world altogether. The scenario at the other extreme, where most coins do what it takes to move over to the “official” side – also accelerated by Wall Street’s expectations on a newly public Coinbase – forcing the other coins fade into irrelevance – is also possible. </p>



<p>The other significant development is FinCEN’s proposal – that transactions from regulated exchanges to individual wallets not subject to regulation (as well as unregulated foreign exchanges) should be subject to an existing automatic reporting requirement – Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) for cash transactions (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/">Source</a>), </p>



<p>In summary, the proposed rules would</p>



<ol><li>“Require banks and money service businesses (‘MSBs’) to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers” who make crypto transactions into unhosted (read: private) wallets.</li><li>Require that “convertible virtual currency” and “legal tender digital assets” be classified as “monetary instruments” and are therefore subject to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).</li><li>Require that any transaction(s) totaling more than $10,000 in a 24-hour period  be reported to FinCEN, a bureau of the US Treasury Department, and that customer’s identity must be verified; many transactions would require a lower threshold of $3,000. Know-your-customer (KYC) rules, then, apply to even private crypto wallets.</li></ol>



<p><a href="https://decrypt.co/52021/us-treasury-apply-bank-secrecy-act-rules-crypto-wallets">Source</a></p>



<p>These two developments, along with Facebook’s Diem could very well end up defining a “new Crypto” – at least for the US –  a new asset class that is completely regulated, that <em>looks</em> like the “old Crypto” – but does not <em>feel</em> like it. But the new Crypto could be a fun new world  – enabling a new generation that would clearly see digital assets as a category of things to own, along with physical and financial assets, and decentralized in the sense that it is not owned or operated by one party – and censorship resistance and privacy could become concepts that might just need to wait a lot longer. </p>



<p>As we enter this new era in Crypto, it would be helpful to remember this: A list of wallets with names and addresses, with Bitcoin balances that add up to 21 million, is probably not what Satoshi had in mind when he/she/they hit publish on that white paper in 2008. That said, a promising new era beckons the space, and crypto being crypto, it will be exciting!</p>

		<p>12 <strong>African</strong> nations have come together pledging to build a 9 mile wide band of trees that will stretch all the way across Africa, 4750 miles, in order to stop the progressive advancement of the Sahara.</p><!-- START-WP-ADS-ID: 2 --><!-- END-WP-ADS-PRIO -->
<p>Senegal is leading a 12 African nations to build a living defense system appropriately named the Great Green Wall of Africa.</p>
<p>The Sahara is currently the 2nd largest desert in size, only smaller than Antarctica. However, unlike its frozen relative, the Sahara is actually expanding.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimates that, by 2025, 60 % of Africa’s arable land will be covered in Saharan sand, significantly expanding the current 9 million square km’s. Even if these estimations prove aggressive, the effects of farmland exploitation on a region already hard-pressed for food would be devastating on any level.<br>
With this danger in sight, the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have banded together on an remarkable effort to prevent approaching disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg"><img src="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg" alt="Africa" width="300" height="239"></a></p>
<p>Once complete, Africa’s Green Wall will be a manmade forest of drought-resistant trees (principally acacia) extending across the entire region.<br>
9 miles wide and 4,750 miles long, the vision for the project is as committed as it is necessary. Thus far, only 330 miles of greenery stands guard in Northern Senegal, and has cost the Sengalese government over $6 million since the start of digging in 2008. International organizations have pledged over $3 billion to the enormous defense system.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jI_nRHg-0l4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Leaders point out that the Great Green Wall is about more than just defense from windblown sand. The project will bring thousands of jobs to poor communities, and has already transformed usually useless land into gardens scattered with tree nurseries.</p>
<p>The increase of tourists, scientists, and medical professionals has also brought attention and resources to a neglected region in which aid is scarce and doctors are not readily available to needy people.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\

&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\

&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

<h2><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/dvtRS3Zvy3"><img alt="chat on Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/657211973435392011?style=for-the-badge"></a></strong></h2>

<h2 id="🔦-overview">🔦 Overview</h2>

<p>In this challenge, you will act as an insurance company, where you build a pricing model and compete against other players (other insurance companies) for profit. In other words, the player that maximises competitive profit is the winner.</p>

<p>The market in this challenge will be a <code>cheapest-wins market</code>. That means every insurance company offers every customer an annual premium price, and the customer will always pick the company that offers the cheapest price to them (e.g., using&nbsp;a price comparison website).</p>

<p>In order to create your pricing model, you are given historical insurance data: 60K real historical car insurance policies for 4 consecutive years. Each policy concerns 1 vehicle, its drivers and an accident history over 4 years. This data has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample for their entire portfolio.</p>

<p>You are asked to produce a model to price contracts for incoming policies for the 5th year.</p>

<p>The company that makes the most profit in this market, wins the challenge.</p>

<h2 id="💵-cheapest-wins-market">💵 Cheapest-wins market</h2>

<p>As a player or team you represent one insurance company. You will have to provide a premium quote for every policy (or customer) you encounter. So does every other company. But the customer will pick the cheapest price offered to them. This is illustrated bellow:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="323" src="https://d3000t1r8yrm6n.cloudfront.net/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/123/content_Screenshot_from_2020-09-16_18-15-01.png" width="650"></p>

<p>Now that companies 1 and 2 each have a set amount of revenue, they have to pay out the cost of the claims accociated with policies 1-4. So it will look like:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="431" src="https://d3000t1r8yrm6n.cloudfront.net/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/124/content_Screenshot_from_2020-09-16_18-26-11.png" width="650"></p>

<p>So, once the claims are taken into account in the cheapest-wins market, we can see that Company 1 wins as it has the most competitive profit.</p>

<ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="🏇-leaderboards">🏇 Leaderboards</h2>

<p>As an insurance company in this market, you will be responsible for a portfolio of policies that pay you annual premiums. In exchange, you cover their risk. If they make a claim, you will have to pay.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make money, you must:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Estimate&nbsp;the expected loss for your portfolio, so your contracts are profitable</li>
	<li>Come up with a pricing strategy that allows you to compete with others, so that you win contracts</li>
</ol>

<p>To reach these goals we provide you with two leaderboards.</p>

<h3 id="mean-squared-error-mse-leaderboard">Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) leaderboard</h3>

<p>This leaderboard uses your&nbsp;<code>predict_expected_claim</code> function and measures how well you can estimate the risk of policy IDs. It functions by measuring the root mean squared error (RMSE) of your premiums compared to the cost of the claim.</p>

<p>The optimal way to minimise RMSE is done by a model that predicts the expected claim for each contract most accurately.</p>

<p>This allows you to compare the quality of your loss prediction model with your competitors however, there is no explicit reward for performing well on this leaderboard.</p>

<p>This leaderboard is refreshed instantaneously upon submissions, and will always use the same data, disjoint from the other leaderboard.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-profit-leaderboard">Competitive profit leaderboard (Updated every <u>Saturday</u> at 10pm CET)</h3>

<p>This leaderboard uses your <code>predict_premium</code> function. It measures your average competitive profit in a market of size 10 when playing against other players.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each week uses a new set of data to ensure that you don't price the same policy many times, like a real market.</li>
	<li>This measures <code>competitive profit</code>. That means your profit is averaged over many markets that you play in.</li>
	<li>To make sure that results are stable, we keep putting you in markets until your leaderboard rank no longer changes from market to market.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This leaderboard is updated every <u><em><strong>Saturday at 10PM CET</strong></em></u> with your most recent submission</p>

<p><strong>If you do consistently well on this leaderboard, you will likely do well in the final evaluation.</strong></p>

<ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="⚖-evaluation-metric">⚖ Evaluation metric</h2>

<p>The final evaluation metric for this challenge is <code>competitive profit</code>: how much money does your company make in a <em><u>realistic market</u></em>. However we also provide a leaderboard using root mean squared error.</p>

<h3>Root mean squared error (RMSE)</h3>

<p>Given a set of list of claims&nbsp;<span>\(y\)</span> and a set of expected claims <span>\(\hat{y}\)</span> predicted by your model, the RMSE is computed as:</p>

<p><span>\(RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{N}}\)</span></p>

<h3>Competitive profit (<u>the final metric</u>)</h3>

<p>The evaluation process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Compute average profit rank. </strong>First the average competitive profit that your model makes in a market of size 10 (i.e. with 9 other random players) is computed. This gives your model a profit rank.</li>
	<li><strong>Compute realistic <code>competitive profit</code>. </strong>In a <em><u>realistic market</u></em> models that don't perform well don't exist (i.e. go bankrupt). So to compute the realistic <code>competitive profit</code>, we place your model in a market of size 10 with 9 other models picked from the <strong>top 10%</strong> of the the ranking obtained in step 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Two important notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The profit rank in step 1 is not used in the leaderboard. Only the ranking in step 2 is used in the leaderboard.</li>
	<li>Rankings from both steps are generated as a result of many many runs of different random markets. On average you can expect your model to have competed against every other model present at least once.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="🚓nbspmarket-rules">🚓&nbsp;Market rules</h2>

<p>There are two rules that your submissions to the profit leaderboard, and final submissions must follow:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Non-negative training profit. </strong>Your models must be profitable on the training data. That is, the sum of your premiums must not be less than the sum of the claims.</li>
	<li><strong>Participation rule.</strong> Your model must participate (i.e. win at least 1 policy) in <em>5% or more</em> of the markets it is placed in.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="💾-dataset">💾 Dataset</h2>

<p>You can download the dataset from the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game/dataset_files">resources tab</a>.</p>

<p>The dataset contains a total of 100K real historical car insurance policies over 5 years in the recent past.</p>

<p>This has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample from their entire portfolio.</p>

<p>You can find the data dictionary under the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game/dataset_files">resources tab</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of the data concerns third-party liability but there are also other types of car insurance (e.g. theft) present.</p>

<p>For this challenge, the data is split in the following way:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Training data: 60K contracts with 4 years of history (what you are given)</li>
	<li>RMSE leaderboard: 5K contracts with 4 years of history</li>
	<li>9 weekly profit leaderboards: 15K contracts with 4 years of history</li>
	<li>Test data: 100K contracts for the 5th year (what the final competition runs on)</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.</p>
<p>A while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string "VMWare" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information. </p>
<p>Once I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper <a href="http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf">[1]</a> related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.</p>
<p>The end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.</p>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>Now that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info">[2]</a> can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas'</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>renderer</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, extension availability can be queried using the <strong><em>getExtension</em></strong> method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from <a href="https://webglreport.com/">[3]</a> WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="alt-text" src="https://bannedit.github.io/resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png" title="VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com">
<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>width</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>height</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>color_depth</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>colorDepth</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>bitspp</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>pixelDepth</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details on the screen object can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_screen.asp">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Can we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/">[6]</a></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>ram</span> <span>=</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>deviceMemory</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the <a href="https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/">[7]</a> Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues. </p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>We will <strong>not</strong> be covering Fibre, <em>reconciliation</em> or the change detection mechanisms.</p>

<hr>

<p>We should start with a basic bare-bones version of React. To do that we need to touch on some of the core design concepts which React follows, such as:</p>
<h2 id="jsx"><a href="#jsx" aria-label="jsx permalink"></a>JSX</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elements are POJO’s (plain-old-javascript-objects)</li>
<li>Components are functions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pure-rendering"><a href="#pure-rendering" aria-label="pure rendering permalink"></a>Pure rendering</h2>
<ul>
<li>A instance of a render follows: Render = Component(Data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="state-machine"><a href="#state-machine" aria-label="state machine permalink"></a>State machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>One-directional data flow</li>
<li>Data change detection forces updates for all children who need it</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to build our own (super simple) version of React and then add Hooks, to do that we need a basic version of the React engine which should render (log) a component with some props and return the component (for interacting with later).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> React <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> exampleProps <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      unit<span>:</span> <span>"likes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>const</span> compo <span>=</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span>exampleProps<span>)</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render: "</span><span>,</span> compo<span>.</span>inner<span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> compo
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a basic engine we need an accompanying component which returns the React element (object) during the render:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> props<span>.</span>unit<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now use our React and Component together and see its output (below each line of code):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we now have a basic Component which is rendered by our React engine.</p>
<hr>

<p>A brief reminder about Hooks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hooks let you use state and other React features inside a pure component, without writing a class"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Classes would often confuse people and add bloat to your code, however there are other strengths to using Hooks some of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to build and re-use stateful logic</li>
<li>Easier to split components into relatable pieces
-Removes confusion over the many lifecycle methods (i.e. what correlates to what event)</li>
<li>No fundamental changes to your React knowledge, just a more direct way to use features you already know</li>
<li>Easy to add types, as Hooks are just functions (unlike high-order components and most of the render props pattern)</li>
<li>Easy to test with <em>"react-dom/test-utils"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So it is easy to see why Hooks are such a powerful mechanism. So let’s examine how they work and build our own.</p>
<hr>

<p>There are a couple of core concepts with useState:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use state in pure component.</li>
<li>Use any primitive (string/array/object etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the docs they always return:</p>
<ol>
<li>a reducer state</li>
<li>an action dispatcher</li>
</ol>
<p>However this can be simplified into a basic property value and a setter.
There is a simple rule which is very important to Hooks. That is that <strong>the Hooks are called at the top</strong>. That means outside of any conditionals or nesting blocks. This is crucial to the Hooks mechanism and we will examine why.</p>
<p>So let us expand out React engine to include the useState Hook. We will need a "state index" counter, as well as "state store" for values.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> React <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  index<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> 
  state<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>useState</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultProp</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> cachedIndex <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>index
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> defaultProp
    <span>}</span>

    <span>const</span> currentState <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>currentSetter</span> <span>=</span> <span>newValue</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> newValue
    <span>}</span>
    React<span>.</span>index<span>++</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span>currentState<span>,</span> currentSetter<span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> exampleProps <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      unit<span>:</span> <span>"likes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>const</span> compo <span>=</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span>exampleProps<span>)</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render: "</span><span>,</span> compo<span>.</span>inner<span>)</span>
    React<span>.</span>index <span>=</span> <span>0</span> 
    <span>return</span> compo
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have also added a <em>useState</em> method. It works by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking if the current index has a value in the state, if not set the default</li>
<li>Then build the setter for the current state index value</li>
<li>Finally increment the index (for the next Hook) and return the setter and current value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will make use of our <em>useState</em> in our Component.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>name<span>,</span> setName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"Steve"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>count<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>unit<span>}</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
    <span>click</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>personArrived</span><span>:</span> <span>person</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setName</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>See the "count" and "name" usage above. Also we have utilised both inside the "inner" property so that we can spy on it in the terminal. Additionally we have added some manual methods to update the state values. They are manual as we are not worrying about the change detection or reconciliation in this post. We will be manually triggering the returned functions as well as the render method (following how we used it in our React engine section earlier).</p>
<p>So on running the below, we log the rendered output. We can see with each "click() "we are updating the count, and with "personArrived()" we are updating person (terminal output below line of code).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App<span>.</span><span>personArrived</span><span>(</span><span>"Peter"</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<p>There is 1 main issue in our usage. That is that this would NOT work for many components at the same time. It is very tightly coupled to our single component. The state should be held in module scope or a single store namespaced to the component.</p>
<hr>

<p>A short quote from the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A function which runs after the initial render and after every update"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly to <em>useState</em>, the rule about calling at the top-level applies. It is required for our implementation as well.</p>
<p>Couple of concepts for effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created during render</li>
<li>Run in definition order (like <em>useState</em>)</li>
<li>Run after a given lifecycle event (first render and/or when a dependency has changed. i.e. mount and update)</li>
<li>Returns a function (some effects require cleaning e.g. unsubscribing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <em>useEffect</em> Hook mechanism is below:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>callback<span>,</span> dependencies</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> cachedIndex <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>index<span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> hasChanged <span>=</span> dependencies <span>!==</span> React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>dependencies <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>||</span> hasChanged<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> dependencies<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  React<span>.</span>index<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"unsubscribed effect"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A run-through of the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache the store index</li>
<li>Check if the dependency has changed in state (this is our variable tracking mechanism)</li>
<li>If there is no dependency given or its changed, run our effect and update store index value with our dependency value</li>
<li>Then increment the store index for future Hooks to use their own index</li>
<li>Finally return a function</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the way that our effect Hooks also depend on the "state index". Similarly to <em>useState</em>, it relies on the deterministic order of values in the state array.</p>
<p>All state and effect Hooks must be called in the same order, so their state index can always be found in the same location in the state array.</p>
<p>Now lets update our component to use the effect Hook</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>name<span>,</span> setName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"Steve"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> exitThis <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Effect ran"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>count<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>unit<span>}</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
    <span>click</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>personArrived</span><span>:</span> <span>person</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setName</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>unsubscribe</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>exitThis</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above Hook will look for changes on the "name" property, also we have exposed an "unsubscribe" function for our effect Hook.</p>
<p>So now onto the running order during rendering, I have logged the state array with each render to help us follow (see below screenshot for the detailed explanation).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App<span>.</span><span>personArrived</span><span>(</span><span>"Peter"</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 



App<span>.</span><span>unsubscribe</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The below details what is happening above for our effect.</p>
<h2 id="first-render"><a href="#first-render" aria-label="first render permalink"></a>First render</h2>
<p>After 2 state runs the "cachedIndex" is now 2 inside of <em>useEffect</em>. The state value is "undefined" as it does not exist for that index (yet). So we will run our callback and write a new entity into state (under index 2), which is our dependency value (i.e. currently "Steve").</p>
<p>SO: state now has local state values and effect values. It is in a deterministic order based on the “state index” (i.e. where it is called in the component). This means it is reliable as this order should not change. Remember <strong>Rule #1</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="re-renders"><a href="#re-renders" aria-label="re renders permalink"></a>Re-renders</h2>
<p>We will check the 3rd value in our state array and the effect will run only if it changes. See above our Hook runs again when we change the name to "Peter". Lastly we unsubscribe from our Hook.</p>
<p>There are 2 main issues with the above (among others):</p>
<h3 id="1-only-works-with-1-dependency-not-an-array"><a href="#1-only-works-with-1-dependency-not-an-array" aria-label="1 only works with 1 dependency not an array permalink"></a>1. Only works with 1 dependency, not an array.</h3>
<p>It is easy to expand our code so we could use an array. By using the same store index and storing an array of dependencies on the state, not just single value. Then iterate over that dependency array to check for changes.</p>

<p>This is a more complex issue to fix and would require fundamental changes to our React engine. As this is a small POC example it is not worth fixing.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful or at the very least a little interesting. I very much enjoyed learning about Hooks and have a deeper appreciation for them as a feature which has helped move the front-end developer experience forward.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I get a couple emails every week asking how I manage to “do it all” or “balance my schedule”, or how I find the time and motivation to work on so many projects, which makes me think people have a really weird picture of how I spend my 24 hours. My calendar is actually <a href="https://free.linus.zone/">pretty empty</a> most of the time, though I’m pretty protective of my free time. I like having free time because it lets me make sure I read and consume more than I create, which I think is <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/having-ideas/">critical to creativity</a>.</p>
<p>I also leave space on my calendar because I don’t like feeling <strong>busy</strong>. “Busy” is what you are when you’re hopping from meeting to meeting, sprinting through a filled calendar or running up against a deadline. None of that is conducive to following spontaneous creative ideas or working on large interesting projects. When I feel at my productive best, what I feel is <strong>momentum</strong>. I like feeling like I’m on a roll, hopping from one interesting project or idea to the next, not wanting to put down the interest or inspiration. When I feel momentum, everything else – motivation, focus, efficient use of my time – comes naturally. Conversely, when I lose momentum, it takes me a few days of kicking against the ground to get back up to speed.</p>
<p>Having momentum is different than simply working a lot. Busy-ness, what some people think of as “productivity”, comes from <strong>volume</strong> of work. A day spent answering 100 emails and a day spent publishing one great blog post could feel equally productive. Momentum isn’t really about volume of work, but about <strong>rhythm of work</strong>. When I feel creative momentum, it means there’s something interesting or meaningful getting done every day, even if it’s something small. A day spent answering emails is monotonous. It has no rhythm. Even if I only work for two hours in a day, if those two hours produced something meaningful and kept the rhythm of my work going, I feel the momentum continue to the next day.</p>
<p>A busy schedule is like a cacophonous garage band. There’s a lot of volume, but it doesn’t really keep you in the music.</p>
<p>Working with momentum is more like Jazz. There is sound, but mostly in service of forward movement. There’s a groove you can ride, something that keeps you stepping forward. You don’t have to make yourself follow the beats, because it comes naturally. That rhythm and leisure also lets you improvise on top over the music.</p>
<h2 id="building-creative-momentum">Building creative momentum</h2>
<p>How do you find a sense of momentum in your work?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Try to get at least one meaningful or significant thing done every day</strong>, even if that’s the only thing you do. You want to wake up with a clear idea of what that task might be for that day, and go to sleep knowing that you haven’t fallen off your rhythm.</p>
<p>When I have a day not hampered by school schedules or meetings I usually try to publish a blog post, solve a major problem for a side project, or create and share some small unit of work, whether that’s a piece of music or writing or something else. Occasionally, I’ll just spend a day catching up on email and errands, and that’ll be my “project” for the day, but I’m conscious of when I risk going too many days (4-6 days) without “shipping” anything, because that’s how I lose momentum, and it’s hard to regain that lost forward motion.</p>
<p>This might be challenging when working as a solo founder or writer or maker, but especially when you work alone, I think it’s important to draw yourself clear boundaries and say it’s okay to respond late to things if it means you get to protect your creative momentum, because that forward inertia is the heartbeat that keeps you moving forward day after day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leave something unfinished when you stop working</strong>, so when you come back you can pick up right where you left off and get in the same mental state again. When I’m deep in the middle of an interesting project, I’m usually dead focused on that task until I finish. I’ll take pauses to take care of myself, but I usually stay off email and messages, and any spare cycles I have goes towards that task. This means I lose less momentum and “working state” of my mind to context-switching.</p>
<p>Authors sometimes talk about how they begin a writing session by reading the last 1000 words they wrote. When you must switch off of a task, leave some trail you can follow when you return to pick up right where your mind left off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these habits are about working more or working any harder. Instead, they both try to help you stay in the rhythm of work that your mind can ride. They help you build momentum towards a consistent habit of forward motion, which is what really fuels prolific people. These pieces of advice are also about protecting your momentum as a priority. If you value the momentum behind your work, you should prioritize staying in the rhythm, and make few excuses to miss beats. A song that slips every other note falls apart quickly, but if you hit all the right beats, you rarely need strict discipline to stay in time.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to be busy to be prolific.</strong> In fact, having a full calendar gets in the way, because it robs you of the free time and mental space you need to follow interesting ideas and help you replenish your creative taste. To create consistently, don’t work constantly. Instead, find a rhythm on which you can build a momentum that fuels you to keep going right where you left off every time you return to your creative zone. Building on momentum – staying in-rhythm – is the easiest, most enjoyable way to keep creating.</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, like many viruses before it, is bad news for the brain. In a study published Dec.16 in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41593-020-00771-8&amp;t=MmZiNmE2NDZlYzU5MjAwN2NmOWExM2NjODU4Zjk4ZDNiNmJkNTEzYyxQZUREczM0NA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F637885674994974720%2Fcovid19-brain&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608525715"><i>Nature Neuroscience</i></a>, researchers found that the spike protein, often depicted as the red arms of the virus, can cross the blood-brain barrier in mice.</p><p>This strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain.</p><p>The spike protein, often called the S1 protein, dictates which cells the virus can enter. Usually, the virus does the same thing as its binding protein, said lead author William A. Banks, a professor &nbsp;of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a &nbsp;Puget Sound Veterans Affairs Healthcare System physician and researcher. Banks said binding proteins like S1 usually by themselves cause damage as they detach from the virus and cause inflammation.</p><p>“The S1 protein likely causes the brain to release cytokines and inflammatory products,” he said.</p><p>In science circles, the intense inflammation caused by the COVID-19 infection is called a cytokine storm. The immune system, upon seeing the virus and its proteins, overreacts in its attempt to kill the invading virus. The infected person is left with brain fog, fatigue and other cognitive issues.</p><p>Banks and his team saw this reaction with the HIV virus and wanted to see if the same was happening with SARS CoV-2.</p><p>Banks said the S1 protein in SARS-CoV2 and the gp 120 protein in HIV-1 function similarly. They are glycoproteins – proteins that have a lot of sugars on them, hallmarks of proteins that bind to other receptors. Both these proteins function as the arms and hand for their viruses by grabbing onto other receptors. &nbsp;Both cross the blood-brain barrier and S1, like gp120, is likely toxic to brain tissues.</p><p> “It was like déjà vu,” said Banks, who has done extensive work on HIV-1, gp120, and the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>The Banks’ lab studies the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer’s, obesity, diabetes, and HIV. But they put their work on hold and all 15 people in the lab started their experiments on the S1 protein in April. They enlisted long-time collaborator Jacob Raber, a professor in the departments of Behavioral Neuroscience, Neurology, and Radiation Medicine, and his teams at Oregon Health &amp; Science University.</p><p>The study could explain many of the complications from COVID-19.</p><p>“We know that when you have the COVID infection you have trouble breathing and that’s because there’s infection in your lung, but an additional explanation is that the virus enters the respiratory centers of the brain and causes problems there as well,” said Banks.</p><p>Raber said in their experiments transport of S1 was faster in the olfactory bulb and kidney of males than females. This observation might relate to the increased susceptibility of men to more severe COVID-19 outcomes.</p><p>As for people taking the virus lightly, Banks has a message:</p><p>“You do not want to mess with this virus,” he said. “Many of the effects that the COVID virus has could be accentuated or perpetuated or even caused by virus getting in the brain and those effects could last for a very long time.”</p><p>This study was partially supported by a National Institute on Aging-funded COVID-19 supplement to a shared RF1 grant of Banks and Raber.​</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;The S1 protein likely causes the brain to release inflammatory products causing a storm in the brain, researchers said.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">II</a>, IV) look at the Dothraki from George R.R. Martin’s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>.  We’re looking at, in particular, the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up in the face of research.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">Last week</a>, we looked at the subsistence systems of historical Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans and found that the Dothraki subsistence system was less than a pale imitation of them, having stripped out nearly every activity from the daily routine of survival which wasn’t brutal or violent.</p>



<p>This week, we’re going to keep looking at the elements of culture beyond simple subsistence (with the caveat, noted last time, that subsistence systems often dictate over elements of culture).  Necessarily, this is going to make this post a bit more of an <em>omnium gatherum</em> catch-all, with a bunch of discrete topics.  In each case, it is going to make more sense to introduce the Dothraki practice and then contrast it the practices of the Great Plains and the Eurasian Steppe.</p>



<p>I want to note up front, <strong>we’re going to be talking here about slavery, sex, sexual violence, and regular violence</strong>, both as they occur in <em>ASoIaF</em>/<em>GoT</em> and how they occurred in the real world.  I try to keep this blog mostly G-rated, but history itself wasn’t always G-rated and <em>ASoIaF</em> certainly isn’t; reader discretion is advised.  In the interest of keeping clear which section is which, I have dropped my <em>hilarious</em> ‘An X of Ys’ joke section-title format and instead tried to give very descriptive section titles so you can decide if there is one or two you just want to skip.</p>



<p>Also, I want to note before we start that this post is going to be a bit more book-heavy than show-heavy, just because it is generally easier to pin down things which are explicitly said in the book rather than things implied by the visual language of the show.  <strong>That said, I think the show, if anything, magnifies the characterization the book presents on each of today’s topics</strong>, either dialing them up to 11 or (in the cases where the books have oddly excluded things) making that exclusion more intentional and explicit given the different nature of film (since in a book, if an object is not described in a scene, we may assume it is still there and just undescribed; in a visual medium, if it is not seen, it is not there).</p>



<p>And as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>Finally, as a reminder that we are not merely unfairly picking on some fantasy author who just wanted to create fictional societies without any tether to, or comment on, real societies which existed in the past or exist today, <strong>the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>A statement which claims, quite directly, that the Dothraki are modeled primarily off of both Eurasian Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans (with a ‘dash’ of fantasy).</p>



<h2>A Collection of Cultures</h2>



<p>(Ok, I had <em>one</em> more too-cute-by-half section title left)</p>



<p>The first thing to touch on here is not a cultural element but rather a fact about Dothraki culture, which is simply that:<strong> there is <em><span>a</span></em> ‘Dothraki culture.’  </strong>The Dothraki have a single language, a single holy city (Vaes Dothrak), a single system of social organization (Khals, etc), apparently a single set of dietary customs, a single religion with a well-understood prophecy of a future leader, and so on.  <strong>In short, there is a <em>single</em> Dothraki culture</strong> which is shared by all of the various <em>khalasars</em> of the Dothraki Sea.  Crucially this is not merely an observation made by characters <em>outside</em> of the Dothraki culture (that would be understandable – significant cultural divides are often invisible to outsiders who cannot mark the significance of ‘small’ differences), but is also a fact observed by the Dothraki themselves, explicit in things like the collective housing of all windowed <em>khaleesi</em> and even in the language the Dothraki use to talk about each other, especially in contrast to the Lhazareen and other non-Dothraki.  <strong>This is a single culture without any real ethnic divisions and is regarded as such by its members</strong>, not just outsiders.</p>



<p>And that is <em>nonsense</em>.</p>



<p>Even if we only take the Eastern <em>third </em>of the Eurasian Steppe (the Eurasian steppe actually divides quite neatly in thirds, broken up by the Ural mountains (dividing the western and central steppe), and the Fergana Valley (dividing the central and eastern steppe)), we have not <em>just</em> the Mongols, but Tatars, Keraites, Naimans, Merkits, Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Khitans, and (sort of) Jurchen.  <strong>Those are meaningful differences!</strong>  There are, for instance, two entire distinct language <em>families</em> on the Steppe (I should note that there is some dispute here about the lines between language families, but my impression is that the consensus now is that the Mongolic and Turkic languages are not directly related as they were once believed to be), each containing a number of often non-mutually intelligible languages within them (the Turkic language family has some 35 documented languages).  <strong>These groups were often not only linguistically distinct, but culturally and religiously distinct.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Great Plains were no less varied!</strong>  Isenberg’s chart (<em>op. cit.</em>, 59) – mentioned last week and based on US Government data – lists Assiniboine, Atsina, Comanche, Blackfeet, Koiwa (and Kiowa-Apache), Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho as the nomadic peoples of the Great Plains (it also lists 11 more sedentary Native peoples).  And that understates the variety because – remember – this is a survey from the <em>outside</em> which is going to miss significant variety (like not breaking out the Lakota from the Dakota, etc.)!</p>



<p>This brings us to two crucial points.  <strong>The <em>first</em> problem is that the lack of cultural and lingustic variety is itself an error on Martin’s part</strong>.  This isn’t quite a unique problem for the Dothraki – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">as I’ve noted, particularly with The North, many of the regions of Westeros are a lot less varied than they ought to be given their size</a> – but it is more pronounced here.  <strong>The Dothraki Sea is about as large on the map as <em>all six</em> of the Southern parts of the Seven Kingdoms, but has nowhere near the cultural diversity</strong> despite lacking a unifying government or hegemonic religion (as a rule, large nation-states are the <em>product</em> of state-building, not a prerequisite.  To put it bluntly, France is full of French people because the government in Paris saw fit to make it that way.  There is no such homogenizing institution in the Dothraki Sea).  Again, I don’t expect Martin to bring the story to a screeching halt to discuss this, but think about how much the feeling of a real culture could have been enhanced even a little by having Khal Drogo’s army involve multiple ethnicities of Dothraki nomads, or to have him refer to equivalents of the Merkits or Tartars (we may call these non-existent cultures the Nopethraki) occupying other parts of the Dothraki Sea and possibly trading at Vaes Dothrak.  Something just as simple as meeting other nomads either at the wedding or in Vaes Dothrak who spoke a different language (or given the size of Khal Drogo’s <em>khalasaar</em>, have him brag – as many historical rulers were want to do – about all of the many different Nopethraki peoples who also followed him).</p>



<p><strong>The second problem this creates is for this post</strong>.  While we have one fictional culture to compare, we have to compare it with <em>dozens</em> of real historical peoples – an obviously impossible task in this format (or probably any format).  For the sake of keeping this manageable, I am going to reduce my points of comparison specifically to the Mongols (c. 1150-1250) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_Nation">Sioux </a>(also known as the ‘Seven Council Fires’ though note that this is <em>also</em> a diverse grouping, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language">Lakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_language">Western and Eastern Dakota</a>).  Fortunately for me, these two sets are peoples <em>specifically</em> cited by Martin as inspirations for the Dothraki.  Where relevant, I will jump to other groups, but we’ll mostly focus on these two.  <strong>We are going to move topically to see how much the Dothraki are rooted in anything we can identify from these real historical cultures that supposedly inspired them.</strong></p>



<h2>Music and Art</h2>



<p><strong>Try as I might, I could not find any clear reference to Dothraki artwork. </strong> Vests are described repeatedly as painted (AGoT, 83, 193), but apart from the exceptional one made for Viserys (AGoT, 329), how they are painted doesn’t seem to ever be mentioned.  One might fairly call Dothraki hair braiding and belling an art (AGoT, 30), but while the number of braids matters, it doesn’t seem like the quality or artistry is ever commented on.  The statues that line the way to Vaes Dothrak are all captured, the “ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki have sacked” (AGoT, 324) and Vaes Dothrak itself lacks its own building style, instead being a mix of styles of peoples the Dothraki have enslaved (AGoT, 326-7).  Drogo’s palace has just “rough-hewn timbered walls” and Daenerys smiles to herself at the contrast between the expected grandeur and the actual building (AGoT, 327), apparently devoid of decoration.  It’s possible that the bride-gift weapons (<em>AGoT</em>, 86) were decorated – the materials in question were clearly lavish – but we are not told.  Later, Daario Naharis has a decorated <em>arakh</em> (in the shape of a naked woman, because <em>of course</em>, <em>ASoS</em>, 482), but he is …</p></div></div>

You might asks why I don’t suggest av1 for Emacs Conf. I’m actively
experimenting with that, and using <b>-cpu-used 1</b> with all tricks can
almost halve the bitrate compared to the vp9 call below and still get
better quality, but at the cost of taking 3 days to encode a mere 3
minutes. That’s on a not too low-specced system (almost 10 CPU-days at
4 Ghz). To re-compress the whole conference, this is currently far too
expensive. Values for cpu-used above one actually give worse results
than the vp9 call. With av1 I see speeds below 0.0008x — every second
takes 20 minutes to encode, one minute takes roughly one day to
encode.
</p>

<p>
That said, this is an ffmpeg-call with optimized AV1-parameters for
minimum filesize (no guarantees for perfection: most of these
parameters are experimental — following the descriptions in the docs —
and I could not yet test the changes due to each parameter):

This requires around 40h of encoding time for the 2.5 minutes of

The quality 60 version is down to 1MiB per minute — 128kbit/s for HD
video, and if you don’t know where to look there is almost no visible
breakage. If you don’t see how awesome that is, you did not grow up
with a computer in the filesharing age <code>:-)</code>
</p>

<p>
The quality 63 version even gets down to 87.5kbits/s. Watch the video
to judge the quality yourself.
</p>

<p>
With these codecs we could do swarming HD-video streaming on an
ancient double-ISDN line. A private DSL connection with 40Mbit/s
upstream would suffice to stream pre-converted low-movement HD-video
to 400 fans. This is the silent revolution of media compression
algorithms whose potential has mostly gone un-noticed by the public.
</p>

<p>
At 40MiB per hour, all the recordings from the main track of a three
day conference would fit on a simple DVD or an old 4GB USB stick (the
cheapest you get). A plain CD could hold 20 hours of standup comedy,
and the typical 32GB USB stick would hold 800 hours of low-movement
video — that’s more than a full month non-stop video.
</p>

<p>
From a few tests I did, high-movement video is about 5x as big, but
that still leaves us with almost one week of video on a plain 32GiB
USB stick — which is cheaper to buy than a typical monthly streaming
subscription.
</p>

<p>
Despite being purely digital, the encoding time vs. bandwidth clearly
makes this an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale">economy of scale</a>. Do you still wonder why streaming
platforms are currently shooting up like mushrooms? However this would
also scale perfectly with decentralization: One gaming-PC would
suffice to encode the creative output of a professional youtuber with
high production-quality like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/greymatter">CGP Grey</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/maiLab">maiLab</a> (10-30 minutes per
week). Looking only at electricity, that’s around 50€ per month.
Investing that would allow to self-compress the video enough that it
could be sent by email, avoiding the need for centralized
infrastructure.

		<p>Like in everything else, the more information you have about what to expect during the various stages of your company’s evolution, the higher your chances for success. Deciding to pursue and navigate through a potential acquisition or funding is a huge time commitment and isn’t recommended if you’re on the fence.</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself, ‘How do I tell if I’m on the fence?’ ‘What kind of time commitment are we really talking about here?’</p>
<p>If you can get through this blog post, that is at least a good sign.</p>

<h3>First things first</h3>
<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself and your C-team before getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we go through the [acquisition, funding] process and don’t accept any offers, how will that affect our commitment to continuing to grow the business?</li>
<li>How long do we want to commit to this after the acquisition?</li>
<li>How much control do I want after we sell?</li>
<li>Will I be able to work under someone else?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you should have a good baseline on whether or not to proceed.</p>
<h3>A quick story</h3>
<p>A few years back, one of our founders came to us stating he was ready to go out and raise the next round of funding. Knowing their product was at a 25% net growth rate with a high churn rate, it was obvious that the sales velocity wasn’t there. The product took too long to consume and implement – let alone explain. Raising more funds would only propel them into the precarious and frustrating position of slinging a product that was far from product market fit while burning potential strategic customers. Simply put, they weren’t ready to scale.</p>
<p>We asked the C-team to go back to the drawing board and reanalyze the customer data in order to find their true viable market. They came back to us with their newly identified blue ocean strategy.</p>
<p>Did we prompt them to go out and raise funding then? No. Over the next 18 months, we made small investments in the company and worked alongside them as they proved out the new strategy. And it worked. They were finally sailing in a big ocean instead of a small pond. The big market participants recognized and validated the product and the technology, we reduced churn and gained further traction. Then, before we even got the chance to raise more funds, we received a potential opportunity to exit. The point is the numbers say everything and will tell your story.</p>

<h3>So you determined it’s a go….</h3>
<h4><b>What you’ll need:</b><span> A secure data room is advisable (i.e. <a href="https://try.docsend.com/access-venture-partners">DocSend</a>), legal counsel, financial/tax advisors &amp; patience.</span></h4>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4><span>If you’re fundraising:</span></h4>
<h4>Timeline: 80-120 days, <a href="https://medium.com/entrepreneurship-in-world-3-0/realistic-startup-fundraising-timeline-b76b0359b933" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is a day-by-day breakdown of the process</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to begin the process at least 6 months before. Identify ideal investors by researching who has <em>recently</em> invested in the space and their target stage.</li>
<li>Use Crunchbase to identify potential investors. Signal is nice but not the most comprehensive set of data and the filtering schematic is janky / you’ll have to dig past the popular kids.</li>
<li>Don’t reach out to investors that haven’t had any investment activity in more than 2 years.</li>
<li>Start mapping introduction routes, and if possible, start communicating ahead of time.</li>

<p><strong><em>Ian Harris explains that more than half of commonly performed surgical operations may be placebos. Adequate studies using a blinded control group are essential.</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/surgery-surgeon-ongoing-operate.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><br>Ian Harris, a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, wrote a book titled&nbsp;Surgery, The Ultimate Placebo. I haven’t read the book, but I watched his excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzueFu1cq5U">YouTube video lecture</a>&nbsp;on the subject. It is an eye-opening evaluation of commonly performed surgical operations that have been tested and shown to be no more effective (and arguably worse) than placebo, or that have never even been tested. He covers the history of sham surgery studies, talks about placebo effects, and explains why so many surgeons ignore the evidence and continue to do ineffective operations. In the process, he provides a valuable education in critical thinking.</p>



<p>His introduction to skepticism at age 18 was a documentary on television where dowsers were subjected to an elegant controlled test by James Randi and Dick Smith. They buried ten pipes and challenged dowsers to determine which pipe the water was flowing through. When they knew which pipe was active, the dowsers all identified it correctly; but when they didn’t know, they were only right 12% of the time. He was impressed by how a simple test could easily refute a claim.</p>



<p>When he watched the same documentary again recently, he was impressed by the reaction of dowsers when shown that dowsing didn’t work. He recognized it as the same reaction he was seeing in surgeons when their operations were tested and shown not to work. They made up excuses, hypotheses about why the experiment might not have given the results they expected, and said they wouldn’t give up doing the operation, “because it works”.</p>



<p>In the early 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, a common operation for heart disease was internal mammary artery ligation. It seemed obvious that it worked: patients felt better. In 1939, a sham surgery experiment showed that an equal number of patients got better if the surgeon just made an incision but didn’t ligate the arteries. Surgeons heeded the evidence and stopped doing that operation.</p>



<p>He takes us on a historical tour of surgical operations that have been tested and shown not to work. Surgeons often reject the evidence and make up rationalizations as to why it might not have worked in those studies, but they remain convinced that it does work&nbsp;<em>in their hands</em>. When they refuse to stop doing that operation, their excuses sound just like those of the dowsers. They insist on continuing to do the operation “because it works” (in their experience). Billions of dollars are being wasted on hundreds of thousands of operations that have been shown not to work or that have never even been tested to see if they work better than doing nothing.</p>



<h2>False analogies and faulty reasoning</h2>



<p>Theory often says an operation&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;work, but&nbsp;<strong>biological plausibility means absolutely nothing</strong>&nbsp;unless tests can show that it&nbsp;<em>really does work</em>. Dr. Harris says “You can make up a biologically plausible mechanism for&nbsp;<em>anything you want</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>The parachute analogy</strong>&nbsp;says you don’t need a randomized controlled study of parachutes to find out if they work. Dr. Harris says he has seen it frequently invoked, usually for procedures that are later shown to be rubbish.</p>



<p><strong>Comparative effectiveness studies</strong>&nbsp;are done comparing two different methods of something like steroid injections for back pain, but they don’t tell us whether either of them work. They would be better called comparative ineffectiveness studies. The first step should have been to use a control group and compare steroid injections to no injections.</p>



<h2>Perceived effectiveness</h2>



<p>Perceived effectiveness is a combination of two things: the treatment’s specific effects plus its placebo effects.</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;<strong>shortcuts in thinking</strong>&nbsp;that all humans are hard-wired to take. They assume correlation means causation, and they fall for the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Post_hoc,_ergo_propter_hoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a></em>&nbsp;fallacy (assuming that if B follows A that must mean that A caused B). These shortcuts in thinking often lead to errors. Improvement might be due to something other than the surgery, like the natural history of the disease, regression to the mean, or concomitant treatments.</p>



<p>Improvement can be perceived by the patient (sometimes it is a false perception due to placebo factors or misinterpretations) and/or by the doctor, due to factors like measurement error, reporting bias, confirmation bias, etc. Doctors rate the effectiveness of their treatments higher than their patients do. The perception of the doctors is&nbsp;<em>wrong</em>; they consistently overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of their treatments.</p>



<h2>Treatment is not always needed</h2>



<p>He tells the story of Archie Cochrane, for whom the Cochrane Collaboration of systematic analyses was named. As the only doctor in a POW camp in World War II, he was responsible for 10,000 prisoners, many suffering from open wounds, dysentery, typhoid, and other serious diseases. His requests for doctors and medicines were denied by his German captors, who said doctors were superfluous. In six months, only 4 prisoners died, each of them shot while trying to escape. The rest all got better, without treatment.</p>



<p>Harris’ story&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1444794/?page=1">distorts the truth</a>, but it serves as a vivid illustration of an important fact: recovery often occurs without any treatment. Cochrane’s experience led him to question much of what was being done in the name of medicine. Patients were kept in bed for a week after a heart attack not because of any evidence, but just “because it makes sense”. Cochrane did a controlled study and found that bedrest was actually harming people.</p>



<h2><em>Surgery often acts as a placebo</em></h2>



<p>Harris covers the many factors that affect a patient’s response to a placebo. A systematic review found that placebo was just as effective as surgery in over half of the cases studied, and&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the recent trials comparing surgery to placebo have found that surgery was no better than placebo.</p>



<p>He demolishes all the arguments surgeons give for continuing to do these operations that have been tested and shown not to work. The real reason is that they continue to&nbsp;<em>believe the procedure is effective</em>, just as the dowsers continued to believe they could find water with a forked stick. Tradition and personal experience triumph over science and reason.</p>



<p>Science is just a systematic way to reduce error. Imperfect, but better than any other way. Blinded trials are the least biased way to determine effectiveness.</p>



<h2>Ethical concerns</h2>



<p>Some people object that doing sham surgeries is unethical. Placebos are unethical in clinical practice for treating an individual, but not in research where they are essential to finding the truth and balancing harms and benefits for large groups of people and for preventing future harms. Surely, it’s unethical to perform ineffective surgeries. On Science-Based Medicine, we are constantly questioning the ethics of selling dietary supplements with claims that have never been properly tested. Some herbal medicines might be harmless, but surgery always carries a risk of infection, tissue damage, and adverse effects. And it is expensive: millions of dollars are being wasted worldwide on procedures that expose patients to risk for no possible benefit.</p>



<h2>Conclusion: Evidence is essential</h2>



<p>He concludes by saying we should treat new surgical procedures like new drugs, and only pay for those that are part of a trial to find out if they work. Most surgical procedures being done today have not been subjected to blinded trials.</p>



<p>Advice to patients: it’s OK to ask for a second opinion, and you should always ask your surgeon for the evidence showing the benefits and risks of the procedure, and what you can expect to happen if surgery is not done.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GraphQL has been seeing a rapid uptick in adoption.  It enables a more expressive interface between frontend and backend code by allowing developers to specify exactly what data is required to render a given page.  While there are numerous wins for frontend engineers, the backend team needs a different mindset.  Instead of writing route handlers that return a fixed set of data (or maybe a few variations), the backend team must write <strong>resolver functions</strong> which return portions of the dataset individually. </p>
<p>We've seen that many developers will apply route-level checks as a starting point for authorization in their applications.  A common pattern is using decorators or other route level guards that ensure a user meets certain requirements (the user is an admin, the user has a certain role, etc.) before the route code is run.</p>
<p>This approach is easy to get started with, but is typically not feasible in GraphQL.  There is one route in a GraphQL application, and the potential set of data returned is highly variable.  There are many more combinations of fields in a GraphQL query than the number of routes in a typical REST application.</p>
<p>Since GraphQL is oriented around access to individual data elements, a natural place to enforce authorization is during data access.  GraphQL's official documentation acknowledges as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where should you perform validation and authorization checks? The answer: inside a dedicated business logic layer. Your business logic layer should act as the single source of truth for enforcing <em>business domain rules</em> [emphasis added].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer">https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer</a></p>
<p>Great. Easy.  But how does that actually work?  How do we enforce a business domain rule? Is there a simple abstraction for specifying them?</p>
<p>In this post, we'll look at using oso—an open source authorization library—for enforcing authorization rules.  We'll see how to declaratively specify authorization rules in Polar, oso's policy language, and how to integrate oso into a GraphQL application in only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We'll use SQLAlchemy as our ORM, and Graphene — a popular Python GraphQL library.  The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/sqlalchemy.html#installation">library</a> will provide the glue between oso, GraphQL and SQLAlchemy, allowing us to enforce authorization consistency.</p>

<p>We'll start with a basic Flask app representing an expense management application.  To follow along, <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app">clone the project on GitHub</a>.  We'll walk through the parts of this app relevant to authorization, but the full code is available in the project. We'll assume some familiarity with Flask, SQLAlchemy and GraphQL.  Each section of this post is based on a commit in the repository, and we'll link to the relevant commit at the beginning of the section.</p>
<p>If you plan on following along and trying out the examples as you read, make sure to follow the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/blob/main/README.md">README</a> to install the dependencies so you can run the code. This section covers the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/tree/922af81fc265efc82f9572e174833689f051ae9a">initial commit</a>.</p>
<p>Our app has a few models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> An expense created by a user.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> A user accessing the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start with these, and add some more later.  Here are our initial models from <code>models.py</code>. These are regular SQLAlchemy models.  We used the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/">flask_sqlalchemy</a> library to integrate with Flask and make our setup a bit easier.</p>
<pre><code>from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Expense(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'expenses'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    amount = db.Column(db.Integer)

    created_by_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))
    created_by = relationship("User")

    description = db.Column(db.Text)

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(256))
</code></pre>

<p>An Expense is created by a user, available at the <code>Expense.created_by</code> property.</p>
<p>We also have a GraphQL schema defined using Graphene over these models in <code>app/schema.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import graphene
from graphene import relay
from graphene_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyConnectionField, SQLAlchemyObjectType

from flask import g

from . import models

class Expense(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Expense
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class User(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.User
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    expenses = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(Expense.connection)
    user = graphene.Field(User)
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()

    def resolve_user(parent, info):
        return (g.current_user
                if isinstance(g.current_user, models.User)
                else None)

# ... snip ...

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
</code></pre>

<p>This schema uses the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/">Graphene-SQLAlchemy library</a> to create Graphene schema objects for our SQLAlchemy models.  This is a <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/#defining-our-models">standard approach</a> for using SQLAlchemy with Graphene.</p>
<p>We can make a simple query (I'm using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> tool for this, but you can also just go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/graphql">http://localhost:5000/graphql</a> in your browser) and see that our app is working:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Adding authorization</h2>
<p>At this point, we have a basic GraphQL app, without authorization.  Let's set that up. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/commit/8bf8c4a411f83e640fdd3537ddcc3d59049edecf">commit on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Our initial authorization rule will be based on the concept of data owners: <em>users can view their own expenses.</em></p>
<p>To implement this rule, we would need to perform filtering at the SQLAlchemy level. Which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a custom resolver for Expense</li>
<li>Checking all other places the GraphQL schema might access expenses</li>
<li>Implementing the custom SQLAlchemy query</li>
<li>Repeating for every other model and authorization check.</li>
</ol>
<p>This authorization rule is based on each database record—sometimes referred to as object-level permissions.  It can be challenging to abstract as middleware, and is certainly more complex than just adding the simple decorator we discussed earlier. </p>
<p>Instead, we'll use the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library.  We need to make two changes to set this up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an instance of <code>Oso</code> to our application.</li>
<li>Write a policy containing our authorization rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add oso, we'll modify the <code>create_app</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models

def create_app():
    # snip ...

    # Create oso instance which will hold our policy.
    oso = Oso()  
    # Make SQLAlchemy models available in the policy.
    register_models(oso, db.Model)  
    # Load policy file into oso.
    oso.load_file(Path(__file__).parent / "policy.polar")   

    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we swap out the <code>SQLAlchemy</code> object in our app with <code>AuthorizedSQLAlchemy</code>. In <code>models.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from sqlalchemy_oso.flask import AuthorizedSQLAlchemy

db = AuthorizedSQLAlchemy(
    get_oso=lambda: current_app.oso,
    get_user=lambda: getattr(g, "current_user", None),
    get_action=lambda: "read"
)
</code></pre>

<p>We use this object instead of <code>flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy</code>.  It provides a <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session.html">SQLAlchemy Session object</a> that filters queries to only return objects that are authorized for the current user and action.</p>
<p>Our policy file, <code>app/policy.polar</code> is empty for now.</p>
<p>Now, let's check our query results:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png"></p>
<p>Nothing's returned anymore.  Why? The policy file is empty.  Polar is deny by default, so we'll need to add some rules.  Before we do that, let's take a look at how this is working.  Our app has an endpoint that will log the SQL used to execute our last query.  If you're following along, run the app with:</p>
<pre><code>$ FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES=app/policy.polar FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code></pre>

<p>Run a query in GraphiQL.  Below is a good starting point.</p>
<pre><code>{
  expenses {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        description
        createdBy {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now visit, <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we see:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT count(*) AS count_1
  FROM (
        SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
               expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
               expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
               expenses.description AS expenses_description
          FROM expenses
         WHERE 0 = 1
         ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
       ) AS anon_1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice our WHERE clause: <code>0 = 1</code>.  Where's that coming from? <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> enforces our Polar policy by translating rules from the policy into SQL filters.  <code>0 = 1</code> is always false, which causes no records to be returned from the database.</p>
<h2>Adding some rules</h2>
<p>Now that we have oso integrated, let's finish implementing our authorization rule.  Keep the app running, the <code>FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES</code> environment variable we set will ensure that Flask reloads the app when you change the policy.</p>
<p>Let's try the following (in <code>app/policy.polar</code>):</p>
<pre><code>allow(_actor, _action, _resource);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy allows the user to access any object.  In Polar, each statement in the policy is called a rule.  The <code>allow</code> rule is a special rule that is used as the entrypoint to policies.  It has three arguments, the <strong>actor</strong> (who's making the request), the <strong>action</strong> (what the request will do), and the <strong>resource</strong> (what the request is operating over).  Our policy has one rule.  Each parameter starts with <code>_</code> which indicates an anonymous variable (one that matches anything because there are no constraints on it).</p>
<p>Rerun the query, and check out the SQL (Just refresh <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>. You'll see a few statements there, I've picked out the primary SQL query used to resolve the GraphQL query):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
       expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
       expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
       expenses.description AS expenses_description
  FROM expenses
 WHERE 1 = 1
 ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
 LIMIT 4
OFFSET 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we see <code>WHERE 1 = 1</code>.  This is always true! As a result, everything's been returned.  </p>
<p>Let's go a little further:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "read", _: Expense);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy is saying all users can read all expenses. Again, the <code>_</code> denotes an anonymous or ignored variable, but the <code>: User</code> syntax is checking that the input data matches a specific type. In this case, the User and Expense models from our <a href="http://models.py/">models.py</a> file.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-bought-new-computer">Why I bought new computer<small><a href="#why-i-bought-new-computer" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<p>My computer's display started slowly dying this year, suffering from gradually more and more serious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbR2VhHLuW0">ghosting</a>. By November it was so bad that I could barely read any letters after an hour or two of using the machine. It's MacBook 12" early 2015, which I bought a few years ago, second hand, refurbished.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>refurbished</em> should mean that the computer was used as a sample machine somewhere, e.g. in an Apple Store. When they didn't need it anymore, it got checked for defects and sold for a cheaper price as a second hand product in a very good shape. My theory is that the computer was almost unused by the time I've bought it, but perhaps it was open with the display shining all the time in the shop, so durability of the pixels suffered a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to that, the machine's performance is a total potato these days. I have always appreciated its portability (size and weight of a magazine) and silence (has no fan), but I've spent most of this year at home, so I didn't care about portability, and the world got more bloated, so the minimum requirements for a smooth user experience are higher than in 2015. So by the summer 2020 I found myself wishing a new machine, and it just happened that Apple was about to release something with the new processors. I decided to wait, because I thought that (at the time) the latest machines would get cheaper if Apple releases something new.</p>

<p>When the first reviews were out, I waited for some more, but then it was just obvious this is a big change, a revolutionary machine, which is going to destroy the consumer market. I've enjoyed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">Apple Silicon M1: Black. Magic. Fuckery.</a> - compilation of various first impressions</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away</a> - general review</li>
<li><a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2">Why Is Apple’s M1 Chip So Fast?</a> - how they made it and why competition won't be able to compete</li>

</ul>
<p>After that, I decided I'll buy the new Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air, because it doesn't make sense to go for anything older if I plan to have the new computer for as many years as possible going forward. It's not <em>cheap</em> cheap, but it's still huge performance for a reasonable price. Honestly, I'm surprised I happen to be buying a freshly released Mac announced just a few weeks ago, when so far I've been buying only second-hand Apple hardware, but it just felt like it makes sense to do this, all things considered.</p>
<p>I decided I don't need more RAM than 8 GB, because nobody from the first reviewers managed to give the RAM a hard time. It seemed to me it's a different beast altogether and it doesn't make sense to just compare numbers and say that more is better. Apple allows you to buy a computer with more than 8 GB RAM, but I think it's just a trap how to satisfy and charge those who don't believe the reviews and just want more RAM whatever it takes.</p>
<p>I also decided I want 512 GB drive, as I'm used to that size and I didn't want to downgrade. Also, I had serious capacity problems with my 16 GB iPhone SE and my wife still has serious capacity problems with her 128 GB old Air, so I really wanted to avoid that in the future.</p>
<p>I decided I don't mind that Docker or any kind of virtualization isn't supported (yet), because I don't use it. I'm self-employed solo enterpreneur now and Docker or Kubernetes play no role in my dev stack, also I use no virtual machines, nothing like that. If I was about to get a regular job somewhere, I assume they'd provide me a dedicated work computer. Also, I think <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/download-and-try-the-tech-preview-of-docker-desktop-for-m1/">it's gonna be resolved soon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions<small><a href="#first-impressions" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<p>The new Air arrived this Tuesday, so as of writing this article, I work on it for 4 days. To be honest, upgrading from a years old machine with a dying display and a potato performance, to this shiny new beast, is… It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>The change in responsivity is really significant and I totally love it. I don't think I've ever used anything faster. With my potato machine I got used to going to bloated websites from my phone, as it felt that iPhone X can deal with them much better, but now the phone feels slow. <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">The optimized apps</a> are super snappy. Safari runs smooth and fast like crazy. Firefox the same. Spotify, Slack, Discord, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, all the annoying bloated websites, which I used to hate so much for the past months, now run like if they were the most optimized websites on the internet. Honestly, I have problems to grasp the speed by my brain. It's just too much of a difference compared to my previous experience. It's like riding on a sloth and then suddenly switching to a super sonic rocket. I feel like I click on a tab in my browser and it happens instantly, and then it takes billion milliseconds until my brain realizes the action has been already performed and I can proceed to whatever else I wanted to do. I can now actually say when something needs network, because everything else is super fast. Whenever there's the slightiest lag, it's because network is involved, and because my network is slow.</p>
<p>I wanted to go with clean installation, so I didn't do any kind of smart restore from backup or anything like that. Just setting up the new system and moving my files, installing a few programs, like in the old days. Thanks to fast USBs and SSDs on both the computers and my external drive, moving the data was very fast, took just a few minutes.</p>
<p>I didn't upgrade to Catalina with my old laptop, because I wanted to play my 32bit Steam games, so macOS Big Sur is a quite a change for me now. A lot of setting up in the beginning, but all quite straightforward. A few surprises, such as zsh being the default shell in macOS now (change by <code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code>). Finally I can set Finder to sort by name AND have folders at the top, at the same time. For me as a person who switched to macOS from other systems, it has always felt so silly that this wasn't possible.</p>
<h3 id="touchid">TouchID<small><a href="#touchid" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>Having TouchID as part of the computer is a nice surprise. As a person who has sweaty hands all the time, I didn't believe it's gonna work. But it's actually able to read my fingers without any problems. The iPhone SE couldn't deal with my fingers. It was a source of a lot of frustrations and one of a few major reasons why I switched to iPhone X in Feb 2020, which has FaceID (only if the pandemics didn't bring face masks right after that).</p>
<p>It's very comfortable to use TouchID to login to the operating system, to 1Password, or to confirm a purchase in App Store (although that had to be first set up somewhere deep in the System Preferences, bah). Opening 1Password with a single finger touch is definitely a major productivity win for me.</p>
<h3 id="battery">Battery<small><a href="#battery" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>On Wednesday I tested the battery. 9am I unplugged the computer from electricity with 100% battery, and it started complaning about power only around 10pm. That's 13 hours. That said, during that day, I did mostly internet stuff, perhaps played some music, had 1 hour long call over MS Teams, 1 hour long call over Google Meet, and from 7pm to 10pm I attended an online meetup over Zoom. Before I connected to the meetup at 7pm, it still had almost 30 % battery left. Of course, no fan sound, as the machine has no fan, and it was only lukewarm between the keyboard and the display, cold everywhere else. Amazing!</p>
<h3 id="games">Games<small><a href="#games" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>On Black Friday I bought <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, but it would crash on my machine. On the Apple Silicon Air, even though I run the game through Rosetta 2, I've put all the sliders in the performance settings to the highest positions, and it runs so smooth that when moving the game camera I actually experience problems to get my head around so many details happening on my screen. It's beautiful. Of course, the machine makes no sound, as it has no fan.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://applesilicongames.com/">list of games which are optimized</a>, but I just installed Steam using Rosetta 2, downloaded the games I wanted through it, and didn't bother further.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup<small><a href="#setup" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew<small><a href="#homebrew" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>Setting up and figuring up Homebrew was a major drag, especially because my connection isn't very fast and initializing Homebrew downloads a lot of stuff over git, so it's endless. Before I found out the ideal configuration, I had to do it several times. I don't like Apple Store very much, so I only use it for installing apps which are not available as Homebrew casks, e.g. <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/lungo">Lungo</a>. I install everything else using Homebrew.</p>
<p>Homebrew suggests using it through Rosetta 2 (translation layer), which is fine, but I wanted to be able to also install apps which are already native to Apple Silicon. People post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM">tutorials on how to have two Homebrew installations side by side</a>, but it still took me some time to figure everyhting out. My setup after some trial and error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't bother installing CLI apps natively. <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">It's a mess now</a> and you'll only run into issues. Unless you want to help the Homebrew team with debugging, of course.</li>
<li>I ended up having the default Homebrew installed through Rosetta 2, and I install everything with it, both CLI and GUI apps,</li>
<li>except GUI <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">apps which are already optimized for the new Macs</a>, such as Firefox, Spotify, VS Code, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow the common advice on how to install Rosetta 2 Homebrew and how to install the native one. I won't repeat the many already existing tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM">Install Homebrew Natively on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac</a> (see also comments)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Three years ago, Jo and his wife Robin shared their story: he had early-onset Alzheimer's. Now, as it continues its swift, relentless assault on Jo, Robin navigates the unthinkable</p><div>
																		<p>Robin Giles is waiting at the entrance of her London, Ont., apartment building when the little white bus pulls up at the curb. The door to the lift swings open to reveal her husband, Joël Aubin, sitting in his wheelchair, grinning broadly at her. His arms undulate through what looks like a slow-motion drumming routine, and he snaps his ﬁngers continuously.</p>
<p>The wheelchair lift has jammed, and after the bus driver makes several attempts to get it working, she asks Robin if she can get Jo—as he’s known to most everyone in his life—off the bus without his chair. “We can <em>try</em>,” Robin says.</p>
<p>She climbs aboard, takes Jo’s hands in hers and coaches him to stand and follow her down the aisle. As is nearly always the case when Robin is within range, Jo’s gaze rarely strays from her. She backs down the bus steps and talks him down them one at a time. It takes Jo a couple of tries to climb the high curb, then he settles into the wheelchair the driver has extracted through the rear door.</p>
<p>Jo turns to Robin. “Holy s–t!” he exclaims. Robin and the bus driver roar with laughter.</p>
<p>This is the routine—minus the glitch with the lift and Jo’s perfect comedic expletive—every weekday around 3 p.m. During the school year, when Robin is teaching, her dad meets the bus every day when Jo returns from a day program, and Robin comes home soon after.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Jo was diagnosed with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, an extremely rare form caused by a genetic mutation slithering through his family tree. Jo watched his mother die of the same illness when he was a teenager. Even in this early-onset form of Alzheimer’s, Jo is a terrible rarity: <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html">he was 37 years old when he was diagnosed.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ THE FIRST STORY ABOUT JO: <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html">Jo Aubin has Alzheimer’s. He’s 38.</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Jo is 41 and Robin is 40, and they are navigating unthinkable territory. The “bastard monster,” as Robin sometimes calls Alzheimer’s, has been swift and relentless, but the assault has been particularly vicious in the last six months. Jo’s ability to speak has all but disappeared, his mobility is reduced to a slow, assisted shuffle around their apartment, and he requires hands-on help with every task of daily life, from dressing and brushing his teeth to eating and safely sitting down in a chair.</p>
<p>So far, with the help of her family, the day program and the sheer force of her own will and devotion to Jo, Robin has managed to provide all his caregiving at home. Families of people with dementia land in different places on this issue, but to her, it’s beyond question that Jo is not here anymore; most everything that made him Jo has been stolen. “But it’s almost like an echo that’s left,” she says. “It’s like I want to take care of <em>this</em> Jo because it’s honouring the real Jo.”</p>
<p>When she’s forced to move Jo into a nursing home and Robin loses her ability to care every day for the echo of the man she married, that will mean he’s really gone. “Sometimes people very kindly say, ‘Oh, it will be better when Jo is living somewhere else.’ No, it won’t. That’s the part that people don’t understand. It won’t be better. It will be the worst part,” she says through sobs. “Because I don’t consider what I’m doing a negative thing.”</p>
<p>But Robin knows a reckoning is imminent. And she also knows, because they talked about it many times before Jo lost the ability to have those conversations, that he despised the idea of going into a nursing home. In recent months, Robin felt compelled to put Jo on two waiting lists, but what haunts her is that he still seems so aware, she can’t imagine wrenching him from the peaceful, comfortable world they’ve built around him at home. There are still those fleeting moments—like his response to the ordeal of navigating the bus steps—when the old Jo resurfaces and announces himself with surprising clarity.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to the bus driver, Robin guides Jo’s wheelchair onto the elevator and pushes the button for their floor.</p>
<p>“He’s not ready to go anywhere yet,” she says. She looks at Jo, then reaches over and ruffles his hair.</p>

<p>More than two years before Jo was diagnosed, bizarre little glitches began to suggest something was terribly wrong. There were Christmas gifts that made no sense, problems with software he’d used for years or basic household tasks that went ignored. He saw his family doctor repeatedly, but medication and counselling—based on the assumption that the problem was depression or anxiety—went nowhere. Eventually, Jo was less able to teach high school—he was working at the same school as Robin—and their marriage frayed.</p>
<p>Finally, Jo’s doctor referred him to a specialist, and in June 2014 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. A year after his diagnosis, <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html"><em>Maclean’s</em> chronicled his story to that point.</a> Jo—so articulate that it had always been a running joke among his friends—struggled slightly to make words do his bidding, but he explained what it was like to live with dementia. “It’s kind of like you’re going through a forest,” he said. “And the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Jo was adamant that he didn’t want to end up in a long-term care facility like the one in which he’d visited his mother—sometimes with Robin along for the ride when they began dating as teenagers in Kapuskasing, Ont.—and he hoped that Canada’s legalization of assisted death would allow him to avoid that. But when medical assistance in dying became law in 2016, excluded were “advance requests” that would have permitted people with dementia to set out terms for their death while they still had capacity to consent.</p>
<p>Now, that dark forest Jo described is closing in. “In a lot of ways, it’s good that you don’t know what was coming, because if you knew, you would probably run away screaming,” Robin says. “But like everything else, it’s a progression where you look back and think, ‘I don’t know how we got here.’ ”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/politics/assisted-death-the-the-difficulties-around-demnetia/">The case for advance directives in assisted dying</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>She thinks of life in chapters divided by school years. Last fall, Jo’s mobility was fine, and they could still go to the movies or grocery shopping, though she had to ensure he stayed with the cart. He could no longer speak in full sentences then, but he could tell her his preference if she gave him options.</p>
<p>Now, Jo’s communication is mostly reduced to quiet, monosyllabic responses to yes-or-no questions, along with the occasional full phrase, often in humorous contexts. This spring, he began to use a wheelchair at the day program and on the bus, because he was having trouble navigating steps and had fallen occasionally when he misjudged the location of a chair.</p>
<p>Mostly, Jo looks like any guy in his early 40s and just like he always has, because even as he’s had to switch to comfortable clothing with no buttons or zippers, Robin has stuck close to his personal style; his wardrobe is still heavy on band T-shirts. But there’s a sort of veil in his gaze now and a relaxed softness in his facial features. When Instagram or Timehop present Robin with old photos, she can see some important source of light in Jo that’s gone now. A trip to the beach two years ago seemed ordinary, but when the photo appears, she can remember the day vividly: a postcard from another world where such things were possible. “It’s pretty devastating,” she says. “But also it’s nice to remember those times.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1145941"><p><img data-sizes="auto" src="https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MAC09_JO_HAS_ALZHEIMERS03.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="810"></p><p>Jo is fed lunch at McCormick Home. (Photograph by Chris Donovan )</p></div>
<p>Doctors often use the term “insight” to discuss whether a person with dementia is aware of their condition; some people come in for an appointment furious at a spouse who keeps insisting they’re losing track of things when they’re sure they’re not. Jo was acutely aware of his illness early on, and he and Robin talked about it often. “He was just frustrated by the hand he was dealt, and he was always, always worried about being a burden,” Robin says. “We would tell him, ‘You’re not.’ ” Jo stopped having those conversations about a year ago.</p>
<p>Robin has continued to work full-time out of financial necessity and to maintain a little island of normalcy with a job she loves. There are two big reasons she’s been able to do that and still care for Jo at home: the McCormick Dementia Services day program, and her father, Kip Giles. “I literally don’t know what I would do without him,” Robin says.</p>
<p>Three years ago, she called him in Kapuskasing and asked if he would consider moving in with them for the school year. “I immediately responded within a second or two, ‘Sure, of course,’” Kip says. Robin’s mother, Kathy, had died of complications from heart problems and pneumonia in January 2015, so Kip was on his own, and his reasoning for immediately saying yes matches Robin’s explanation for her devotion to Jo: when your family is in trouble, you’re there—that’s it. “Why sit up here, 1,100 km away and be by myself, when I know my daughter needs my help?” Kip says. “Realizing that I was going to be able to help in any way that I could made me feel like a parent.”</p>
<p>One of the first times Kip met Jo was shortly after he and Robin started dating in high school, when there was a party going on next door. “I wouldn’t say he was completely inebriated, but he stumbled in the front door,” Kip says, chuckling. “My wife and I both turned and said, ‘Oh yeah?’” Jo’s home life was rough, so he more or less moved in with Robin’s family.</p>
<p>Now, each fall when Kip returns to London after spending the summer at home, it’s jarring to see the changes. His first reaction is always anger at what’s happening to Jo, though he keeps it to himself. One of Robin’s frequent refrains is, “It is what it is.” And Kip thinks …</p></div></div>

<p>I was reading an amazing Twitter thread about Bill Grundfest, founder of The Comedy Cellar and the guy who discovered some of the most famous comedians.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Had a call yesterday with the guy who discovered and advised Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and just about every other famous comedian.</p><p>He utterly blew my mind with how he guided them early on in their careers to find their “signature move.”</p><p>Here’s everything he shared 👇</p></div>— Stew Fortier (@stewfortier) <a href="https://twitter.com/stewfortier/status/1316431056430657536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In the thread, which includes stories of Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and Ray Romano, the pattern is essentially:</p>



<ol><li>Bill is able to detect talent, even early on in people’s careers when they haven’t had success yet.</li><li>He’s able to zoom-in on what’s holding them back, and giving them one key piece of advice.</li><li>He <em>believed</em> in them.</li></ol>



<p>The thread focuses on the first two pieces: detecting talent and giving advice. The third piece is a little hidden, but in my mind, it’s probably the most impactful.</p>



<p>I’ve seen over and over in my career how having someone believe in you can be life-changing. I’ve sometimes been the recipient of that, sometimes a spectator, and most recently, I’ve tried to be a provider of that.</p>



<p>People can tell when you don’t believe in them, and they can tell when you do. It has an effect on their behavior, and can be self-fulfilling. This is sometimes known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">Pygmalion effect</a>. Having someone believe in you is tremendously powerful. If someone believes in you, they will give you more support and more opportunity. They will boost your confidence—and I’ve seen lack of confidence hold back way too many brilliant people. And they will help create the type of <strong>psychological safety</strong> necessary for you to do your best work.</p>



<p><em>So here’s my rule as a manager. I only hire people I believe in, and I do my best to let them know I believe in them.</em></p>



<p>Just because someone has been successful, or has a lot of experience, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I believe in them. Believing in someone means that <strong>I believe their best is yet to come.</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, believing in someone doesn’t always mean believing that they will be successful right away, or that they will be successful in the exact way or role I’ve intended for them. Believing in someone isn’t relaxing my standards or expectations of them either. That’s the <em>opposite </em>of believing in someone. In order to believe in someone, you need to maintain high standards for them, and have faith that they will meet those standards.</p>



<p>This applies beyond just managers hiring their teams. If you have the luxury of choosing where you work, you are essentially “hiring” a person as your manager, a team as your colleagues, or a company as your employer. So if you can, always choose to work with people you believe in, and people who believe in you. Work with people for whom you believe their best is yet to come. And if you lose faith in them, or you feel like they lose faith in you, do them and yourself the favor of moving on.</p>

        <p>Humans are culture creation machines. We stumble on some idea or thought, share it with other humans, and if the idea sticks and spreads faster than we forget about it, it becomes embedded in the way we do things together in the future. These are your inside jokes, your traditions and your cults. Many such ideas disappear as soon as they come, like fashion trends and popular culture. Some great ones stick around for a while and influence history, like Jazz or the Enlightenment. The few most powerful ones, like religion and democracy, embed themselves into the DNA of civilization, and they become <em>institutions</em>, inseparable from the species that conceived of it in the first place. Institutions are much harder to replace than other kinds of culture, because they go beyond simply being a part of life, and take root as an <em>infrastructural</em> piece of the way we navigate the world. They are fabric, more than threads. These institutions are pieces of culture immortalized. There’s nothing inherently inevitable about them – they are immortalized into humanity by virtue of their staying power in the way we live, and by how effectively they spread themselves amongst our communities.</p>
<p>One important invention of civilization is the university – a place with cultural and economic implications so complex I couldn’t possibly do it justice in one blog post. The university is an invention – there’s nothing fundamentally inevitable about it. The university is also an object of culture – universities play different roles in society and economy and life in different parts of the world, and at different points in history. The university is arbitrary in this way, but it’s also fundamental to the way the world works. The four-year research university has weaved itself deep into the fabric of society, from immigration and visa policies to the way science gets done to the coming-of-age culture in most developed countries. If it’s not an <em>institution</em> of civilization today, it’s rapidly becoming one.</p>
<p>But fundamental as it is, the university is still a human invention, and I still think it can be replaced. We can invent other ideas that compete in the same gene pool of culture and the same market for value, that might out-compete it to become a more dominant way we learn and build careers and find relationships. What would that new idea look like?</p>
<p>What would it take to <em>kill the university</em>?</p>
<p>Many smarter minds that I have tried to tackle this question from a problem of pure economic value proposition. When we study the university as a product – something that students pay to reap benefits of education, network, career development, and personal growth – it makes sense to try to invent ideas that compete in providing those values. So we invented better ways to learn, in the modern trade schools and bootcamps. We are inventing better ways to find a network, in cohort-based education products and professional communities. I think we’re still early in the rise of companies offering many other services in the university “package”, but it’s a matter of time.</p>
<p>No matter how competitive the newcomers to the scene, though, I think approaching the university as a bundled package of value propositions like this is only a part of the innovation. The best feature of the four-year research university isn’t career or education or personal development <em>per se</em>, but the <em>ultimate community</em>: a lifelong identity tied to a physical place, with thousands of other people, harboring hundreds of distinct self-sustaining tribes mired in decades and centuries of tradition and stories and identities. The university survives as a core <em>community infrastructure</em> of society, not just a company offering a product.</p>
<p>To kill the university, someone new must beat them at this game. Someone needs to invent a better way to build and grow this super-community of communities.</p>

<p>Universities are some of the richest, most complex communities I’ve studied, due to their place in most people’s lives. Universities claim four years, nearly full-time, of the most formative and socially instrumental period of most of our lives, and generations overlap each other going back decades, often centuries. This makes it something akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_soup">primordial soup</a> of communities and identities that will last the lifetime of students. All of the best ingredients for forming lasting, powerful communities are present in university campuses: a physical place, people willing to build new relationships, a shared common goal, sufficient diversity, an influx of new community members every year, and numerous activities for people to do together and build a collective identity. I could hardly imagine a more promising hotbed from which communities can spontaneously arise.</p>
<p>But a good university isn’t just one deep and lasting community. It’s a <strong>super-community</strong>, hosting the births of many more infinitely diverse communities every year interlinked by a higher level common identity of the university campus. This aspect of the university community, the <strong>ability to birth and grow new independent communities over time</strong>, is the best feature of universities.</p>
<p>I’ve written before about how <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/cellular-communities/">communities can scale by growing a hierarchy of smaller “cells” of sub-communities</a>. Many large communities are structured this way to become sustainable (imagine any regional chapter-based organization, as an easy example). The university, though, is one step above this. Because the kinds of communities created within universities are so culturally and topically diverse, many sub-communities brewed within universities grow to become great communities in their own right, creating impact in the world independently of the larger university community.</p>
<p>Included in this category of sub-communities are labs and academic groups, but also less formal kinds of communities like clubs, and the smaller networks of people that might exist within them. These sub-communities can be centered around any number of topics and purpose, from fraternities to career-oriented student organizations. The best of these sub-communities sustain themselves through generations of members who help each other navigate the life outside of the university, building each other’s careers and providing the community with a sense of direction and purpose. Because universities often claim the prime years of students' lives, these communities tend to have outsized impact to their members compared to other communities they’ll join in the future. The communities you join and build during the university years will carry for years and decades.</p>
<p>Even for those students less involved in communities and clubs in college, university communities end up shaping where they go next for work and life, and often determine the way they make sense of the world politically, philosophically, academically, and financially.</p>
<p>Good universities are factories for such communities. Beyond a career prospect or a well-rounded education or even a personal network, universities nurture these communities and provide them with fresh classes of potential new members every year, in a nearly guaranteed, self-sustaining cycle. No other piece of our culture meets the same challenge at the same scale. In this way, universities are a critical piece of the <em>community infrastructure</em> of the modern world.</p>

<p>Many years ago, at the start of my career, at a panel on entrepreneurship, I asked one of the investors gathered on stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the productive innovation ecosystems I’ve encountered are built around universities. Do you think this is inevitable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my surprise, they answered, “yes.” They told me it was obvious that great startup ecosystems only form with universities at the hub of the flywheel of capital and network. I took their answer with reluctance at the time, but asking myself the same question now, it’s startlingly obvious. Universities don’t just produce research and new knowledge. Universities also produce communities and networks of optimistic and ambitious people that fuel entrepreneurial communities. These people, pulled up by their predecessors and their alumni, found new ventures. And when the best of them succeed, they’ll pull the successors in their communities to fill their shoes. And the flywheel keeps turning. Universities are <strong>community engines</strong>, attracting students from around the state or the world and producing networks and communities of people vectored towards similar purpose.</p>
<p>Productive engines as they are, universities are flawed. They’re expensive, inefficient bureaucracies that are often inequitable. I have confidence universities can be disrupted, and new, stronger ideas will take their place in society in due time – the imperfections are too fatal in the long term to brush away. There is no shortage of interesting companies and experimental policies trying to find alternatives to universities as a <em>product</em>. But whatever takes the place of universities will also have to fill the role they currently play to the communities that grow around and beyond it, into the rest of the world. And fortunately to those who manage to reinvent this community engine, with a strong and growing community by your side, building great products become much less risky.</p>
<p>Of the many ways universities tie into the fabric of our modern life, I think the most complex, and the most under-appreciated today, is that universities are astonishingly prolific, self-sustaining community factories. The reinvention of the university is inevitable, but a long road stretches ahead, and the job will not be complete until we build ourselves a better community engine.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, December 15th, 2020, Twitch officially announced that the term “simp” (along with “incel” and “virgin”) are now against the platform’s terms of services. The news spread quickly across the live streaming community which led to plenty of discussions and, of course, memes. However, the banning didn’t seem to stop Twitch users from testing the limits of the new ToS additions. Adversely, the banning led to an increase of “simp” mentions in chat to almost double the previous 15 day average. Gaming slang is often hard to control but only time will tell if Twitch can phase the term out of its users’ vocabulary. </p>



<ul><li>Prior to the banning, “simp” mentions averaged 71K mentions per day before skyrocketing to 140K on December 16th.</li><li>Streamers with emotes containing the word “simp” will now need to remove and replace them to follow ToS guidelines.</li><li>“Simp” now joins a list of words, terms, and phrases that are banned on Twitch for being derogatory, racist, sexist, or harmful. </li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            

                            <p>
                                Friday December 18, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/cristian-adam">Cristian Adam</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>On 18th of November Kitware, has released CMake version 3.19. The <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/release/3.19.html">release notes</a> contain the list of changes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Below you have some changes that caught my attention:</p>

<p>Configuring a Qt CMake project from command line requires the presence of a few mandatory arguments. For example:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=c:/Qt/6.0.0/mingw81_64 -S . -B build
</code></pre>
<p>And usually some more <code>-D</code> arguments with specific options like <code>-DQT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON</code> or <code>-DFEATURE_system_zlib=OFF</code> and the command line becomes very long.</p>
<p>Scripts end up being used, which differ from developer to developer, and they might or not be cross-platform.</p>
<p>CMake 3.19 comes with support for <code>CMakePresets.json</code> and <code>CMakeUserPresets.json</code> files which help in this regard.</p>
<p>Here is an preset example that will build using the MinGW 8.1 compiler:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "version": 1,
  "cmakeMinimumRequired": {
    "major": 3,
    "minor": 19,
    "patch": 0
  },
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "mingw",
      "displayName": "Ninja with MinGW 8.1",
      "generator": "Ninja",
      "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release",
        "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "c:/Qt/6.0.0/mingw81_64"
      },
      "environment": {
        "PATH": "c:/Qt/Tools/Ninja;c:/Qt/Tools/mingw810_64/bin;$penv{PATH}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, building a project resorts to just: <code>
cmake -S . --preset=mingw
</code></p>
<p>This has been tracked as <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21164">issue #21164</a>, and documented at <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/manual/cmake-presets.7.html">cmake-presets(7)</a></p>

<p>The Xcode generator now uses the Xcode “new build system” when generating for Xcode 12.0 or higher. See <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/variable/CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM.html">CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM</a> variable for Xcode build system selection.</p>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/18088">#18088</a></p>
<p>Apple Silicon is now supported (since CMake 3.19.2). See <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/variable/CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR.html">CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR</a> for selecting an architecture different than <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/variable/CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.html">CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</a> detected by CMake.</p>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21554">#21554</a></p>

<p>For those using Clang 11 and onwards, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/prop_tgt/PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES.html">PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</a> target property was added to enable template instantiation in the precompiled header.</p>
<p>This is enabled by default and may significantly improve compilation times.</p>
<p>For example, building Qt6Base with no examples / tests on my Lenovo A485 Ryzen 7 laptop running Windows 10 with <a href="https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw">Clang-MinGW</a> 11, CMake 3.19.2. The values below are the median from four times.</p>
<p><code>-DCMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES=OFF</code></p>
<pre><code>* build time: 919.5 s
* pch size: 397 MB
</code></pre>
<p><code>-DCMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES=ON</code> (default)</p>
<pre><code>* build time: 792.75 s
* pch size: 455 MB
</code></pre>
<p>That is a 13.78% speed increase, while having a 14.61% pch size increase.</p>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21133">#21133</a></p>

<p>The <code>string()</code> command gained a set of new <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/command/string.html#json">JSON sub commands</a> that provide JSON parsing capabilities.</p>
<p>For example, parsing the <code>CMakePresets.json</code> above to get the <code>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>file(READ CMakePresets.json cmakePresetsJson)
string(JSON prefixPath GET "${cmakePresetsJson}" configurePresets 0 cacheVariables CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH)
message("prefixPath: ${prefixPath}")
</code></pre>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/19501">#19501</a></p>

<p>The <code>cmake_language()</code> command gained a <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/command/cmake_language.html#defer">DEFER</a> mode to schedule command calls to occur at the end of processing a directory.</p>
<p>This way, we can call a function at the end of configuration of a <code>CMakeList.txt</code> file, for example printing a summary of <code>find_package</code> calls:</p>
<pre><code>function(at_exit)
  include(FeatureSummary)
  feature_summary(INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES WHAT
    PACKAGES_FOUND PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
    ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES
  )
endfunction()
cmake_language(DEFER CALL at_exit)
</code></pre>
<p>This feature has been tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/19575">issue #19575</a> and allowed implementing some of Qt6’s functionality.</p></span></p>

Sanity UI is a component library built with React for use in composing useful, beautiful, and accessible user interfaces. We're excited to announce early access to Sanity UI. For developers and designers, this means it has now become easier to craft custom inputs and tools that are consistent with Sanity Studio.</p><p>You can start with Sanity UI with the latest version of the studio. <a href="https://www.sanity.io/ui">Go to the documentation site</a> to learn more about its components and usage.</p><p>Sanity UI can be used outside of the Studio too. We used it ourselves to accelerate <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/early-access-manage">the full rewrite of the project and team dashboards</a> (out in beta). </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure><div data-block-key="04e01fd58869"><h2><a id="why-we-built-our-own-component-library-04e01fd58869"></a><a href="#why-we-built-our-own-component-library-04e01fd58869"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Why we built our own component library</h2></div><p>Design systems enable teams of designers and developers to move quickly from prototyping in design tools to creating interactive interfaces for validation, testing, and use. They allow a team to encode UI choices into code and stay on the same page. Design systems also help keep things consistent and create great efficiencies when working on new features.</p><p>Thatâ€™s the case for all design systems and component libraries. Why did we decide to build our own?</p><p>Every design system comes with the opinions of its creators. Making a system like this requires making choices as to what is most important. So, instead of relying on a third-party system to power our products and sites, we struck out to write one that codified our design thoughts.</p><div data-block-key="9749062d92d4"><h3><a id="sanity-ui-is-structured-and-composable-9749062d92d4"></a><a href="#sanity-ui-is-structured-and-composable-9749062d92d4"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Sanity UI is structured and composable</h3></div><p>Like with content, the more you think through how your system is structured, the more flexible it becomes. With constraints come freedom. Structured content is at the heart of Sanity, so it only makes sense that the heart of our design system should be of highly composable, structured components.</p><p>These UI primitives allow for a high level of composition. Each primitive only brings exactly the props it needs to function and do its job. When you combine them, you can find unexpected and powerful patterns.</p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure><div data-block-key="07fbde971ddd"><h3><a id="sanity-ui-is-accessibility-focused-07fbde971ddd"></a><a href="#sanity-ui-is-accessibility-focused-07fbde971ddd"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Sanity UI is accessibility-focused</h3></div><p>In our research, it felt like many design systems were focused on making things look their best and then focusing on accessibility. For Sanity UI, we wanted to make sure we treated accessibility as a key feature and constraint for our designs. From default color schemes to carefully designed focus rings and states, accessibility is baked in.</p><p>Not every interaction comes with browser-defined accessibility. For interactive components, like dialogs, buttons, and autocomplete, we worked directly from the WAI-ARIA guidelines and patterns and tested each one using screen readers.</p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure><p>Creating custom interfaces makes Sanity Studio powerful for teams to define out new workflows or ways of managing data. Borrowing from the JavaScript approach to content modeling in the Studio, the theming Sanity UI will work the same way. The interface is completely defined in JavaScript, including theming and CSS.</p><p>Design and development teams can often feel like theyâ€™re speaking different languages. When language differs, miscommunication can often be the outcome. At Sanity, we believe the best products and sites are created by the intersection of disciplines. </p><p>Sanity UI is built by both designers-who-code, as well as engineers that take great pride in a solid user experience. The UI primitives, components, and properties have all been named extremely carefully. The goal is to create a system where components are named to evoke terms designers understand at use, while giving logical aspects that are familiar to developers.</p><p>With a common language, common components, and a common goal, we think all things are possible.</p><div data-block-key="edb30761f246"><h2><a id="get-started-with-early-access-edb30761f246"></a><a href="#get-started-with-early-access-edb30761f246"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Get started with early access</h2></div><p>Sanity UI is a work in progress, but is already making feature development easier at Sanity.

We've built <a href="https://sanity.io/ui">a full documentation site</a>, complete with interactive code playground, reference docs, and guides for getting started.

We'd love to get any and all feedback. <a href="https://slack.sanity.io/">Join the Slack community</a> and post in our #beta channel if you need help or want to provide insight into how you're using Sanity UI.</p><p>The next few months will be exciting times as we release new features around Sanity UI, including many new data bindings, components, patterns, and more.</p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I’ve published a blog post every one of the past 100 weekdays. That’s 20 weeks of daily blogging. I wrote <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/">a post about it after 8 weeks</a>, so here’s another one.</p>



<p>It’s fair to say this habit has changed my life.</p>



<ul><li>I realized I needed to look for a new job <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/10/what-the-heck-do-i-even-want/">while writing a blog post</a>. 3 months later (2 weeks ago), I started my new job.</li><li>I realized I am an extrovert, not an introvert <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/27/am-i-an-extrovert-or-an-introvert/">while writing a blog post</a>, which fundamentally <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/23/death-to-small-talk/">changed my interactions with people</a>.</li><li>That led me to understand that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">I have mild social anxiety</a>. Since then, I’ve gotten much better at making <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/17/values-pick-2/">value-based</a> choices rather than avoidance-based.</li><li>Just 2 days ago, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/16/if-everyone-else-on-earth-disappeared-how-would-you-spend-your-time/">a post of mine</a> led to some fascinating and hilarious discussions, including <a href="https://anchor.fm/jace-and-critter/">the first episode of a podcast</a> I’m putting together with a friend.</li><li>I’ve crystallized <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">dozens</a> of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">random</a> <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/23/parenting-doesnt-do-what-i-thought/">thoughts</a> and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">ideas</a>, because writing is thinking. And I’ve made connections that I never would have made otherwise. I’m not sure if I would have gotten my new job if I hadn’t already thought through answers to lots of the interview questions while writing blog posts.</li><li>I’ve made new friends with people who found a post and contacted me about it.</li></ul>



<p>It’s life changing, and it’s fun. I look forward to it every time. </p>



<p>In terms of stats, these 100 posts have gotten about 96,000 views so far. 67,000 of those views came from the top 5 posts:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/11/that-coworker-who-never-stops-refactoring/">That coworker who never stops&nbsp;refactoring</a>: 23,722 views</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/10/wiki-bankruptcy/">Wiki bankruptcy</a>: 17,998 views</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/26/5-second-feedback/">5 second feedback</a>: 12,731 views</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">Plan the sprint, not the&nbsp;project</a>: 7,571</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">Your calendar should be an allowlist, not a&nbsp;blocklist</a>: 4,969</li></ul>



<p>The 80/20 rule at work, as always.</p>



<p>When I try to convince people to try it, they say they don’t have time or they will run out of topics. Well, prove it! <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">Try it as an experiment</a>! </p>



<p>Here’s what I do:</p>



<ol><li>Whenever I have an interesting thought or come across an idea in a book that resonates, I make it the title of an empty blog draft. (Bonus: this helps to remember what I read!)</li><li>Every morning, when I sit down at the computer, I pick one of those drafts and write about it. Just ramble, who cares! If it’s crap, I’ll write another one tomorrow anyway.</li><li>Publish, then get started with my work day.</li></ol>



<p>That’s it. Simple, as the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">best processes always are</a>. Anyone can do it.</p>



<p>Try it for a week and see if you want to keep it going. <a href="https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/">It only gets easier as you go</a>.</p>

						<p>At the University of Copenhagen, researchers have discovered two fungal species that infect adult flies and create a hole in the abdomen of their hosts' bodies. The fungi actually live inside the flies eating them from within as they move around.The species of fly targeted by the fungi happen to be fly eaters themselves.</p><p>The two species, <em>Strongwellsea acerosa </em>and<em> </em><em>Strongwellsea tigrinae, </em>have been discovered in the Capital Area of Denmark with "S. tigrinae" in Jægerspris and "S. acerosa" in Amager.</p><p>"This is an exciting and bizarre aspect of biodiversity that we have discovered in Denmark", says Prof. Jørgen Eilenberg of the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/fos--ttf121520.php">according to EurekAlert</a>. "In and of itself, this mapping of new and unknown biodiversity is valuable. But at the same time, this is basic new knowledge that can serve as a basis for experimental studies of infection pathways and the bioactive substances involved."</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Fly" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@osomax?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Gabriel Manlake</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Two Danish species of fly infect the fungi (Coenosia tigrina and Coenosia testacea). They create a hole in their infected hosts' abdomen. For several days, flying moves are released from the hole as fungal spores are released and are drifting towards new victims. For instance, if a fly is going by, it risks getting infected. The fungi are fed from the back of the fly's body to their very ends. The fly lies behind it after a few days and spasms its final hours.</p><p>These fungi's ability to keep flies fresh as long as they are eaten from within for days has led researchers to speculate that these fungi can create substances that "dope" their hosts. Analysis of other fungi infecting cicadas indicates that drugs similar to amphetamines are involved.</p>

<p>This is the mixing desk used by George Martin for the Beatles’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sergeant Pepper album (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krnPj-jjpWY" target="_blank">Sergeant Pepper album</a>. You’ll notice the mixing desk has just 4 channels. Compare this to modern-day studios, where producers have access to unlimited channels of audio thanks to computers and digital audio workstations. It took just 4 tracks and creative tape manipulation to produce this masterpiece of an album. Modern-day producers: Take a screenshot of this image for inspiration and as a reminder of what’s possible with less in a world of overproduction. </p>

<p>Daphne Oram was co-founder of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/story-bbc-radiophonic-workshop" target="_blank">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a> and a pioneer of musique concrète in the UK. In 1948, intrigued by the possibilities of manipulating magnetic tape, Oram began building special equipment for experiments. Those experiments led Oram to create a unique technique dubbed “Oramics.” In Oram’s words: “Oramics consisted of drawing onto a set of ten sprocketed synchronized strips of 35mm film which covered a series of photo-electric cells that in turn generated an electrical charge to control the sound frequency, timbre, amplitude and duration.” Incredible music experimentalist.

<p>Transforming black-and-white images from the past to show music creators and studios in color is interesting. What would be even more interesting? Resurrecting audio from the past that’s currently unplayable and locked inside encrypted objects like disks, cylinders, and other audio relics from the past.

    <section>
      <div id="preamble">
<div>

<p>Before we start, think about this question: do we really need the inverse of a general matrix?</p>
<p>I came to this problem when writing a math library for my game engine. If you are making a game or 3D application, we use 4x4 matrix for object transform, which is a combination of 3D translation, rotation and scale. If most of your matrices are used as transform matrices, because of their special property, we have a fast route for calculating their inverse. In fact transform matrix inverse is only 50% of the cost compared to the optimized general matrix inverse. In the first half of this post we will talk about transform matrix.  In the second half we will dive in and explain the SIMD version of general 4x4 matrix inverse, and we compare the performance of our method with commonly used math libraries from UE4, Eigen and DirectX Math.</p>
<p>The matrices used in this post are row major. This is mainly for (1) easier to demonstrate and visualize with matrix data layout; (2) easier to compare with other math library. The same matrix inverse function works for both row major and column major, because \(A^{-1}=((A^{T})^{-1})^{T}\) (inverse is the same as transpose, inverse then transpose again). However if you are a column major guy like myself, I have a full-on column major version for you in <a href="#Appendix">[Appendix]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_transform_matrix_inverse">Transform Matrix Inverse</h3>
<p>The transform matrix we are talking about here is defined as following:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M=\left( \begin{matrix} a\vec{X} &amp; 0 \\ b\vec{Y} &amp; 0 \\ c\vec{Z} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{T} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} aX_0 &amp; aX_1 &amp; aX_2 &amp; 0 \\ bY_0 &amp; bY_1 &amp; bY_2 &amp; 0 \\ cZ_0 &amp; cZ_1 &amp; cZ_2 &amp; 0 \\ T_0 &amp; T_1 &amp; T_2 &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>The first 3 component of the last row is the translation \(\vec{T}\). The top left 3x3 sub-matrix is the scaled rotation matrix, with each row as a scaled axis. We have \(\vec{X}\cdot\vec{Y}=\vec{X}\cdot\vec{Z}=\vec{Y}\cdot\vec{Z}=0\), and \(\left|\vec{X}\right|=\left|\vec{Y}\right|=\left|\vec{Z}\right|=1\). And the scale is \((a,b,c)\).</p>
<p>Most matrices in the game are of this form. For example, \(M\) represents a local to world transform, \(\vec{X}\), \(\vec{Y}\), \(\vec{Z}\) are your local space axes. If you have a point \(\vec{P}(P_0,P_1,P_2)\), and you want to transform it from local space to world space, you do this:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[\vec{P'}=P_0a\vec{X}+P_1b\vec{Y}+P_2c\vec{Z}+\vec{T}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>This is the same as extend \(\vec{P}\) to a 4 component vector \(\vec{P}(P_0,P_1,P_2,1)\) and multiply by matrix \(M\). Now what does inverse matrix \(M^{-1}\) mean? In this case it represents a world to local transform, so if we multiply \(\vec{P'}\) by \(M^{-1}\), we should get \(\vec{P}\) back. How do we transform the point \(\vec{P'}\) from world space back in local space? We subtract the local space origin (aka the translation \(\vec{T}\)), then dot each axes to get its local space coordinate and rescale it:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[\begin{align*}
\vec{P}&amp;=(\frac{1}{a}(\vec{P'}-\vec{T})\cdot\vec{X},\frac{1}{b}(\vec{P'}-\vec{T})\cdot\vec{Y},\frac{1}{c}(\vec{P'}-\vec{T})\cdot\vec{Z})\\
&amp;=(\frac{1}{a}\vec{P'}\cdot\vec{X},\frac{1}{b}\vec{P'}\cdot\vec{Y},\frac{1}{c}\vec{P'}\cdot\vec{Z})-(\frac{1}{a}\vec{T}\cdot\vec{X},\frac{1}{b}\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Y},\frac{1}{c}\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Z})
\end{align*}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>With this, we can actually directly write the form of the inverse of our matrix.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M^{-1}=\left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{a}\vec{X} &amp; \frac{1}{b}\vec{Y} &amp; \frac{1}{c}\vec{Z} &amp; \vec{0} \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{a}\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{b}\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{c}\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{a}X_0 &amp; \frac{1}{b}Y_0 &amp; \frac{1}{c}Z_0 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{1}{a}X_1 &amp; \frac{1}{b}Y_1 &amp; \frac{1}{c}Z_1 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{1}{a}X_2 &amp; \frac{1}{b}Y_2 &amp; \frac{1}{c}Z_2 &amp; 0 \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{a}\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{b}\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{c}\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>The nice thing about transform matrix \(M\) is its first 3 rows are perpendicular to each other. Its inverse form is basically transpose the 3x3 rotation matrix, and rescale it, and change translation part by doing dot product with 3 rescaled axes. It should be easy to confirm \(MM^{-1}=I\).</p>
<p>Now let’s bake in the scale (so \(\left|\vec{X}\right|=a\),\(\left|\vec{Y}\right|=b\),\(\left|\vec{Z}\right|=c\)) and get a more generic form.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M=\left( \begin{matrix} \vec{X} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{Y} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{Z} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{T} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right), M^{-1}=\left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{{\left|\vec{X}\right|}^{2}}\vec{X} &amp; \frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Y}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Y} &amp; \frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Z}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Z} &amp; \vec{0} \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{{\left|\vec{X}\right|}^{2}}\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Y}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Z}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that for rescaling, we divide by squared size of scaled axis, instead of size, which is good news for implementation. And if our transform is of unit scale, which is also common in games, our target becomes even simpler.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M^{-1}=\left( \begin{matrix} \vec{X} &amp; \vec{Y} &amp; \vec{Z} &amp; \vec{0} \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>

<p>Alright, enough theory, let’s see some code. This is our matrix definition.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">__declspec(align(16)) struct Matrix4

	union
	{
		float m[4][4];
		__m128 mVec[4];
	};
};</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before we jump in intrinsics, I would like to define a bunch of shuffle/swizzle macros. Hopefully they will make it easier to read. We also make use of faster instructions for special shuffles.</p>
<p>(Thank you <strong>Stefan Kaps</strong> for pointing out single register shuffle instruction _mm_shuffle_epi32!)</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">#define MakeShuffleMask(x,y,z,w)           (x | (y&lt;&lt;2) | (z&lt;&lt;4) | (w&lt;&lt;6))

// vec(0, 1, 2, 3) -&gt; (vec[x], vec[y], vec[z], vec[w])
#define VecSwizzleMask(vec, mask)          _mm_castsi128_ps(_mm_shuffle_epi32(_mm_castps_si128(vec), mask))
#define VecSwizzle(vec, x, y, z, w)        VecSwizzleMask(vec, MakeShuffleMask(x,y,z,w))
#define VecSwizzle1(vec, x)                VecSwizzleMask(vec, MakeShuffleMask(x,x,x,x))
// special swizzle
#define VecSwizzle_0022(vec)               _mm_moveldup_ps(vec)
#define VecSwizzle_1133(vec)               _mm_movehdup_ps(vec)

// return (vec1[x], vec1[y], vec2[z], vec2[w])
#define VecShuffle(vec1, vec2, x,y,z,w)    _mm_shuffle_ps(vec1, vec2, MakeShuffleMask(x,y,z,w))

#define VecShuffle_2323(vec1, vec2)        _mm_movehl_ps(vec2, vec1)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is our first function to inverse transform matrix without scaling (always unit scale).</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">// Requires this matrix to be transform matrix, NoScale version requires this matrix be of scale 1
inline Matrix4 GetTransformInverseNoScale(const Matrix4&amp; inM)
{
	Matrix4 r;

	// transpose 3x3, we know m03 = m13 = m23 = 0
	__m128 t0 = VecShuffle_0101(inM.mVec[0], inM.mVec[1]); // 00, 01, 10, 11
	__m128 t1 = VecShuffle_2323(inM.mVec[0], inM.mVec[1]); // 02, 03, 12, 13
	r.mVec[0] = VecShuffle(t0, inM.mVec[2], 0,2,0,3); // 00, 10, 20, 23(=0)
	r.mVec[1] = VecShuffle(t0, inM.mVec[2], 1,3,1,3); // 01, 11, 21, 23(=0)
	r.mVec[2] = VecShuffle(t1, inM.mVec[2], 0,2,2,3); // 02, 12, 22, 23(=0)

	// last line
	r.mVec[3] =                       _mm_mul_ps(r.mVec[0], VecSwizzle1(inM.mVec[3], 0));
	r.mVec[3] = _mm_add_ps(r.mVec[3], _mm_mul_ps(r.mVec[1], VecSwizzle1(inM.mVec[3], 1)));
	r.mVec[3] = _mm_add_ps(r.mVec[3], _mm_mul_ps(r.mVec[2], VecSwizzle1(inM.mVec[3], 2)));
	r.mVec[3] = _mm_sub_ps(_mm_setr_ps(0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f), r.mVec[3]);

	return r;
}</code></pre>

<p>Very straight forward. This is the fastest function you can have, it only does a transpose and some dot products. If we add in scales, it takes a little more time to do rescaling, but still pretty fast. There is a little trick for calculating squared size, we can make use of the fact that we need to transpose 3x3 rotation part anyway, do squared size after and calculate 3 axes in one go.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">#define SMALL_NUMBER		(1.e-8f)

                <div>
                    <p>Choosing Hibernate when your Java code interacts with SQL databases is widely considered the default choice. We however use the JOOQ code generator instead. Here are some of the reasons why we think it's a better choice.</p><p><strong>Schema Definition</strong></p><p>In an ideal case, you write the schema for your database in native SQL dialect, using all of your database's special features. The language-specific code is then generated off of that schema. This is what JOOQ does.</p><p>With an ORM, you end up defining your schema in Java-specific 'entity' classes using a whole bunch of annotations. &nbsp;Not only do you give up on any special features of your database's DDL, but you also now have to learn this Hibernate specific Annotation-based DSL to define your schema. It's the worst of all worlds.</p><p><strong>Transparent SQL</strong></p><p>You want the SQL statement being sent to your database as explicit and transparent as possible. ORMs turn this dial the opposite way. Many times one has to turn on debug level logging just to see what SQL statements are being generated by Hibernate code. Things like when a foreign key reference in an entity is causing data to be loaded lazily or not can be very opaque.</p><p>Not to mention, advanced database-specific functionality, like Common Table Expressions, can be tough to use with Hibernate and will probably require you to fallback to hardcoded SQL strings anyway.</p><p>JOOQ generated classes allow you to write code that looks exactly like the SQL being generated while still being type-safe. This gives you the type safety of Java while providing transparency into the query and not needing you to learn a whole new annotation-based DSL.</p><p><strong>CRUD classes</strong></p><p>The one place where ORMs shine is doing simple CRUD operations. In this case, just assigning some fields to an object and calling <code>.save()</code> on it is far simpler than manually generating <code>INSERT</code> statements. Similarly for doing simple <code>SELECT</code>s. JOOQ acknowledges this and also generates basic entity classes for each table that allow you to do the simple CRUD operations easily.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The object-relational impedance mismatch has been a subject of much debate with ORMs like Hibernate. We think JOOQ takes the right approach to solving this problem. We wish JOOQ also generated code for languages other than Java.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="DuckTools: AWS Cost Optimization"><div>
<p>Starting from the day The Duckbill Group opened its doors, we’ve been pretty down on SaaS tools that purport to save money on the AWS bill. We’ve had several reasons that were responsible for our distaste:</p>



<ul><li>They all charge a staggering amount of money but don’t actually solve anything for you. “Yup, here’s a graph of the money you’re spending split on a new and exciting axis. Please pay me 2% of your bill in perpetuity!”</li><li>They all give the same unhelpful advice. If you’re using one of them, ask yourself sincerely: what has your AWS bill done since you rolled it out? We both know the answer.</li><li>They all are building something massive and all-encompassing, 80% of which you’ll never use.</li></ul>



<p>We’ve long believed that the most impactful place for lowering and managing AWS costs is deep into the architecture–where software can’t help–and thus Duckbill has focused on a consulting services model rather than building yet another SaaS tool. </p>



<p>As we went about helping our customers on consulting engagements, our Cloud Economists were simultaneously writing a bunch of Python scripts to address specific challenges of AWS cost management for use with specific problems we kept encountering on our client projects.</p>



<p>The tools that we built became more and more fleshed out, and now it seems that this can help people who aren’t quite ready for our deep-dive consulting services yet.</p>







<p>DuckTools is a suite of tools aimed to solve specific problems. We’re launching with two DuckTools Apps with many more planned. These apps are simple, because you shouldn’t need multiple days of training to understand what they do. They’re highly focused and easier to use. They’re not a panacea; they’re what we use internally on our consulting engagements. And we’re making them available to you.</p>



<p>Oh, and the best part: Unlike pretty much every other option out there, we charge a fixed monthly fee for these apps, regardless of how big or small your AWS bill is. We don’t feel we need to charge you a couple of million bucks a year just because you spun up more EC2 instances than someone else did.</p>



<h2>Savings Plan Calculator</h2>



<p>One of the biggest frustrations our clients have with Savings Plans is determining and modeling the right commitment level for a Savings Plan purchase. The AWS Savings Plan Recommendation system provides options to bootstrap a recommendation on the basis of the past 7 days, past 30 days, or past 60 days, and then provides an hourly commit to cover the compute for that time.</p>



<p>This leaves some very important questions unanswered:</p>



<ul><li>What do the savings and total spend look like if the customer purchases half the recommended commit? No idea–the console can’t tell you. You’ll save “some money,” but how much is anyone’s guess.</li><li>What if the best bootstrap period was a specific seven day window last month? Sucks for you, because the console can’t handle arbitrary date ranges.</li></ul>



<p>We thought those limitations were silly, so we completely reverse-engineered Savings Plans and built a proper calculator. Our calculator handles arbitrary data ranges, offers a full visualization, and features sliders to help customers do scenario modeling and find the commit they’re most comfortable with. And in case you’d rather just have the answer without any fiddling, we also calculate the best hourly commit based on your usage and appetite for spend. With this in front of you, suddenly answering “well what if we bought $X instead” takes seconds to answer instead of “let me get back to you after I rerun a bunch of reports.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SP Calc Demo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/490992216?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="399" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>RI Migrator</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/blog/aws-begins-sunsetting-ris-replaces-them-with-something-much-much-better/" target="_blank">As we wrote</a> when the announcement came out, Savings Plans are a total game changer for AWS customers, but the migration story from Reserved Instances to Savings Plans leaves a lot to be desired. The official (and horrible) recommendation from AWS is to let your RIs expire, wait a week for the Savings Plan Recommendation to populate, and then buy the recommended commit.</p>



<p>That’s pretty silly for a number of reasons. First off, that’s seven days of running compute at full on-demand price–for some of our customers, that could be hundreds of thousands of dollars in wasted money. Second, the necessary information to recommend a comparable Savings Plan replacement is already available to AWS, which just makes this laziness on their part.</p>



<p>Our RI Migrator solves this by looking at all of the RIs set to expire in the near future and calculates the exact Savings Plan hourly commit needed to replace it, allowing customers to purchase the correct Savings Plan the same day the RI expires. That way you’re not “double paying” and wasting discounts, but you’re also not paying on-demand prices. Take a look:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RI Migrator Demo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/490992219?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="399" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>We’re currently seeking beta customers to provide feedback on the existing DuckTools Apps and help us design the future ones. If that’s you, just enter your information on the form below and we’ll reach out with more details.</p>

While I was living there, I took over 10,000 photos, hours of video footage, and published an article about life in Antarctica on my blog every single day. &nbsp;Here’s a brief wrapup of my time in Antarctica, with links to all of the content I produced.</p>

      Conventional wisdom says that startup equity is worthless. While most startups fail, there’s a chance your equity will become a life-changing pot of money. This guide explains how to make the most of your equity. 
    </p>
   
</section></div><h3>Let’s start with an example.</h3><div><section>    <p>
Suppose you join a Series A startup as the fifteenth employee. A few months in, and you’re feeling incredibly optimistic. Customer demand is skyrocketing; you can’t seem to build quickly enough to meet their needs. The startup has added six new employees since you joined and is frantically recruiting more—you’re already a “senior employee!” </p>
   
    <p>
You’ve been offered the opportunity to “early exercise” all of the stock options you’ve been granted. This will cost you $40,000. 
</p>
    <p>
It sounds expensive (and it is!) but say that, two years from now, your company reaches a billion dollar valuation—it’ll then cost you upwards of $400,000 to exercise this same tranche of stock options and cover all of the tax obligations. 
</p>
    <p>
Silicon Valley is full of stories where startup employees miss out on material tax savings, on the order of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars, because they ignored their equity compensation until it was too late. This guide helps you strategically maximize your upside as an early startup employee at a fast-growing company.
</p>
   
</section></div></div><div><h3>Deciding to exercise</h3><div><section>


    <p>
      Exercising your stock options represents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment in your company. At a high level, here are the pros and cons of making such an investment: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pros</b>    </p>

      
      <p>With the 409A rising, you’re incentivized to exercise 
        <span>sooner rather than later.<label for="sn-srtl"></label></span>
        
        <span>Furthermore, your options do expire eventually, so you can’t put off exercising them indefinitely.</span>
        This will kickstart the long-term capital gains clock and break your 
        <span>golden handcuffs.<label for="sn-goldenh"></label></span>
        
        <span>The term golden handcuffs refers to compensation incentives that discourage you from leaving your company. While your equity may pose a large reward, if you cannot afford to exercise it, you’re monetarily encouraged to stay at your company until at least the IPO.</span>
        </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cons</b>    </p>

      <p>Investing capital into stock directly tied to your single source of income greatly increases your overall concentration in a risky, illiquid asset.</p>
     
      <p><b>To answer the question of whether or not you should exercise, consider the following: </b></p>
      
</section></div><h4>1. Your liquidity constraints<br></h4><div><section>
       <p>Your liquidity constraints will limit the number of options that you are able to exercise. To determine these constraints, audit your personal finances. Consider metrics such as your current liquidity, movable assets, near-term liabilities, and financial goals.</p>
       <p>Cash flow timing plays an important role, as startups often take 5-10 years to exit (if ever). Investing in your startup therefore comes with a significant opportunity cost: you could deploy this same capital into other opportunities (e.g., public stocks or real estate) that could generate steady, dependable returns over the course of those 5-10 years. You’re really looking to come up with a projected, probabilistic return on investment for exercising your stock options (and compare that to your broader financial picture).</p>

Your view of the company<br></h4><div><section>
        <p>In deciding how much of stock to purchase, you are essentially quantifying your level of optimism in your company. While you’re unlikely to have access to every line-item on your company’s income statement, you do likely have access to key figures (e.g., revenue trends) to inform your analysis. In the end, you need to form your personal investment thesis—Why will your company win? What will prevent you from succeeding? What’s the best case scenario?</p>
        <p>At the same time, keep in mind that even startups with the most seemingly promising trajectories can stumble. WeWork is an obvious example: in early 2019, it was valued at $47 billion and was filing for an IPO. By the end of the year, its valuation had dropped to $8 billion. Pebble went from a $740 million valuation in 2015 to $40 million by 2016. Juul went from $38 billion in 2018 to $12 billion in 2020. Employees who exercised their options at the higher valuations fell out of the money (and overpaid in taxes).</p>

</section></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val.png" loading="lazy" width="720" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 88vw, 53vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val.png 1440w" alt=""></p><h3>Deciding</h3><div><section> 
<p>
     To quantify this decision, let’s explore another example. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have 100,000 options, with a strike price of $1
      </li>
      <li>
        The current 409A valuation is $1.20
      </li>
      <li>
        The 409A in 3 years will be $20
      </li>
      <li>
        In 5 years, your company will IPO, and each share will be worth $100
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here are the various strategies you can try: 
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      
      <li>
       Early exercise everything now
      </li>
      <li>
       Exercise all options in 3 years
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait until the IPO to exercise
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The table below estimates the hypothetical costs of exercising now, in 3 years, and in 5 years.
    </p>
</section></div><p>You can scroll right on the table above →</p><div><section>    
<p>
Importantly, these projections assume a successful outcome for your company and don’t account for relevant factors such as dilution, timing, and liquidation preferences. Early exercising performs worse than doing nothing in the event your startup fails. Exercising your stock options is making an investment in your company. You are betting on its future performance and if it fails, you will lose your principal investment. Consults your financial and tax advisors to make the right decision.
</p>
   
</section></div><h3>Liquidity</h3><div><section>    <p>
Deciding when to exercise is also a matter of timing. How soon do you need liquidity? It’s often possible to sell some of your equity before your company goes public (or gets acquired).    </p>
   
</section></div><h4>Tender offers<br></h4><div><section>
    <p>
From time to time, your company may hold what’s called a tender offer. In a tender offer, some  cohort of shareholders are given the opportunity to sell their shares for a set price per share. Most companies irregularly hold tender offers (once every couple of years), and generally restrict them to current employees who’ve reached some level of tenure. Deciding whether or not to opt-in the tender offer has trade-offs—every share you sell is potentially worth more (or less) in the future.     </p>
</section></div><h4>Secondary markets<br></h4><div><section>
    <p>
A number of secondary markets make it possible to sell shares to independent investors. There are also funds and brokerages designed to help you get financing to exercise your options. It’s not guaranteed that you’ll be able to participate in either of these vehicles; it depends on factors such as transfer restrictions, timing, and demand from investors.
</p></section></div><h3>Conclusion</h3><div><section>
    <p>
No matter what, early-stage startups are inherently risky. You could end up with a life-changing pot of money in five years, or your equity could end up being worthless. Furthermore, along the way, funding rounds and 409A re-evaluations can occur and change your financial situation at any time without warning. In light of this risk and uncertainty, it’s crucial that you take an active role in managing your equity strategically from the start.</p></section></div><div><p>This material presented on Compound’s Resources blog is for informational purposes only and<br>should not be construed as legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

<p>Two very significant developments happened in Crypto this week: Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-files-for-ipo">filed</a> in preparation for an IPO, and the US FinCEN released a new <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf">proposal</a> effectively mandating KYC for unhosted wallets. Together, we believe these developments would have profound implications for the crypto space. </p>



<p>While Coinbase has always had high standards to list coins on its platform, as a public company, such a key revenue-generating activity for the company could see meaningful changes. The “Coinbase pump” could get a totally new meaning in the Crypto space – the extreme scenario could be that the “pure crypto” world – coins and teams that uphold privacy and censorship resistance as the key values that blockchains stand for – could move away from the Coinbase world altogether. The scenario at the other extreme, where most coins do what it takes to move over to the “official” side – also accelerated by Wall Street’s expectations on a newly public Coinbase – forcing the other coins fade into irrelevance – is also possible. </p>



<p>The other significant development is FinCEN’s proposal – that transactions from regulated exchanges to individual wallets not subject to regulation (as well as unregulated foreign exchanges) should be subject to an existing automatic reporting requirement – Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) for cash transactions (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/">Source</a>), </p>



<p>In summary, the proposed rules would</p>



<ol><li>“Require banks and money service businesses (‘MSBs’) to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers” who make crypto transactions into unhosted (read: private) wallets.</li><li>Require that “convertible virtual currency” and “legal tender digital assets” be classified as “monetary instruments” and are therefore subject to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).</li><li>Require that any transaction(s) totaling more than $10,000 in a 24-hour period  be reported to FinCEN, a bureau of the US Treasury Department, and that customer’s identity must be verified; many transactions would require a lower threshold of $3,000. Know-your-customer (KYC) rules, then, apply to even private crypto wallets.</li></ol>



<p><a href="https://decrypt.co/52021/us-treasury-apply-bank-secrecy-act-rules-crypto-wallets">Source</a></p>



<p>These two developments, along with Facebook’s Diem could very well end up defining a “new Crypto” – at least for the US –  a new asset class that is completely regulated, that <em>looks</em> like the “old Crypto” – but does not <em>feel</em> like it. But the new Crypto could be a fun new world  – enabling a new generation that would clearly see digital assets as a category of things to own, along with physical and financial assets, and decentralized in the sense that it is not owned or operated by one party – and censorship resistance and privacy could become concepts that might just need to wait a lot longer. </p>



<p>As we enter this new era in Crypto, it would be helpful to remember this: A list of wallets with names and addresses, with Bitcoin balances that add up to 21 million, is probably not what Satoshi had in mind when he/she/they hit publish on that white paper in 2008. That said, a promising new era beckons the space, and crypto being crypto, it will be exciting!</p>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

	<p>
		<em>How do you design good abstractions? By using abstractions that already exist.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was a boy, I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck">cassette tape player</a>. It came with playback controls like these:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/playback-controls.png" alt="Rewind, play/pause, and fast forward symbols.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Soon after cassette players had become widely adopted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder">VCR</a> manufacturers figured out that they could reuse those symbols to make their machines easier to use. Everyone could play a video tape, but 'no one' could 'program' them, because, while playback controls were already universally understood by consumers, each VCR came with its own proprietary interface for 'programming'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then came <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_player">CD players</a>. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		MP3 players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		Streaming audio and video players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you download an app that plays music, odds are that you'll find it easy to get started playing music. One reason is that all playback apps seem to have the same common set of controls. It's an abstraction that you already know.
	</p>

		Understanding source code <a href="#b07a5341dd654a529ea45517c4e80aff" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		As I explain in my <a href="https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-1/show">Humane Code</a> video, you can't program without abstractions. To summarise, in <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">the words of Robert C. Martin</a>
		</p><blockquote>
			"Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential"
		</blockquote><p>
		With such abstractions, source code becomes easier to understand. Like everything else, there's no silver bullet, but good coding abstractions can save you much grief, and make it easier to understand big and complex code bases.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only can a good abstraction shield you from having to understand all the details in a big system, but if you're familiar with the abstraction, you may be able to quickly get up to speed.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the above definition is great for identifying a good abstraction, it doesn't tell you how to create one.
	</p>
	<h3 id="d0a8ec8fa11e4455bbed098d9a61c24c">
		Design patterns <a href="#d0a8ec8fa11e4455bbed098d9a61c24c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://amzn.to/XBYukB">Design Patterns</a> explains that a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. As I interpret the original intent of the Gang of Four, the book was an attempt to collect and abstract solutions that were repeatedly observed 'in the wild'. The design patterns in the book are <em>descriptive</em>, not prescriptive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are useful in two ways:
		</p><ul>
			<li>They offer solutions</li>
			<li>They form a vocabulary</li>
		</ul><p>
		In my opinion, however, people often overlook the second advantage. Programmers are often eager to find <em>solutions</em>. "I have a problem; what's the solution? Oh, here's a design pattern that fits!"
	</p>
	<p>
		I have no problems with ready-made solutions, but I think that the other advantage may be even bigger. When you're looking at unfamiliar source code, you struggle to understand how it's structured, and what it does. If, hypothetically, you discover that pieces of that unfamiliar source code follows a design pattern that you know, then understanding the code becomes much easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two criteria for this to happen:
		</p><ul>
			<li>The reader (you) must already know the pattern</li>
			<li>The original author (also you?) must have implemented the pattern without any surprising deviations</li>
		</ul><p>
		As a programmer (code author), you can help readers (users) of your code. Don't use every design pattern in the book, but when you use one, make it as obvious to the reader as you can: Use the terminology, class names, and so on from the book. Add comments where your naming deviates. Add links that the novice user can follow to learn more.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3f4cb22e7a8642cd9938c89b22c098bf">
		Ambiguous specification <a href="#3f4cb22e7a8642cd9938c89b22c098bf" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Programming to a well-known abstraction is a force multiplier, but it does require that those two conditions are satisfied: prior knowledge, and correct implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know how to solve the <em>prior knowledge</em> requirement, other than to tell you to study. I do, however, think that it's possible to formalise some of the known design patterns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most design patterns are described in some depth. They come with sections on motivation, when to use and not to use, diagrams, and example code. Furthermore, they also come with an overview of <em>variations</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Picture this: as a reader, you've just identified that the code you're looking at is an implementation of a design pattern. Then you realise that it isn't structured like you'd expect, or that its behaviour surprises you. Was the author incompetent, after all?
	</p>
	<p>
		While you're inclined to believe the worst about your fellow (wo)man, you look up the original pattern, and there it is: the author is using a variation of the pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are ambiguous.
	</p>
	<h3 id="a90284d241c4463583401504395a4a8a">
		Universal abstractions <a href="#a90284d241c4463583401504395a4a8a" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Design Patterns</em> was a great effort in 1994, and I've personally benefited from it. The catalogue was an attempt to discover good abstractions.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's a good abstraction? As already quoted, it's a model that amplifies the essentials, etcetera. I think a good abstraction should also be <em>intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's the most intuitive abstractions ever?
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stay with me, please. If you're a normal reader of my blog, you're most likely an 'industry programmer' or <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/12/18/RangersandZookeepers">enterprise developer</a>. You're not interested in mathematics. Perhaps mathematics even turns you off, and at the very least, you never had use for mathematics in programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may not find <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology">differential topology</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus">stochastic calculus</a>, intuitive, but that's not the kind of mathematics I have in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basic arithmetic is intuitive. You know: <em>1 + 3 = 4</em>, or <em>3 * 4 = 12</em>. In fact, it's <em>so intuitive</em> that you can't formally prove it -without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axioms</a>, that is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">These axioms</a> are unprovable; you must take them at face value, but you'll readily do that because they're <em>so intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics is a big structure, but it's all based on intuitive axioms. Mathematics is intuitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writers before me have celebrated the power of mathematical abstraction in programming. For instance, in <a href="http://amzn.to/WBCwx7">Domain-Driven Design</a> Eric Evans discusses how <em>Closure of Operations</em> leads to object models reminiscent of arithmetic. If you can design <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a> in such a way that you can somehow 'add' them together, you have an intuitive and powerful abstraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that there's more than one way to combine numbers. You can add them together, but you can also multiply them. Could there be a common abstraction for that? What about objects that can somehow be combined, even if they aren't 'number-like'? The generalisation of such operations is a branch of mathematics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, and it has turned out to be productive when applied to functional programming. <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> is the most prominent example.
	</p>
	<p>
		By an interesting coincidence, the 'things' in category theory are called <em>objects</em>, and while they aren't objects in the sense that we think of in object-oriented design, there <em>is</em> some equivalence. Category theory concerns itself with how objects map to other objects. A functional programmer would interpret such <em>morphisms</em> as functions, but in a sense, you can also think of them as well-defined behaviour that's associated with data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The objects of category theory are universal abstractions. Some of them, it turns out, coincide with known design patterns. The difference is, however, that category theory concepts are governed by specific laws. In order to be a functor, for example, an object must obey certain simple and intuitive laws. This makes the category theory concepts more specific, and less ambiguous, than design patterns.

		I believe that learning about these universal abstractions is the next step in software design. If you know design patterns, you have a vocabulary, but the details are still open to interpretation. If you know category theory, you have a better vocabulary. Just like design patterns, you have to learn these things, but once you've learned them, you've learned something that transcends a particular software library, a particular framework, a particular programming language. Learning about functors, monoids, and so on, is a good investment, because these concepts are rooted in mathematics, not any particular technology.

<p><span>When you run into a problem, a bug in your code, how do you try to fix it?</span></p>



<p><span>Do you try to debug the problem, in order to figure out what the root cause is? Do you use tools like debuggers, loggers or code inspections, in order to better understand where and what is causing the problem, and then carefully analyze the best way to fix it?</span></p>



<p><span>Or do you make random changes to random parts of your code, see if that fixes anything, and repeat the above loop over and over again until things start working?</span></p>



<p><span>I like to call the latter approach </span><i>“</i><i><span>Evolutionary Programming</span></i><span>“. Comparing this style of programming to evolution is probably giving it too much credit, but it’s actually a pretty apt analogy. Evolution, through random mutation and natural selection, is the polar opposite of </span><a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design" target="_blank">Intelligent Design</a><span>. Evolution has no sense of analysis, design or intelligence. It simply mutates random portions of your code (DNA), keeps the changes that “made things better,” discards the rest, and keeps looping through this forever until it gets to something successful.</span></p>



<p><span>Such an evolutionary approach is already being used in specific subdomains, such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning</a><span> and AI development. Maybe one day, someone will figure out how to make the evolutionary approach work in mainstream Java programming as well. However, that day is certainly not today. If you’re a programmer and your personal approach to fixing bugs is to rely on the Evolutionary Method, don’t. You’re doing something very very wrong.</span></p>



<p><i><span>“But evolution works”</span></i><span> you may argue. </span><i><span>“If it can produce something as complex as human beings, why not use that same method in my daily programming?”</span></i><span> Well, consider this:</span></p>



<ul><li>It took evolution a billion years to accomplish what software developers were able to accomplish in decades. That’s a 10000000x difference in development velocity.</li><li><span>The end-product of evolution is something so complex, that no human mind can understand it. Consider the </span>millennia<span> that men have spent studying biology &amp; medicine, and we’ve only just started to scratch the surface in the past century.</span></li><li><span>The systems produced by evolution are so interconnected and tightly coupled, that it’s impossible to fix one problem with introducing 100 others. If you need proof of this, look at the list of side-effects that accompany any medical drug.</span></li></ul>



<p><span>I bring up this topic, because I just witnessed it first hand during an interview with an undoubtedly bright candidate. After 40 minutes of building a complex data-structure, it came time to test his creation. He knocked a few easy bugs out of the way in the first few iterations, but hit a brick wall on a more complicated bug. </span></p>



<p><span>Instead of digging deeper into the code in order to understand what it was doing, or using the debug tools in order to narrow down the specific code-block which was showing buggy behavior, he decided to fork off an evolutionary branch. He started mutating random parts of his code, and rerunning, just to see if that somehow fixed things. After 15 minutes without any progress whatsoever, he gave up and was even more confused than when he started.</span></p>



<p><span>A short while later, when trying to debug his code myself, I realized that he actually had a typo in his test-input. Turns out his code was right all along. But by focusing all his efforts on fixing a non-existent bug, instead of trying to understand the real cause of the error, he ended up getting further and further away from the solution with each step.</span></p>



<p><span>If you’re somebody with no aptitude whatsoever for analyzing systems, the evolutionary approach might be your best remaining option. But if your intellectual capacity is indeed lacking so significantly, you really should reconsider your career choice. A different profession, such as politics, might be more up your alley. Maybe one day, someone will build an AI that is capable of developing software using an evolutionary approach. Such a system may actually be successful, because computers can be massively scaled out and parallelized. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of your labor.</span></p>



<p><span>The next time you hit a problem, don’t just make random changes until something somehow starts working. Such an approach may work in the ultra-short-term, but it’s only going to produce spaghetti code that no one else will be able to understand, reuse or improve upon. You’re not a force of nature, nor are you a robot. Leave evolution to the science textbooks and start practicing some intelligent design.</span></p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>

<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this post, we’ll see how we can flatten a list in 5 different ways. Each method has pros and cons, and varied performance. By the end of this tutorial, I hope you’ll be able to identify the most appropriate solution for your problem. The Python version used in this tutorial was 3.8 and for the tests I used <code>pytest</code>.</p>
<h2 id="flattening-a-list-with-lists-or-generators-comprehension">Flattening a List With Lists or Generators Comprehension</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that we have a simple list of lists like this <code>[[1, 3], [2, 5], [1]]</code> and we want to flatten it. In other words, we want to make it like this <code>[1, 3, 2, 5, 1]</code>. The first way of doing that is through list/generator comprehensions. For those already familiar with them, this may sound very straightforward. What we need to do is iterate through each sub-list, then iterate over each one of them producing a single element each time. </p>
<p>The following function accepts a list as an argument and returns a generator. The reason for that is to avoid building a whole list in memory. With generators we can produce the elements on demand. </p>
<p>To make sure everything works as expected, we can assert the behavior with the <code>test_flatten</code> unit test.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_gen_comp</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using generators comprehensions."""</span>
    <span>return</span> (item
            <span>for</span> sublist <span>in</span> lst
            <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> sublist)


<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], [<span>1</span>]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_gen_comp(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the test we can see it passing...</p>
<pre><code>============================= test session starts ==============================

flatten.py::test_flatten PASSED                                          [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.01s ===============================

Process finished with exit code 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="flattening-a-list-with-sum">Flattening a List With <code>sum</code></h2>
<p>The second strategy is a bit unconventional and, truth to be told, very "magical". It turns out, we can use the function <code>sum</code> to flatten a list. Doing that is quite simple and concise, we pass the list as an argument along an empty list. The following function illustrates that.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about this approach, I discuss it in more detail in the <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of#can-you-flat-this-list">5 Hidden Python Features You Probably Never Heard Of</a> post.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_sum</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using sum."""</span>
    <span>return</span> sum(lst, [])


<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], [<span>1</span>]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_sum(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>And the tests pass too...</p>
<pre><code>flatten.py::test_flatten PASSED
</code></pre>
<p>Even though it seems clever, it's not a good idea to use it in production IMHO. As we'll see later, this is the worst way to flatten a list in terms of performance.</p>

<p>The third alternative is to use the <code>chain</code> function from the <code>itertools</code> module. In a nutshell, <code>chain</code> creates a single iterator from a sequence of other iterables. This function is a perfect match for our use case.</p>
<p>Equivalent implementation of <code>chain</code> taken from the  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain">official docs</a> looks like this.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> itertools


<span><span>def</span> <span>chain</span>(<span>*iterables</span>):</span>
    
    <span>for</span> it <span>in</span> iterables:
        <span>for</span> element <span>in</span> it:
            <span>yield</span> element
</code></pre>
<p>We can then flatten the list like so:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_chain</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using chain."""</span>
    <span>return</span> itertools.chain(*lst)


<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], [<span>1</span>]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_chain(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>And the test pass...</p>
<pre><code>[OMITTED]
....
flatten.py::test_flatten PASSED   
...
[OMITTED]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="flattening-irregular-lists">Flattening Irregular Lists</h2>
<p>What happens if we have a list like this <code>[[1, 3], [2, 5], 1]</code> or this <code>[1, [2, 3], [[4]], [], [[[[[[[[[5]]]]]]]]]]</code>? Unfortunately, that ends up not so well if we try to apply any of those preceding approaches. In this section, we’ll see two unique solutions for that, one recursive and the other iterative.</p>
<h3 id="the-recursive-approach">The Recursive Approach</h3>
<p>Solving the flatting problem recursively means iterating over each item and deciding if the element is already flattened or not. If so, we return it, otherwise we can call <code>flatten_recursive</code> on it. But better than words is code, so let’s see some code.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_recursive</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using recursion."""</span>
    <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> lst:
        <span>if</span> isinstance(item, list):
            <span>yield</span> <span>from</span> flatten_recursive(item)
        <span>else</span>:
            <span>yield</span> item

<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten_recursive</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], <span>1</span>]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_recursive(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Bare in mind that the if <code>isinstance(item, list)</code> means it only works with lists.</p>
<h3 id="the-iterative-approach">The Iterative Approach</h3>
<p>The iterative approach is no doubt the most complex of all of them. In this approach, we’ll use a <code>deque</code> to flatten the irregular list. Quoting the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque">official docs</a>, “Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced “deck” and is short for “double-ended queue”). Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.” </p>
<p>In other words, we can use <code>deque</code> to simulate the stacking operation of the recursive solution.</p>
<p>To go that, we’ll start just like we did in the recursion case, we’ll iterate through each element and if the element is not a list, we’ll append to the left of the <code>deque</code>. The <code>appendleft</code> method append the element to the leftmost position of the <code>deque</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>from</span> collections <span>import</span> deque

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = deque()

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l.appendleft(<span>2</span>)

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
deque([<span>2</span>])

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l.appendleft(<span>7</span>)

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
deque([<span>7</span>, <span>2</span>])
</code></pre>
<p>If the element <strong>is</strong> a list, though, then we need to reverse it first to pass it to “extendleft” method, like this <code>my_deque.extendleft(reversed(item))</code>. Again, similar to a <code>list</code>, <code>extendleft</code> adds each item to the leftmost position of the <code>deque</code> in series. As a result, <code>deque</code> will add the elements in a reverse order. That’s exactly why we need to reverse the sub-list before extending left. To make things clearer, let’s see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = deque()

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l.extendleft([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>])

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
deque([<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>1</span>])
</code></pre>
<p>The final step is to iterate over the <code>deque</code> removing the leftmost element and yielding it if it’s not a list. If the element is a list, then we need to extend it left. The full implement goes like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_deque</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using a deque."""</span>
    q = deque()
    <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> lst:
        <span>if</span> isinstance(item, list):
            q.extendleft(reversed(item))
        <span>else</span>:
            q.appendleft(item)
        <span>while</span> q:
            elem = q.popleft()
            <span>if</span> isinstance(elem, list):
                q.extendleft(reversed(elem))
            <span>else</span>:
                <span>yield</span> elem

<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten_super_irregular</span>():</span>
    l = [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>4</span>], [], [[[[[[[[[<span>5</span>]]]]]]]]]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_deque(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the test, it happily pass...</p>
<pre><code>============================= test session starts ==============================
...

flatten.py::test_flatten_super_irregular PASSED                          [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.01s ===============================
</code></pre>
<h2 id="comparing-performance">Comparing Performance</h2>
<p>As we’ve seen in the previous section, if our list is irregular we have little choice. But assuming that this is not a frequent use case, how these approaches compare in terms of performance?</p>
<p>In this last part, we’ll run a benchmark and compare which solutions perform best.</p>
<p>To do that, we can use the <code>timeit</code> module, we can invoke it in <code>IPython</code> by doing <code>%timeit [code_to_measure]</code>. The following list is the timings for each one of them. As we can see, <code>flatten_chain</code> is the fastest implementation of all. It flatted our list <code>lst</code> in <code>217 µs</code> avg. The slowest implementation is <code>flatten_sum</code>, taking around <code>30 ms</code> to flatten the same list.</p>
<p>PS: A special thanks to <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hynekcer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@hynekcer</a> who pointed out a bug in this benchmark. Since most of the functions return a generator, we need to consume all elements in order to get a better assessment. We can either iterate over the generator or create a list out of it.</p>
<h4 id="flatten-generator-comprehension">Flatten Generator Comprehension</h4>
<pre><code>In [1]: lst = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]] * 1_000

<br/>
December 18, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/15/how-my-twitter-hijacks-happened/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/15/how-my-twitter-hijacks-happened/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You might recall that my Twitter account was <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked</a> and then <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/03/twitter-lockout-again/" data-type="post" data-id="15287">again</a> just two weeks later.</p>



<h2>The first: brute-force</h2>



<p>The  first take-over was most likely a case of brute-forcing my weak password while not having 2FA enabled. I have no excuse for either of those lapses. I had convinced myself I had 2fa enabled which made me take a (too) lax attitude to my short 8-character password that was possible to remember. Clearly, 2fa was not enabled and then the only remaining wall against the evil world was that weak password.</p>



<h2>The second time</h2>



<p>After that first hijack, I immediately changed password to a strong many-character one and I made really sure I enabled 2fa with an authenticator app and I felt safe again. Yet it would only take seventeen days until I <em><strong>again</strong></em> was locked out from my account. This second time, I could see how <em>someone had managed to change the email address</em> associated with my account (displayed when I wanted to reset my password). With the password not working and the account not having the correct email address anymore, I could not reset the password, and my 2fa status had no effect. I was locked out. Again.</p>



<p>It felt related to the first case because I’ve had my Twitter account since May 2008. I had never lost it before and then suddenly after 12+ years, within a period of three weeks, it happens twice?</p>



<h2>Why and how</h2>



<p>How this happened was a complete mystery to me. The account was restored fairly swiftly but I learned nothing from that.</p>



<p>Then someone at Twitter contacted me. After they investigated what had happened and how, I had a chat with a responsible person there and he explained for me exactly how this went down.</p>



<p>Had Twitter been hacked? Is there a way to circumvent 2FA? Were my local computer or phone compromised? No, no and no.</p>



<p>Apparently, an agent at Twitter who were going through the backlog of issues, where my previous hijack issue was still present, accidentally changed the email on my account by mistake, probably confusing it with another account in another browser tab.</p>



<p><strong>There was no outside intruder, it was just a user error.</strong></p>



<p>Okay, the cynics will say, this is what he <em>told</em> me and there is no evidence to back it up. That’s right, I’m taking his words as truth here but I also think the description matches my observations. There’s just no way for me or any outsider to verify or fact-check this.</p>



<h2>A brighter future</h2>



<p>They seem to already have identified things to improve to reduce the risk of this happening again and Michael also mentioned a few other items on their agenda that should make hijacks harder to do and help them detect suspicious behavior earlier and faster going forward. I was also happy to provide my feedback on how I think they could’ve made my lost-account experience a little better.</p>



<p>I’m relieved that the second time at least wasn’t my fault and neither of my systems are breached  or hacked (as far as I know).</p>



<p>I’ve also now properly and thoroughly gone over all my accounts on practically all online services I use and made really sure that I have 2fa enabled on them. On some of them I’ve also changed my registered email address to one with 30 random letters to make it truly impossible for any outsider to guess what I use.</p>



<p>(I’m also positively surprised by this extra level of customer care Twitter showed for me and my case.)</p>



<h2>Am I a target?</h2>



<p>I don’t think I am. I think maybe my Twitter account could be interesting to scammers since I have almost 25K followers and I have a verified account. Me personally, I work primarily with open source and most of my works is already made public. I don’t deal in business secrets. I don’t think my personal stuff attracts attackers more than anyone else does.</p>

I’ve <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/09/12/the-backdoor-threat/">elaborated on that before</a>. Summary: I think it is terribly hard for someone to actually manage to do it. Not because of the security of my personal systems perhaps, but because of the entire setup and all processes, signings, reviews, testing and scanning that are involved.</p>



<p>So no. I don’t think my personal systems are a valued singled out target to attackers.</p>



<p>Now, back to work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We invest in products to be a better version of ourselves. The same goes for companies. If we compare today’s software design to those of the old days, there is a huge difference in UI and UX. Designers today are becoming more empathetic with designs that help users get things done more efficiently.</p>
<!--more--><p>New and better design approaches have arisen to fix challenges that designers or clients might be facing.</p>
<p>The term “design thinking” for example, isn’t just a buzzword. There’s a logical reason behind it. Design thinking is now known as a creative problem-solving approach designers use to create different new values and positive impact.</p>
<p>Now, how do we approach designing for B2B SaaS with design thinking? Here’s how.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Understanding Users: Boomers vs Millennials</h2>
<p>In comparison to startups and growing businesses, B2B companies, especially matured industrial and manufacturing companies, mostly consist of an ageing workforce. This is because older workers are much more likely to have a specific set of skills revolving around particular tools, plants and systems. Manufacturing companies hold on to them to avoid being faced with a skills gap dilemma. However, while having seniors in the game is important, as the world slowly submerges into new tech and advanced software, hiring the tech-savvy and digital natives is as important to survive and stay on top.</p>
<p>When designing an enterprise software, a firm needs to keep in mind the people who are going to be using their products. In this case, designers need to create experiences that feel familiar to older workers but are, at the same time, attractive to new users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the one hand, a software interface that is familiar to the older workforce will shorten their learning process and encourage them in their journey into new tech. On the other hand, old school tools can feel like a hindrance to the younger workforce. Millennials are accustomed to tools that can be accessed anywhere at any time, like mobile apps. Making software products that meet the needs of both sides can make working together an elevated and efficient process.</p>
<h2>Design Thinking for Productivity and Safety</h2>
<p>Unlike B2C products, B2B software is much more complex due to its multiple data states, visualization options, management operations, multiple-user collaborations and system integrations with existing softwares. All of these affect every design decision made to meet one another’s requirements.</p>
<p>When dealing with complexity, sometimes the best solution is simplicity.</p>
<p>Side by side with B2C apps, one may say that B2B apps look boring. The justification is that most industrial and manufacturing firms don't invest in design for the aesthetics — they invest in design to boost productivity while keeping safety as a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the best examples we have that focuses on productivity and safety is our project with Honeywell’s Building Management System (BMS) after they talked to us about exploring the possibilities of real time alerts on equipment downtime as well as tracking maintenance and team performance with a mobile app.</p>
<p>Industrial and manufacturing companies often come with mountains of data that they need to monitor, manage, maintain and use in managing equipment. When designing software for such purposes, cramming these large amounts of data on a single dashboard can cause distraction and overwhelm the user. The best approach is to build data visualizations that simplify and help users make quicker decisions with lighter cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Next Step for You</h2>

    <main id="main">
        <article>
            <!-- .post-header -->
            
            
            <p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/sunny-pic.jpeg" alt="How we use GitLive: A junior developer's perspective"></p>
            
            <div>
                <p>I’m Sunny, and I’m a junior developer at GitLive. Since we are making a tool by developers, for developers, I wanted to share how I use our own product on a day to day basis.</p>

<h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>
<p>As an annoying and (relatively) useless junior developer, I have a lot of questions. Since we work in a fully remote team, picking my moments is both important and hard to do. GitLive helps me a lot with this. It shows me when people are online and what they’re working on. So ideally, I wait till someone’s online, working on the same repository I’m working on and on a similar issue… and then I ask away.</p>

<table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <td>
                <img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/same-repo.jpeg">
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/slack-msg.jpg">
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 
            <p>
              Both working on the firebase repository. Bingo!
            </p>
           </td>
          <td> 
            <p>
              Look at that quick response time from Michael. 
            </p>
           </td>
        </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that in the future, messaging will be available within the GitLive window, so the context switching between instant messaging apps and code IDEs will also be eliminated.</p>

<h4 id="cherry-picking">Cherry Picking</h4>
<p>Sometimes I need uncommitted code from a teammate. With GitLive, I don’t even have to ask or disturb anyone. I just use our cherry-picking feature to see the changes they’ve made and take whatever I need.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/cherry-pick.jpg"></p><p>
      Thanks for this big chunk of code Fred.
    </p>

<h4 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h4>
<p>GitLive’s most useful feature for me, personally, is the collaborate feature. I’m trying to learn more about TypeScript. Pair programming with someone more experienced is a great way to do this. But pair programming remotely is a challenge… or at least it used to be. With GitLive, I can collaborate with one click, and no one has to begin a slack call and start screen sharing.</p>

<p>The convenience means that others don’t mind starting a quick collaboration session. It’s often easier than a long explanation, for both parties. In future releases, audio calls will be added to GitLive, so everything can be done within the IDE if necessary. Fred and Michael will soon be able to hear my lovely voice without even having to leave VS Code.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/baby-pic.jpeg"></p><p>
      How pair programming feels for the less experienced person.
    </p>

<h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4>
<p>Have you ever been so embarrassed by the code you’re writing to solve a problem that you don’t want your colleagues to see? Me too. Luckily GitLive has a setting for this, so I can hide my working copy changes just in case.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re working on something important and don’t want to be disturbed, you can appear offline, or hide your activity graph from view. I’m usually the one bothering people, not the one being bothered, so this is not a problem I have myself, but a useful feature for some of you nonetheless (maybe for you Michael).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/offline-mode.jpg"></p><p>
      I don't have a good caption for this one. Please enjoy this screenshot
    </p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>If you’re a tech lead reading this (ambitious I know – but one can dream) and you’re on the fence about whether to use GitLive, at least give it a try. From my experience, having a communication tool specific to developers makes the life of your team members (especially the juniors) much easier.</p>

December 18, 2020 | https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-released | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-released">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong>We are happy to announce the release of Qt Design Studio 2.0.</strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Qt Design Studio is a UI design and development tool that enables designers and developers to rapidly prototype and create beautiful experiences. Both designers and developers use Qt Design Studio and this makes collaboration between the two a lot simpler and more streamlined.</p>
<div data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true"><div><p data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9KBWcFXEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" xml="lang" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9KBWcFXEw?feature=oembed" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></p></div></div>

<p><span>To get an impression, you should watch this new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za9KBWcFXEw&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener">video created for Qt Design Studio 2.0</a>. </span><span>For detailed information about Qt Design Studio, visit the&nbsp;</span><u><a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtdesignstudio-4.14/index.html" rel="noopener">online documentation page</a></u><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For Qt Design Studio 2.0 we concentrated on improving the user experience. We made many improvements to the UI. Finally, it is possible to lock items to protect them against unintended changes. The navigator got many usability improvements, we added a rotation tool and many small issues got fixed. For more details please <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-beta-released" rel="noopener">refer to the beta blog post.</a></span></p>
<h3>Telemetry and Crashpad Support</h3>
<p>Qt Design Studio 2.0 comes with a crash reporter based on<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/doc/overview_design.md" rel="noopener"> Google Crashpad</a>.<br><span>Crashpad is a mechanism for capturing, storing, and transmitting postmortem crash reports from an application to an upstream collection server.&nbsp;</span> We use <a href="https://sentry.io/security/" rel="noopener">Sentry </a>as the backend service.&nbsp;<br>By default, <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/doc/overview_design.md" rel="noopener">Crashpad </a>does not upload the generated crash reports, since it <span>captures arbitrary contents from the crashed Qt Design Studio process memory. Therefore the dump could contain confidential information like e.g. project names. Therefore we must ask for consent and Crashpad has to be explicitly enabled, to upload the generated crash reports. Users are also able to share the locally generated crash reports manually with the<a href="https://www.qt.io/qt-support/" rel="noopener"> Qt Support team</a>.<p>The rationale behind this is that it is an unfortunate truth that any large piece of complex software will contain bugs that will cause it to occasionally crash. &nbsp;Even in the absence of bugs, drivers and incompatibilities can cause Qt Design Studio to crash.</p></span></p>
<p><span>We think that collecting crashdumps automatically is the best solution to this problem.&nbsp; It relieves the burden of manual reporting from users while capturing the hardware and software state at the time of the crash.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-47-35-31-PM.png"></span></p>
<p>We kindly ask our users to enable Crashpad to help us to improve the quality and stability of Qt Design Studio.</p>
<p>With Qt Design Studio 2.0 we also ship the Telemetry Plugin that is already an optional part of Qt Creator installations. The Telemetry Plugin is disabled by default and has to be explicitly enabled by the user. The Telemetry Plugin will collect <span>pseudonymous information about your system and Qt Design Studio usage. No personal data, such as names, IP addresses, MAC addresses, or project and path names are collected. However, <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/quuid.html">QUuid</a>&nbsp;objects are used to identify data records that belong to a particular user.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-49-10-93-PM.png"></p>
<p><span>If you accept, all collected and transmitted data is fully transparent to you. You can change the settings for collecting and transmitting data at any time. By default, no data is collected and you have to select a telemetry mode for data collection to begin. For more details please refer to the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-telemetry.html" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.<br>The Telemetry Plugin is using the Open Source library <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kuserfeedback/html/index.html" rel="noopener">KUserFeedback</a>.<br></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the Telemetry Plugin is to learn more about how users use Qt Design Studio. We track the frequency and usage time of particular features within the application. By providing this data to us, the users help us to improve future versions of Qt Design Studio. We get a better understanding of how our users use the product and how important a particular feature is.<br>Therefore we kindly ask our users to also enable the Telemetry Plugin to help us to improve the quality of Qt Design Studio and to better understand our users.<br></span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-03-18-99-PM.png"></p>
<h3><span>Thumbnail Generation</span></h3>
<p><span>A really useful addition is the generation of thumbnails for custom components. This means that custom components have an icon that visually resembles the component and Qt Design Studio provides a tooltip with a full preview. This helps to find the correct component and makes it more convenient to get an overview of the project and its structure. This is especially useful for large projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Technical Preview of Qt Bridge for Figma</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-31-24-02-PM.png"></p>
<p><span>With Qt Design Studio 2.0 comes a technical preview of a Qt Bridge for <a href="https://www.figma.com/" rel="noopener">Figma</a>. Figma is an interface design application with an emphasis on team collaboration.</span><br><span>The Qt Bridge for Figma is delivered with Qt Design Studio as a developer plugin that you can install to the Desktop version of Figma.&nbsp; To install the plugin you have to open the Plugin Manager of Figma and press the plus button to "Create new Plugin". Then you have to choose the Manifest.json file that comes with Qt Design Studio. After installing the plugin it can be found under Plugin/Development/QtBridge for Figma. The Qt Bridge for Figma allows users to seamlessly import their designs to Qt Design Studio from Figma. The feature set of the Qt Bridge for Figma is very similar to the&nbsp; <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-sketch-using.html" rel="noopener">Qt Bridge for Sketch</a> and components are already supported. Qt Design Studio also supports<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-overview.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> import/export from other 2D and 3D graphical design tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-41-23-18-PM.png"></span></p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshots importing reasonable complex files from Figma to Qt Design Studio does already work. The latest documentation for the Qt Bridge for Figma can be found <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/figmaqtbridge.html" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>Please note that Qt Bridge for Figma exports everything to a single archive. Before importing the project into Qt Design Studio you have to manually extract the archive. Then the .metainfo file can be imported. Please refer to the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/studio-importing-2d.html" rel="noopener">documentation </a>for details on how to import 2D designs into Qt Design Studio.</p>
<h3>2D Effects Redesign</h3>

<p>With Qt Design Studio 2.0 we also changed the way 2D effects work in Qt Design Studio. The new way of how effects work is more aligned with the Qt Quick framework and also more intuitive.<span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png" width="300" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=150&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 150w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 300w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 450w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=600&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=750&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 750w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=900&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Effects are no longer Qt Quick Items and are not part of the item hierarchy. Instead, effects are children of the item they affect. This makes adding effects like blur, glow, or masks easier. Effects can now simply be dragged in from the Item Library and dropped on the target item.</span><br><span>Stacking effects in a single item is not supported. If a user wants to apply multiple effects it is required to stack multiple items with one effect applied to each item.</span><br></span></p>

<h3>Logic Helper</h3>
<div><p>To make it easier to perform certain operations without having to write code we added a few Logic Helpers to Qt Design Studio. Once you add the import you can see the elements in the Item Library. These items can only be dragged into the navigator because they are not visible items. The Logic Helpers make it easy to setup Bi-Directional Bindings, map numbers to strings with a defined precision.</p><p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png" width="450" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=225&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 225w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 450w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=675&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 675w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=900&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 900w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=1125&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 1125w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=1350&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p></div>
<p>In practice, this means that Qt Design Studio 2.0 now provides convenient building blocks that replace the occasional usage of JavaScript expressions for conditions or to properly convert numbers to strings. Instead of having to write JavaScript code in the binding editor the user can now simply use these building blocks.<br>The Logic Helpers also allow to define conditions without having to write JavaScript code and make it possible to map the range of e.g. a Timeline to a custom range of a gauge.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MCU support</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/undefined.jpeg"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-for-mcus-1.6-released" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs 1.6 is now available</a> and Qt Design Studio supports creating projects that are limited to the feature set of <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a>. If the user creates a <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a> project using the correct wizards, features that are not available for <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a>, will be also disabled in the UI. This includes many imports, everything related to Qt Quick 3D, but also many properties in the property editor will be disabled.<br>This makes it possible to fully leverage Qt Design Studio when developing projects for <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a>. We developed the UI for a washing machine that you can find <a href="https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qtdesign-studio/-/tree/master/playground/washingMachineUI" rel="noopener">here</a>. The purpose of this demo is to show how applications targeting <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs </a>can be devloped using Qt Design Studio. Our washing machine demo is also an example of an application that runs on <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a> but also works as expected with normat Qt. The demo is developed in the subset of QML and Qt Quick that is supported on all platforms.</p>
<h3>Experimental Qt 6 support</h3>
<p>Qt Design Studio 2.0 also comes with experimental support for <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6.0-released" rel="noopener">Qt 6</a>. While Qt Quick based projects developed with Qt Design Studio also work with Qt 6, there are a few differences on the Qt Quick 3D side.<br>Since the actual rendering and instantiation of components is done in an external process (qml2puppet), this process can be build with <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6.0-released" rel="noopener">Qt 6</a> for full compatibility.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) designates radio frequencies in the 30 to 300 MHz band as very high frequency (VHF), and those in the 300 MHz to 3 GHz band as ultra high frequency (UHF).</p>



<p>Early small satellite and CubeSat development often involved the use of amateur radio frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands due to the low costs and high accessibility <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2001.931726" target="_blank">for end users</a>.</p>



<p>The UHF and VHF bands were also chosen as the primary frequencies for telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;C) in CubeSats <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2009.5338683" target="_blank">for similar reasons</a>.</p>



<p>Now, many years after the launch of the first CubeSat, various antennas have been developed at different operational frequencies depending on the requirements and applications of the end users.</p>



<p>These include several models for satellites at various sizes <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijap/2017/4940656/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including picosats</a>.</p>



<p>Most currently active CubeSats communicate with ground stations on frequency bands that correspond to amateur (HAM radio) satellite frequencies or are specifically allocated for space communication.</p>



<p>HAM radio frequencies that are typically used fall in the ranges; 145.8 MHz – 146.0 MHz in the VHF band and 435.0 MHz – 438.0 MHz in the UHF band.</p>



<p>VHF and UHF bands are often duplexed in order to increase the overall bandwidth.</p>



<p>This functionality, along with the relative simplicity of obtaining a license, makes the low bitrate VHF and UHF <a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/2018_MIPRO_Link_budget_analysis_for_a_proposed_Cubesat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a popular choice for Cubesats [PDF]</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Satellite UHF and VHF equipment experiences from early CubeSat missions</h2>



<p>One of the main causes of unsuccessful Cubesat missions is an issue related to the communication system, typically due to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thinkmind.org/download.php?articleid=spacomm_2011_3_20_30059" target="_blank">the use of non space-qualified electronics [PDF]</a> in the transceiver.</p>



<p>These issues come in different forms. Here are three examples of early CubeSat missions (as described in this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/105639/963837070-MIT.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">2016 Master’s thesis [PDF]</a> by Stephen Joseph Shea, Jr.) that were affected by such communication system faults:</p>



<p><strong>AAU-1</strong> – launched to LEO by Aalburg University (AAU) in Denmark in 2003, AAU-1 carried a demonstration optical payload. The ground segment used an amateur radio design and the satellite transmitted Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) at 9.6 kbps at 437 MHz.</p>



<p>Issues with the radio contractors led to a change in radio system late in the process, when there was little time for extensive ground testing.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAU_CubeSat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/60/Aau-sat.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>The AAU-1 satellite (image credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAU_CubeSat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In-orbit it was very difficult to close the link with the satellite and it was not possible to establish a consistent enough connection to complete initial handshaking, which made the satellite appear unresponsive. The mission team was only able to achieve limited functionality.</p>



<p><strong>CAPE-1</strong> – The Cajun Advanced Picosatellite Experiment (CAPE-1) was a 1U CubeSat developed at the University of Louisiana and launched in 2007.</p>



<p>The system used Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) at a frequency of 437 MHz and the team spent a significant amount of time ensuring that their CC 1020 radio chip could operate effectively with a set of custom commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) amateur radio equipment for the ground station.</p>







<p>Unfortunately although the downlink functionality was thoroughly tested, issues with the ground segment receive capabilities were not solved prior to launch, and the satellite was not capable of receiving commands once in orbit.</p>



<p><strong>MicroMAS-1 </strong>– the Micro-Sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS-1) CubeSat was designed and built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Space Systems Lab (SSL) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL).</p>



<p>The system was a 3U CubeSat using the L-3 Cadet-U Radio with a 9.6 kbps FSK at 450 MHz uplink, and a 3 Mbps Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) at 468 MHz downlink.</p>







<p>Once in orbit the operations team was only able to successfully communicate with the satellite for three passes; on March 4, 5, and 9 of 2015.</p>



<p>Telemetry testing identified a failure in the transmit chain which was likely caused by a solar panel that had only partially deployed.</p>



<p>These three examples demonstrate the vital importance of a secure and stable satellite UHF or VHF connection to mission success. But you also need to ensure that the system purchased is the right option for your particular application.</p>

<h2>Understanding your requirements</h2>



<p>We recommend a simple four-step approach for the preliminary selection of any new piece of hardware or software for a satellite or other space system.</p>



<p>Note that this is just a basic guide based on what we’ve learned helping hundreds of buyers select products within our marketplace and get rapid responses from suppliers.</p>



<p>It is just meant to help engineers make an initial assessment and shouldn’t replace formalised systems engineering approaches such as the <a href="https://www.incose.org/incose-member-resources/working-groups/Application/space-systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INCOSE Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) CubeSat frameworks</a>.</p>



<ol><li>Specify your currently known mission parameters,</li><li>Record all currently known overall design specifications of the system,</li><li>Consider the range of technology that will be used in the satellite and in ancillary sub-systems, and</li><li>Take into account the key performance criteria of the kind of product you wish to procure.</li></ol>



<p>These criteria are explained in more detail below.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Mission parameters</h3>



<p>The first step is to fully understand the currently known mission parameters, including both the critical applications and desirable, but not necessarily essential, objectives.</p>



<p>Typically the more precise mission parameters will only be established later in the process – usually iterated upon in a number of loops by considering the “system of systems.”</p>



<p>But having an idea of what functions your selected technology is likely to need to perform, and on what schedule and duration, will make selecting the most suitable model mch easier.</p>



<p>Also consider the launch stresses, testing processes and regulatory compliance that the product will need to go through in order to make it into orbit, as well as any obsolescence procedures once the mission is complete.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Overall design specifications</h3>



<p>Next, keep to hand all currently known design information about the entire unit.</p>



<p>This can include the volume, weight, primary structural material and more basic things such as the location, storage and transport arrangements of the major components.</p>



<p>You will need to make sure that the new piece of technology you choose will be suitable for these parameters.</p>

<p>Once you are clear on exactly what tasks the new product will need to perform and the design characteristics of the satellite or other unit that it will work within, the next consideration is the full range of technology that will sit alongside the product to make sure that everything is compatible.</p>



<p>You may not yet know the entire range of accompanying technology (and you might need to first choose the product model you are interested in in order to make decisions on other components), but make sure you have access to all available technical specifications of sub-systems and structural components that are most likely to be used, as per the current mission plans.</p>



<p>It is important to understand how different sub-systems and components will interface with each other to create a high-performing satellite.</p>



<p>Balancing the available mass, power and volume budgets is also important, which can only be done with a clear plan of which components will be used.</p>



<p>Also consider how the product will work with the planned or existing ground segment to ensure effective data transfer and communication stability.</p>



<p>Now that you have a clear idea of what sort of product is needed for your mission, system, and existing platform setup, the next step is to compare the commercially-available products that meet these criteria according to the most relevant performance metrics.</p>

<h3>Key performance criteria</h3>



<p>To select the best satellite UHF/VHF transmitter or transceiver for your specific mission or service, the following criteria can be used to assess commercially available products:</p>



<p><strong>Transmit and receiver frequency</strong> – note that many product manufacturers will provide at least one frequency range, possibly others if the system can be used in multiple bands. Typically measured in MegaHertz (MHz).</p>



<p><strong>Data rate</strong> – typically measured in bits per second (bps) or kilobits per second (kbps).</p>



<p><strong>Noise figure</strong> – measures of degradation of signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the difference in decibels (dB) between the noise output of the actual receiver to the noise output of an “ideal” receiver. Noise figure is usually given in dB.</p>



<p><strong>Power</strong> – available RF power, measured in Watts (W) or decibel-milliwatts (dBm).</p>



<p><strong>Orbit</strong> – range and duration of each contact satellite ground station.</p>



<p><strong>Ground Station and satellite performance</strong> – e.g. Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An old airport customer of mine (whilst I worked for another company) used to pop someone next to a busy runway with a stopwatch strapped round their neck. The unfortunate person had to manually log the time aircrafts spent on the runway to measure the runway occupancy.</p><p>All very archaic. Even in those days.</p><p>The problem was solved by using a <b>Point-in-Polygon (PIP)</b> algorithm, taking data from their <b>A-SMGCS</b> System (Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System) - basically the radar in the control tower to see if the coordinates on a plane intercept a defined polygon (such as of the runways) represented an array of coordinates. This was then visualized in dashboards.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/Po43FRVmFf402WpFQ4Y9L/c97db53a2dd4f73c348fe4a2a2e7f107/geo-spatial-mapping-kafka.png" alt="geo-spatial-mapping-kafka"></p><p>Not only did that person not have to suffer in the British rain, but the same practice allowed us to answer thousands more questions than originally scoped. This included checking whether they were in compliance with the time gap between aircrafts as they landed, and detecting pilots-behaving-badly by missing the correct runway exit in order to get to the parking gate quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>I documented it at the time <a target="_blank" href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/it/airfield-analytics-spatial-mapping-made-plane-and-simple-with-splunk.html">here</a>.</p><p>The process wasn’t really scalable though. From a compute perspective (each report had to do huge computation on-the-fly with Splunk) as well as from an accessibility perspective (i.e. how could this data processing be made available to engineering teams and with a good developer experience?)</p><h2>Who doesn't need to do geospatial analysis?</h2><p>With the explosion in connected and IoT devices, there’s almost no organization today that doesn’t need to optimize business operating models or deliver real-time consumer applications with geospatial data.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4HUCQLNNFdN14ezEQtfhXR/ee0d1ae511223a7f5f7e733c6f4c406a/spatial-analisys-illustration_geo-mapping__1_.jpg" alt="Spatial analysis of geo data"></p><p>Many are adopting <b>Apache Kafka</b> to connect their applications; often in which location-based data is sitting there waiting to be stream-processed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with the airport use case, doing this sort of data analysis is easy on paper. But the challenge is how it can be applied at scale, without having to manage complex pipelines and where it can be brought to production with software governance and assurance.</p><h2>Where DataOps and Lenses SQL Engine comes in...</h2><p>The Lenses SQL Engine for Apache Kafka has helped data engineers do on-the-fly data analysis and data-processing on <b>Apache Kafka streams</b>.</p><p>It abstracts many of the complexities of stream processing. It will automatically run your workload on your existing infrastructure (such as Kubernetes) as well as integrating into your CI/CD practices. It then provides the monitoring, alerting and ability to troubleshoot the applications as they run in production.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, defining a PIP algorithm in SQL would be impossible you might assume.</p><h2>...Unless you use SQL User Defined Functions (UDFs)</h2><p>Implementing a Java interface, we can easily build a UDF to extend the Lenses SQL. This can apply the PIP algorithm to detect if the coordinates of a given event intersects with a polygon.</p><p>For this particular use case, I’ve built a UDF that takes three arguments. A latitude and longitude value as well as a JSON Array that defines the polygon that we wish to map to.</p><p>The JSON Array includes a key as a label and then an array of lat/long tuples. Such as this.</p><pre>{</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Runway_27L":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.465164,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.434132</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.464743,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.434099</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.464993,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.482352</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.464569,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.482352</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;]</pre><pre></pre><pre>}</pre><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4kxnP3KXUpMSnOBzwi4OnZ/660fbb9de2662bf8bf15c97ad4ba65c2/image.png" alt="Airfield and plane at gate for geo-spatial analysis"></p><p>Overall, a query may look like this:</p><p><code>SELECT&nbsp;lat,&nbsp;lon,&nbsp;spatialmap(lat,lon,&nbsp;"{'runway':[[51.465164,-0.434132],[51.464743,-0.434099],[51.464993,-0.482352],[51.464569,-0.482352]]}")&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;coordinates&nbsp;LIMIT&nbsp;100;</code></p><p>The function works both in <i>Snapshot</i> mode and <i>Streaming SQ</i>L mode for continuous stream processing to be served into another Kafka topic.&nbsp;</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>The algorithm is based on a nice research piece “Determining if a point lies on the interior of a polygon” <a target="_blank" href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonmesh/#insidepoly">published here</a>.</p><p>You can read the full section if you’re that way inclined but if we had to summarize it in a tweet I would write:&nbsp;</p><p>"Imagine if our point (the lat/long) has a line drawn to its right across the polygon.

<p>The European Commission has said it cannot disclose the prices paid for each coronavirus vaccine, citing commercial confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>Civil society groups, MEPs and health advocates <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-under-fire-for-lack-of-vaccine-transparency/">have been calling</a> for months for the Commission to reveal how much the EU is paying, arguing that deals involving taxpayer funds should have greater transparency. </p>
<p>The Commission signed deals with six producers and completed exploratory talks with a seventh on Thursday. Countries will place their orders individually for each vaccine.</p>
<p>According to the screenshot published by HLN, the EU is spending between €1.78 and $18 per coronavirus vaccine. The price per dose listed for each of the six vaccines was as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oxford/AstraZeneca: €1.78</li>
<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson, $8.50 </li>
<li>Sanofi/GSK: €7.56</li>
<li>BioNTech/Pfizer: €12 </li>
<li>CureVac: €10 </li>
<li>Moderna: $18 </li>
</ul>
<p>Belgium will purchase more than 33 million vaccines for a total of €279 million. </p>
<p>De Bleeker said that publication of the price breakdown was “a mistake on the part of the communications team,” according to HLN. </p>
<p>In reaction to questions by opposition MPs about the potential consequences of the violation of confidentiality, De Bleeker <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/12/17/prijzen-vaccins/" target="_blank">said</a> the blunder would not “endanger anything” concerning Belgium’s access to vaccines.</p>

<p>According to HLN, the European Commission said: “We will not comment on what happened in Belgium, but the prices of the vaccines are confidential.”</p>

	<p><i>December 18th 2020</i></p>

	<p>Building tiny projects in my free time is something that I love to do.</p>

	<p>My main goal is to test out ideas that I note down in my phone. Sometimes they work and I make a bit of money, but usually they don’t. Either way, it's a fun hobby.</p>

	<p>Recently I was lucky enough to sell a tiny website I'd built. Although the sale was small, the experience was great.</p>

	<p>The process of selling a website had always been a mystery to me. Therefore, in this post I'll tell you what it was like to sell a tiny project, and how I think anyone can.</p>

	<h3>🛠️ 1. Building a Project</h3>

	<p>Back in June, I built <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a>. It's a micro online store builder that lets you create a page to sell a single item on repeat.</p>

	<p>I hacked it together over two weeks, launched it, and wrote about the process. It was a basic MVP with nothing really fancy about it.</p>
	
	<p>To my surprise, a few hundred users created stores, and I even made a staggering £1.64 in revenue through the 1% cut I took on every sale.</p>

	<p>People were selling t-shirts, hats, poems; you name it. One guy even started a store to sell his soul. I saw some very interesting things.</p>

	<h3>👨‍💼 2. Meeting the Buyer</h3>

	<p>My online following is pretty small, but when I type up a blog post like this, people check out the projects I've built.</p>

	<p>One morning I received this email from such a person:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Tiny Projects,</p>
		<p>.. Anyway, it got me thinking about your One Item Store, and actually, I'm wondering if you have any interest in selling it.</p>
		<p>No pressure, but if you are open to it please let me know and I can make you an offer.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Part of me wanted to keep working on this project, but deep down I knew that I didn't have the drive. Besides, I was really interested to know what the offer was:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Buyer,</p>
		<p>I would definitely be open to offers if you were interested in taking it off my hands, especially as you've been following along Tiny Projects for a while.</p>
	</div>

	<p>A few hours later I got an offer.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Tiny Projects,</p>
		<p>Glad to hear you're open to the idea.  Would you consider <b>$4000</b> for it?</p>
	</div>

	<h3>⚔️ 3. Negotiating a Price</h3>

	<p>Was this a good price for a tiny project? How do you even value something like this?</p>

	<p>After doing some back of the envelope math, I sent back a counter-offer:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Buyer,</p>
		<p>.. With a bit of a polish up and some better store designs, One Item Store could have some potential. However, I'd personally be keen to sell and focus on other things. Would you consider <b>$7,500</b> for it?</p>
	</div>

	<p>We went back and forth with offers over the next few days:</p>

	<div>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> As for the price, how about <b>$4800</b>?</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> Would you be willing to meet me at <b>$6,500</b>?</p>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> The upper limit of my budget for this is <b>$5,000</b>.</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> If you met me at <b>$5,300</b> (£4,000), you have a deal.</p>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> Ok, you got a deal at <b>$5,300</b> :D</p>
	</div>

	<p>My price dropped, but I was happy and ready to cash out of the e-commerce world.</p> 

	<p>The buyer was also a talented developer &amp; really nice guy, with a good idea of how he wanted to integrate One Item Store into his <a href="https://initialcommit.com/" target="_blank">own website.</a></p>

	<h3>💸 4. Money For Code</h3>

	<p>How do you securely exchange code for cash?</p>

	<p>Although it would've been hilarious to do this transaction through a store on One Item Store, we decided instead to use an escrow service.</p>

	<p>It worked like this:

	</p><ul>
		<li>Buyer transfers $5,300 to the escrow service.</li>
		<li>I transfer the domain name, users, and Github repository to the buyer.</li>
		<li>Brief video call explaining the code.</li>
		<li>Buyer has 7 days to try everything out.</li>
		<li>Escrow service transfers $5,300 to me.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>That was it, the deal was done.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions</h3>

	<p>I'm aware that I wouldn't have sold this project if I didn't have a small audience.</p>

	<p>It's made me realise there's this really fun strategy for any developer trying to make money on the internet:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Build things you enjoy</li>
		<li>Write about the process</li>
		<li>Attract a small audience</li>
		<li>Attract opportunities (buyers, customers, job offers)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It's that simple. Code something for a few weeks, then type up how it went. Maybe publish it on your own blog like this.</p>

	<p>Five people will probably read it, and that's awesome. Next time it might be ten!</p>

	<p>Keep building lots of little things that pique your interest, talk about it, and great things will start happening.</p>

  <p><em>This is the story of how I prepared for a decade to graduate in 3 months.</em></p>
<p>In 2012, I dropped out of college, where I was studying computer science, after just one semester. I already knew how to program and I thought I’d never need a degree.</p>
<p>Over the years, I found myself complaining a lot about it. I saw many opportunities, especially abroad, that were out of reach because I didn’t have the required papers. I felt ready for graduate school but couldn’t get admitted. I had to work harder to prove myself to employers. Although I never noticed any serious gap in my knowledge, I felt that something was missing. I started to resent my decision.</p>
<p>In June 2020, I attended a virtual <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a> meetup. As usual, I complained about not having a degree. This is when I first heard about <strong><a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a></strong> (WGU). Apparently, their online programs had <a href="https://sive.rs/kimo">no speed limit</a> and students could graduate as quickly as they could pass all the exams. I was skeptical, so I did some research.</p>
<p>Here’s what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s accredited</strong>. Their programs are accredited by the <a href="https://www.nwccu.org/">Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)</a>, the same accreditation body used by the University of Washington (#24) and the University of Oregon (#94).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s self-paced</strong>. Their competency-based approach allows students to complete courses as quickly as they can show mastery of the material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s affordable</strong>. Their flat-rate tuition of $3,200 per 6-month term means that the faster you complete the degree, the more money you save.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed too good to be true. I immediately submitted my application.</p>
<p>The next day, I received a phone call from an enrollment counselor. They confirmed everything I had read and told me that although they didn’t officially accept foreign students (I’m Canadian), they would try to make an exception. After a dozen phone calls, transfer/translation/evaluation of transcripts, proof of English proficiency, and tuition payments, I was officially enrolled in their <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program</a>.</p>
<p>I now had the opportunity to apply everything I had learned from <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">Scott H. Young’s MIT Challenge</a>, in which he completed MIT’s 4-year CS curriculum in just 12 months. Of course, my achievement wouldn’t be as impressive, given WGU’s less rigorous program and my prior experience in the field. Indeed, I wrote my first program at 10, I had years of professional experience as a software developer, and I had even studied the subject in college. Still, I would get a real CS degree in just 3 months.</p>

<p>In this post, I will take you through my entire academic journey, describing when, where, and how I completed each of the 34 courses (120 credits) required for this degree. Note that credits awarded for the first 3 courses (9 credits), taken between 2009 and 2012, were excluded from the quoted 3 months and $5000 total. “How I Got a Computer Science Degree in 11 Years for More Than $5000” didn’t sound right.</p>
<p><em>When consulting the tables below, “CUs” stands for “Competency Units”, which is WGU’s time-agnostic equivalent to “Credit Hours”. “Effort” represents the total amount of time (in hours) invested in a given course, from initial research to final assessment.</em></p>
<h2 id="cégep-édouard-montpetit-2009-2012">Cégep Édouard-Montpetit (2009-2012)</h2>
<p>From 2009 to 2012, I studied IT at Cégep Édouard-Montpetit and graduated with a Diploma of College Studies, which is roughly equivalent to an Associate’s degree in the US. From there, a Bachelor’s degree typically requires an additional 3 years of study.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with the program, other than mandatory class attendance, was its focus on Microsoft technologies: Visual Studio, C#, <span>ASP.NET</span>, SQL Server, IIS, etc. I was a die-hard Linux user who wrote essays about the evil of proprietary software in high school. Despite my initial resistance, I ended up learning quite a bit. Who knew I would later fall in love with Windows Phone, build a bunch of apps for it (including its first Bitcoin wallet), work as a Xamarin developer, and even spend 3 years porting <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI</a> to Android and iOS (<a href="https://platform.uno/">Uno</a>).</p>
<p>Out of 39 courses, I only managed to transfer 2 courses' worth of credits (6 credits) to WGU. They wouldn’t transfer any IT course. They wouldn’t take my calculus course because it was over 5 years old. Unlike a US Associate’s degree, which would satisfy all of WGU’s general education requirements, my foreign degree wouldn’t. Also, the subject and level of some of the courses were lost in translation, after going through a translation agency (French → English) and an international credential evaluation service (Québec → USA). If I had a recent (less than 5 years old) Associate’s degree, I could have expected to receive 10 courses' worth of credits.</p>

<h2 id="concordia-university-2012">Concordia University (2012)</h2>
<p>In 2012, I studied computer science at Concordia University and dropped out after 1 semester.</p>
<p>On my first day, I attended 2 lectures. I quickly realized that a 2-hour commute to listen to someone slowly recite a PowerPoint wasn’t the best use of my time. Lectures might exist for good reasons, but I wasn’t sophisticated enough to appreciate them. Instead, I read the PowerPoints myself, at home, and used Wikipedia to fill in the gaps. I only set foot on campus 3 more times, to take the midterm and final exams. Although I passed all 4 courses, I felt very confused about this whole university thing, where you spend a lot of time learning very little. So, I dropped out and gave up my scholarship.</p>
<p>Out of 4 courses, I only managed to transfer 1 courses' worth of credits (3 credits) to WGU.</p>

<h2 id="spanstudycomspan-2020"><span>Study.com</span> (2020)</h2>
<p>In July 2020, as I was going through WGU’s admission process, I decided to get a head-start by taking some courses online for academic credits. At that point, I was still hoping to graduate in 12 months (2 terms of 6 months). I figured that the more credits I transferred, the more likely I would complete the program in 2 terms. I still had no idea that 1 term would be more than enough.</p>
<p>Thankfully, US students have access to a lot of affordable options when it comes to taking online courses for credits. These are just a few of the many websites that offer courses with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_on_Education">ACE</a> credits in the $25-$200 per course range:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://study.com/">Study.com</a> ($199/month + $70/course after 2 included courses)</li>
<li><a href="https://sophia.org/">Sophia Learning</a> ($79/month + $0/course)</li>
<li><a href="https://straighterline.com/">StraighterLine</a> ($99/month + $59/course)</li>
<li><a href="https://saylor.org/">Saylor Academy</a> ($0/month + $25/course)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose <a href="https://study.com/">Study.com</a> because they had the largest course catalog (180+) and the most comprehensive transfer agreements with WGU. Their College Acceleration Edition plan costs $199/month and includes 2 exams, on top of which you can add up to 3 additional exams per month for $70 each.</p>
<p>Their courses are not the best I’ve taken, but they get the job done. They’re split into bite-size units, each with animated lectures and mandatory quizzes. The number of quizzes can be overwhelming, and I recommend looking elsewhere if you already know the material and just want to take the final exam. Some courses have projects, and most courses have a proctored final exam. Proctoring is done using your computer’s webcam, but the footage is only reviewed 7-10 days later, which can be a problem if you need to transfer credits quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they limit students to 5 courses per month, which is where I stopped.</p>

<p>On July 29<sup>th</sup>, after reaching <span>Study.com</span>’s monthly 5-course limit, I started looking for alternatives. Luckily, <a href="https://sophia.org/">Sophia Learning</a> had made all their courses free until the end of July due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The quality of their courses is better than average, and you can even choose from multiple lecturers. Courses are broken down into logical units, each with a set of challenges (quizzes) and a milestone (unit exam). Each course ends with a final milestone which is non-proctored (no webcam) and open-book, making them almost too easy.</p>
<p>I managed to complete 3 courses before the promotion ended.</p>

<p>On September 1<sup>st</sup>, I finally started my first and only term at WGU, with 23 courses (83 credits) left to go.</p>
<p>By then, I had already passed 9 pre-assessments (practice exams), which unlike course material were already available before the start of the term. On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months.</p>
<p>It made me realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was much more productive and motivated without an arbitrary speed limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could probably graduate in a single term of 6 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each student at WGU gets assigned a program mentor, who supports them from their first day through graduation. I had a phone call with mine every week, in which we discussed my progress and planned the week ahead. She quickly adapted to my pace of study and made sure I never got stuck waiting for an answer or for the next set of courses to be approved. I never expected that this human point of contact would have such a positive impact on my experience at WGU. Course …</p></article></div>

<p>I feel blogging is making a comeback, why? Because people are starting to realize that they can carve their own brand and be content creators, rather than just sharing your thoughts among few Facebook friends.</p>
<p>And since not all of us are video creators, most people will be selecting blogging as their platform of choice.</p>
<p>I even started my own blog, this one, shifting from Medium, and I hope to have a new year resolution where I will post at least one blog post a week.</p>
<p>However, even if I feel blogging is about to have a come back, a place for bloggers to blog is limited more than ever.</p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress is currently the most popular blogging platform that you can self host or use their own free hosting solution.</p>
<p>WordPress is regularly updated, and the eco system is great, however there is limited number of quality themes that is free and focused on bloggers.</p>
<p>Even WordPress’s own free themes are more focused on business, photographers, restaurants etc.</p>
<p>I feel WordPress is more focused on running a CMS company, and blogging is a side niche that users can use their CMS to build a blog.</p>
<h2>Medium</h2>
<p>Medium was a great choice when it was initially released. It is still a great place to blog and you can find lot of eye balls on medium looking for your content. And not to mention Medium blogs have a better SEO if you want to please the Google bot.</p>
<p>However, medium has slowly become a walled garden and paywalls. Most of the content they promote on their homepage are from premium users or paywalled content.</p>
<p>Also medium has shifting priorities and directions, for example once issued domain names where you can have your own domain name for you medium blog for free.</p>
<p>Later they made you pay $80, to have a domain name. Now it seems that they have given up the ability to have your domain name, but medium has now started issuing subdomains instead.</p>
<p>This lack of direction makes it very unpredictable for a regular blogger, because you don’t know what will happen to your blog in another 6 months.</p>
<h2>Blogger</h2>
<p>Google has not made a meaningful update to its blogging platform for years.</p>
<p>It still has the same outdated editor, and the dashboard that blogger currently use has been there for several years without any update. </p>
<p>The third party theme eco system has been also dried up, and google doesn’t seem be to interested in releasing any new themes for the platform.</p>
<p>I believe if it’s not for the ad revenue they are getting from current blogger websites, they would have given up blogger long time ago.</p>
<h2><strong>Stati</strong>c site <strong>generators</strong> </h2>
<p>Static site generators have been there for several years, there are different static site generators using different technologies, some use markdown while some are using WordPress as a CMS but generate a static site that you can easily host.</p>
<p>However, static sites are extremely difficult for a regular blogger to host. You need to have a knowledge on some technology like ruby or node to setup your generator, and web designing to setup your site/blog.</p>
<p>Then you need to have knowledge on git or web hosting to host your static site.</p>
<p>That is too much for an average blogger, who just want to tell their ideas. It maybe cool to have a static site if you are a programmer or a web developer, but for an average blogger it’s just too much.</p>
<p>When are we going to have a free, modern easy to use platform focused only on blogging and nothing else, like the experience Blogger offered when it was initially released?</p>
<h2><strong>Upcoming</strong> platforms </h2>
<p>There are some several upcoming platforms that caught my eyes, including SubStack and Write.as</p>
<p>I’m bit confused about SubStack because they call the publications as newsletters instead of blogs. And is it going to focus on newsletters like MailChimp in the future? or focus on blogs like Medium?</p>
<p>And how are we going to know whether any of these platforms will follow what medium did to their uses or may lack a clear focus or direction?</p>
<h4>Updates</h4>
<p>I initially had a typo which said <strong>statistic site generator, </strong>which I now corrected to static site generators.</p>
<p>Since I’m typing these posts using my iPad I’m bound to make some mistakes. Even though I try to keep them as low as possible.</p>
<p>Also thank you very much for everyone who commented on HackerNews, I enjoyed reading every single comment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Recently I replaced my home router with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Raspberry Pi 4</a>. My main goal was to increase throughput through my VPN. While at it, I also migrated from <a href="https://openvpn.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenVPN</a> to <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WireGuard</a>, and read their whole technical <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">paper</a>. This post sums up my insights with repurposing a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Raspberry Pi</a> into a network device.</p><h2 id="why-having-a-home-router-in-the-first-place">Why having a home router in the first place?</h2><p>When you sign a contract with your internet service provider, besides the Internet service, you usually lease a router too. It is certified for the ISP network and gives you wired and wireless connectivity for all devices in your home. In most cases, you can’t get rid of this router, and most people don’t bother. I think differently, and I believe it’s important to talk about its security risks.</p><p>Routers provided by your ISP have several drawbacks like:</p><ul><li>Their hardware is often very low-end, with insufficient RAM and flash storage</li><li>As a consequence, their software is limited in functionality</li><li>Sometimes, such routers have hardware modifications from variants made for the consumer market, and frequently they have custom firmware explicitly made for your ISP</li><li>You, as a customer, have limited access to these devices. On the other hand, ISP often has remote access and full control over the equipment</li><li>In the past, security experts found <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/40-asus-rt-router-models-are-vulnerable-to-simple-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">several backdoors</a> allowing remote access to anyone who is motivated enough</li><li>Such routers usually don’t get firmware updates, or they get it very rarely and only for a limited time</li><li>As a consequence, if security experts find bugs in software libraries used in such routers, these bugs are never fixed</li><li>You use such routers daily for years. Usually, until your ISP gives you an updated model, which is rare</li></ul><p>For me, having a custom router connected behind the ISP router is a no-brainer. I like having things under control, and I also use non-standard services like VPN, which spans through my home and flat so that I can access my stuff everywhere I go.</p><h2 id="from-mikrotik-to-raspberry">From Mikrotik to Raspberry</h2><p>I tried different brands of routers over the years, but one brand stuck with me for a long time — Mikrotik. A friend of mine recommended one to me, and since then, I passed that advice to others, having my own experience now.</p><div>

It was already a considerable upgrade from having a router from my ISP. At that time, a typical ISP router, or cheap home router, had about 32 MB of RAM and 4 MB of storage. You almost couldn’t fit any decent software there; there was just no space.</p><p>We were using ADSL for connectivity. To hook up this new router into my network, I connected it to the LAN port of the ADSL modem as the only client. Also, I turned off DHCP, set up static IP address, and turned off all “smart” functions, effectively making the modem just a bridge passing data from my router to the ISP, forth and back.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>A home router connected behind an ISP router</figcaption></div><p>Each ISP router is different, but you should be able to set it up similarly. Also, try to look up for the DMZ option and set it to your home router IP address. That way, all data traffic is forwarded to your home router, and no special rules are applied. One last thing, if your ISP router has a WiFi, turn it off. You need to set up a WiFi on your home router, or a device behind it. Otherwise, all wireless traffic bypasses your home router, and that’s probably not what you want.</p><h3 id="openwrt">OpenWrt</h3><p>Mikrotik devices use <a href="https://mikrotik.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RouterOS</a> as their system. It gives users features found in much pricier network products. I especially love their WinBox app, which helps to manage my equipment through a simple-to-use UI. However, as I used it, I found several bugs, and some features I needed were missing. For example, RouterOS supports OpenVPN only through TCP, which adds overhead. Also, when my provider configured a DS-Lite IPv6 stack, RouterOS support was limited, and I had trouble accessing a native IPv6 network. Therefore, I decided to migrate to <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenWrt</a>, which is an open-source Linux distribution aimed at routers. Due to this, many features were just there, including OpenVPN on UDP, and proper DSLite support.</p><p>OpenWrt had many software packages available out of the box. If I missed a feature, I could (and did) prepare a package, and if I found a bug, I could (and did) report an issue and provide a patch. One day, however, Linux kernel dropped support for my flash storage. Suddenly, the latest OpenWrt versions didn’t work correctly with my router, and I was stuck with an old version of the system. It was a problem from a security standpoint, as well as from a usability standpoint; I couldn’t use the latest software anymore. Because this was my main router, I couldn’t experiment with it and prepare patches. Testing my changes was not possible. I kept running this old OpenWrt distribution on my router for over a year. During that time, I was looking for an alternative solution, which is powerful enough to increase my VPN performance, and which can run customizable firmware.</p><h3 id="finding-alternative-hardware">Finding alternative hardware</h3><p>In my other site, I use <a href="https://www.turris.cz/en/omnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Turris Omnia</a>, which uses a forked OpenWrt code. I thought about replacing my Omnia with a network developer board like <a href="http://macchiatobin.net/product/macchiatobin-double-shot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MACCHIATObin Double Shot</a> and replacing my Mikrotik with Omnia. Still, ultimately I abandoned the idea due to the higher price and lower availability of the MACCHIATObin board. From the practical point, I don’t need hardware capable of routing 10 Gbit/second if my ISP gives me only one Gigabit, but I must admit it would be cool. Later I shifted my focus to a hardware running <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pfSense</a> or <a href="https://opnsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OPNSense</a>. These distributions have minimal support for ARM-based boards, and finding x86 hardware with low power consumption, reasonable price, and decent performance is not that easy.</p><p>Then I remembered on my <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/odroid-c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Odroid C2</a>. It’s a developer board with a single Ethernet port and a bunch of USB2 ports. What’s important is that it can handle Ethernet through its RJ45 port at full speed of one Gigabit. If you’d like to use such a device as a router, you need to have at least two interfaces — one facing your ISP router (WAN) and one facing your devices (LAN). I was thinking of using this internal Ethernet port for LAN because the maximum speed on the local network is essential. However, for WAN, I needed much lower throughput because my Internet speed was only around 100 Mbit/second. I found some decent USB3 to Ethernet adapters for that purpose. Odroid C2 supports several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/amlogic/odroid-c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ArchLinux ARM</a>. Therefore, transforming it into a router is possible, and I would certainly do that if there weren’t a new revision of Raspberry Pi. The main problem with Odroid C2 is that its kernel is not mainline, and it’s rather old. Also, ArchLinux ARM, which I planned to use, is not explicitly designed for routers. This solution could work, but it would most likely take a significant time to set up.</p><p>Last weekend I was determined to go with the Odroid C2 path. But then I looked at my shiny Raspberry Pi 4, and I changed my mind. I own almost all revisions of Raspberry Pi, and I use them in my work IoT projects. That was also the reason why I bought the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous generations of RPi were not that useful for use as a router because their Ethernet interface was internally routed through a USB2 hub, effectively limiting the throughput to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/getting-gigabit-networking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">around 200 Mbit/second</a>. However, RPi4 can finally saturate a full Gigabit link because of its new I/O architecture. Also, it finally provides USB3 ports, which work great with my external USB-to-Ethernet adapter. The main advantage of RPi4 over Odroid C2 is the mainline kernel support. Therefore it’s easy to use close-to-latest Linux kernel. Due to its popularity, community support is also better. And, as a bonus, OpenWrt added support for it in their developer builds. Therefore, migration from my existing router to Raspberry Pi should be relatively painless. Let’s take a look at this process.</p><h2 id="turning-raspberry-pi-into-a-router">Turning Raspberry Pi into a router</h2><p>As I mentioned, I needed to have two Ethernet interfaces, and Raspberry gives me only one. I decided to use the internal Ethernet port for my local LAN and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for WAN. Of course, this assignment is not mandatory, and if you use a USB adapter for LAN instead, your setup should work too. In my case, the LAN port on RPi is connected to a 24-port Gigabit Ethernet switch to provide connectivity for more than one device. You can buy any cheap Gigabit Ethernet switch.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>Raspberry Pi 4 with a USB-to-Ethernet adapter</figcaption></div><p>Without going into much detail about how an Ethernet works, a router serves two purposes — it resolves an IP address into device MAC using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ARP</a> protocol, and it routes traffic into outside networks, like the Internet. When two of your devices want to communicate inside the same LAN network, their traffic won’t get through your router at all, only through the switch. Hence, if you buy a cheap Gigabit switch, you’ll get a decent network performance, and it doesn’t matter what kind of router you use.</p><p>Therefore, if you have some spare Raspberry Pi 3, it can still serve you well as a router, just hook up some switch behind it, and make sure your Internet link is slower than 200 Mbit/second. Otherwise, your speed is limited. Raspberry Pi 3 won’t handle more traffic because of the internal USB2 hub mentioned earlier. RPi4 is a better choice in that case. I don’t have exact stats, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">USB 3.0 throughput is 5 Gbit/s</a>, so I believe the latest RPi should have no problem saturating an outgoing link.</p><h3 id="openwrt-installation">OpenWrt installation</h3><p>The installation of the system was pretty straight-forward. I followed the <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official instructions</a>. Note that if you have Raspberry Pi 4, its support is not yet in stable OpenWrt builds, and you need to download the <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/bcm27xx/bcm2711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">latest development build</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>This time of the year is about wishes, so here are the things that would make life easier for developers working on systems running in AWS. I’m sure I’m not the first one to think about these and they cover only a small subset of all AWS services.</p> <h2 id="general">General</h2> <h3 id="tags-resource-based-policies-and-cloudformation-support-for-all-services">Tags, resource-based policies, and CloudFormation support for all services</h3> <p>Some things are supposed to work across all services in AWS. For example, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">using tags to define permissions</a> (also called Attribute-Based Access Control) is based on tagging resources and identities and defining policies to grant access based on matching values. If you read the documentation, it seems to be a great way for scalable permission management.</p> <p>It seems to be a feature of the AWS cloud that you can use tags. But it’s not, it’s a feature of <em>individual services</em>. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">reference documentation</a> shows the services and which ones support “Authorization based on tags” and which ones do not. The result is that you can only used tags for permissions in some cases but not in others.</p> <p>A similar problem is with the lack of universal support for resource-based policies. Again, some services support it, some don’t so you can’t depend on being able to define permissions on the resource-side without first checking that the services you plan to use support it.</p> <div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/aws-iam-deep-dive-identity-based-and-resource-based-policies/"> <img integrity="sha256-rui8GWEmKXio0umiMwra9DUflY2yH40NgdpAh9dfChM=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/4c64ce-dc53af48910f62ebfd684a1cbdb05782628d5280cfb2e83ddd9b9d20e7ea43ad.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> How to grant and deny access in an AWS account </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>Then there is CloudFormation. You can use it to automatically configure services in AWS. Except that it does not support all services, and it’s a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/aws-iot-sitewise-now-supports-aws-cloudformation/">constant</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/aws-code-artifact-supports-aws-cloudformation/">stream</a> of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/09/amazon-appflow-now-supports-aws-cloudformation/">announcements</a> that a new service or change becomes supported.</p> <p>All these things are supposed to be “AWS-wide” but in reality they are “service-specific” making it hard to reason about how to configure them and it’s a contant source of confusion. <strong>They should be supported in all services, from the start, with all updates immediately reflected on them</strong>.</p> <p> Learn the services needed to build a serverless HTTP-based API on AWS from our <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#aws_serverless-promo-popup">free email course</a>. </p> <h3 id="remove-discrepancies-between-services">Remove discrepancies between services</h3> <p>Many things work differently in different services that should be universal concepts in AWS. S3 bucket policies and KMS key policies both control who can do management operations on the resources, such as they can prevent deleting an S3 bucket or a KMS key. But root users are exempt from bucket policies, while if you lock yourself out with a key policy <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam">you need to contact support</a>. Why is there a difference?</p> <p>And this is not an isolated thing. Most resource-based policies are effective for management operations. But a policy attached to an IAM role can only influence who can assume it and not, for example, who can delete it. Is it because it’s called “trust policy”? But it’s a policy attached to a resource, which is pretty much what resource-based policies are. Still, it’s different. Is the policy attached to a Lambda function can control <code>lambda:DeleteFunction</code> or only <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>? I don’t know and I don’t see any other way of knowing this than trying it out.</p> <p>When the same thing works differently in different parts of AWS it makes it hard to know what is possible without extensive experimentation with every single service you intent to use. And that’s a frustrating experience. <strong>Concepts that seem AWS-wide should be supported the same way in all services.</strong></p> <h2 id="iam">IAM</h2> <h3 id="debug-requests">Debug requests</h3> <p>AWS provides a bunch of managed policies that allow an easy way assign permissions to users. If you want to allow only reading s3 buckets, you can add the <code>AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess</code>, and if you want to allow managing Lambda functions then the <code>AWSLambdaFullAccess</code>. This allows service-level access control without writing any kind of policies yourself.</p> <p>But if want anything more granular, it becomes exponentially more difficult.</p> <div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/granularity-levels-in-aws-iam-policies/"> <img integrity="sha256-pJCFyfAixqM98Py1wcMAvWAy7iCHVJhJ37n35koqetc=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/f1d3d2-93a26a29e79ebe197a8c93d463b436e91301ec9cc8911cea4f51a7a4ee333cc7.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> What are the controls available to fine-tune policies </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>IAM policies protect AWS APIs. When a request reaches an API, it first assembles a <em>request context</em> with all the data that is available at this moment. This includes the <em>Principal</em> (who is doing the request), the <em>Action</em> (what is being done) and the <em>Resource</em> (on what). Apart from these, IAM also collects a lot of <em>metadata</em>, such as the IP address of the connection, whether the keys used in the request are authenticated with an MFA device, the tags that are attached to the Principal and the Resource, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html">a lot more</a>.</p> <p>In an IAM policy, you add Conditions that check the values in the request context. For example, you can deny S3 bucket deletes without MFA authentication, restrict the IP address range to the company IP block, or only allow access to S3 objects that have a specific tag attached to them.</p> <p>This sounds great, but in practice it’s mostly reading the AWS documentations, trying out something, seeing it not working, then trying to fix it by reading the documentations again. It’s a frustrating experience.</p> <p>For example, the <code>aws:ResourceTag/&lt;key&gt;</code> is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-resourcetag">global condition key</a> that is present in all requests.</p> <blockquote> <p>Use this key to compare the tag key-value pair that you specify in the policy with the key-value pair that is attached to the resource.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since S3 objects can be tagged, it means that this contains the object tags? Nope, there is a separate key for that, the <code>s3:ExistingObjectTag/&lt;key&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Or when API Gateway calls a Lambda function, you can use the <code>aws:SourceArn</code> to give access to a <em>specific</em> API Gateway. Similarly, an SQS queue can allow a specific CloudWatch Event Rule via the same condition. Does that mean that an IAM role’s trust policy can limit the Lambda function that can use it? Nope.</p> <p>And when you encounter something that <em>should work</em> but isn’t, the only resource is the documentation AWS provides. There is zero visibility what is wrong with the policies that are misbehaving.</p> <p><strong>There should be a service to debug IAM requests</strong>. I’d love a “request recorder” that I could use to selectively record live requests and see all the metadata in the request context exactly how IAM sees them. This would remove the quesswork of what condition keys are available in the exact scenario I’m interested in.</p> <p>As an added benefit, it could also show the steps in the <a href="https://advancedweb.hu/aws-iam-deep-dive-how-the-policy-evaluation-logic-works/">policy evaluation logic</a>.</p><div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/aws-iam-deep-dive-how-the-policy-evaluation-logic-works/"> <img integrity="sha256-uQoGgjNo8O/v2CtWAqTL748s/gi9ypxG9rrpnQN1o5U=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/aaebca-70bccf043c1eaaca15a722f4d65148c09ca368a6e1ba534f62e9b137896cd882.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> How IAM decides whether or not to allow a request based on policies </p> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="allow-session-policies-for-assumed-sessions">Allow session policies for assumed sessions</h3> <p>The session policy is an additional security mechanism to control access. It’s a drop-capabilities style control, as the principal willingly put additional restrictions on itself.</p> <p>It is an optional parameter of the <code>assume-role</code> call:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws sts assume-role <span>\</span>
	<span>--role-arn</span> &lt;arn&gt; <span>\</span>
	<span>--role-session-name</span> <span>"test"</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>--policy</span> file://policy.json
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When the resulting role session makes a call, the session policy must also allow the operation, in addition to its identity policies.</p> <p>When is this useful? Let’s say you have a multi-tenant application, storing data for multiple customers in separate S3 buckets. The application handles all customers, so it needs access to all buckets. But when the program determines which customer is making the request, it can put a session policy to limit itself to a single customer bucket. If there is a bug later in the code, this session policy prevents compromising the other buckets.</p> <p>The problem is that it’s only supported for <code>assume-role</code> calls, so you can only use it when you assume a role. And this complicates its usage in common use-cases.</p> <p><strong>A session policy should be able to be applied to already assumed sessions</strong>, such as when a Lambda function is running. This way, it would be easy to put these additional safeguards without needing to reassume the execution role.</p> <p>Similarly, it would be great if IAM access keys could support session policies via the <code>get-session-token</code> call.</p> <h2 id="lambda">Lambda</h2> <h3 id="allow-restricting-an-iam-role-to-a-single-function">Allow restricting an IAM role to a single function</h3> <p>Currently, an IAM role’s trust policy can only define the <code>lambda.amazonaws.com</code> service but not the specific function. Since most execution roles are for a single function, <strong>it would be great if this could be enforced in the role itself</strong>.</p> <h3 id="separate-warmup-requests">Separate warmup requests</h3> <p>Cold starts, also called first requests, happen when the Lambda service needs to start a new instance of the function. When it happens, the request needs to wait the setup process when the service deploys the code to a new machine. Worse still, the request also needs to wait while the execution environment is set up and for any application-specific setup process. This makes it noticably longer than other requests.</p> <p>This cold start can easily be orders of magnitude slower than other requests. At one point I worked on an app that precompiled a bunch of JSON schemas during the first request. It took ~10 seconds, then all the later requests were between 50 - 100 ms. This code demonstrates this behavior:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>wait</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>time</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>time</span><span>));</span>
<span>const</span> <span>startup</span> <span>=</span> <span>wait</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>);</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello world</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>How the Lambda service works today is that the request waits until the cold start is finished. If there is 1 instance running and 2 requests comes at the same time one will take 50 ms and the other 10 seconds! If the second request is simply queued, it would be finished in 100 ms. As a result, there will always be some requests that take 10 seconds and that forces me to bring this down to an acceptable level even when I don’t expect spikes in traffic.</p> <p><strong>Lambda should do a warmup request when it needs to start a new instance and queue the requests to the already running instances and only start using the new environment when it’s properly warmed up.</strong></p> <h2 id="organizations">Organizations</h2> <h3 id="programmatically-delete-a-member-account">Programmatically delete a member account</h3> <p>Creating accounts via Organizations is easy to automate. It is just an API call and it also creates a role with Administrator access so that you can also script how to setup resources inside. Since separate accounts provide limits to the <em>blast radius</em> (the damage a security breach can do) it’s a good practice to use many of them.</p> <div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/why-a-multi-account-setup-is-essential-for-secure-systems/"> <img integrity="sha256-rziPMS92alOgcxbBMcTPLzCJI5o9jlsTy68QzOPUEio=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/9787c4-b05c9fc78c1eb47f4f5760b365b8a05cf25ada7799d820857c12edfc1eb053e5.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> Development and …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>NumPy <i>ndarray</i> objects can be indexed using Python <span>x[selection_obj]</span> syntax, where <i>x</i> is the array. There are three kinds of indexing available in numpy: <b>field access, basic slicing, advanced indexing</b>.</p>

<p>The Basic slicing in numpy extends Python's basic concept of slicing to N dimensions. It occurs when <i>selection_obj</i> is a slice object (constructed by <span>start:stop:step</span> notation), an integer, or a tuple of slice objects and integers. Ellipsis and newaxis objects can also be used.</p>

<h3>Example:using slice object</h3>
<p>In the below example, basic slice syntax <i>start:stop:step</i> is used to slice the given array <i>Arr</i>. Please note that in Python, all indices are <b>zero-based</b>.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from index=1,
#stopping at index=7 with step=2
SArr = Arr[1:7:2]
print("SArr contains:", SArr)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr contains: [1 3 5]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing object without start, stop and step</h3>
<p>The slice object can be constructed without specifying <i>start</i>, <i>end</i> or <i>step</i>. In such cases starting index of the array is considered as <i>start</i>, last index is considered as <i>stop</i>, and 1 is considered as <i>step</i>. Consider the below example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from start to index=7
SArr1 = Arr[:7]
print("SArr1 contains:", SArr1)

#slicing Arr starting from index=2 to last
SArr2 = Arr[2:]
print("SArr2 contains:", SArr2)

#slicing Arr starting from index=2 to last
#with step=2
SArr3 = Arr[2::2]
print("SArr3 contains:", SArr3)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr1 contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6]
SArr2 contains: [2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr3 contains: [2 4 6 8]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing object with negative index</h3>
<p>Python supports negative indexing and it starts with -1 in backward direction. Therefore, Negative value of <i>start</i> and <i>stop</i> can be interpreted as <i>n+start</i> and <i>n+stop</i> respectively, where <i>n</i> is the number of elements in the corresponding dimension. Consider the below example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from index=-5 to index=-1
SArr = Arr[-5:-1]
print("SArr contains:", SArr)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr contains: [5 6 7 8]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing array using slice function</h3>
<p>A slice object can also be constructed using Python in-built - <a href="https://www.alphacodingskills.com/python/notes/python-function-slice.php">slice function</a>. Consider the below example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from index=1 to 
#index=7 with step=2
s = slice(1,7,2)
SArr = Arr[s]
print("SArr contains:", SArr)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr contains: [1 3 5]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: selecting a single element</h3>
<p>A single element can be selected from the array by specifying its index number.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

print("Arr[2]:", Arr[2])
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Arr[2]: 2
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing a 2-D array</h3>
<p>In the below example, a 2-D array is sliced.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("Arr contains:\n", Arr)

#slice the array from index Arr[1:]
SArr1 = Arr[1:]
print("\nSArr1 contains:\n", SArr1)

#slice the array from index Arr[1:,1:]
SArr2 = Arr[1:,1:]
print("\nSArr2 contains:\n", SArr2)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

SArr1 contains:
 [[4 5 6]
  [7 8 9]]

SArr2 contains:
 [[5 6]
  [8 9]]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing a 2-D array using Ellipsis</h3>
<p>Slicing can also be done using ellipsis (…). Ellipsis expands to the number of <span>:</span> objects needed for the selection tuple to index all dimensions. In most cases, this means that length of the expanded selection tuple is x.ndim. Consider the following example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("Arr contains:\n", Arr)

#slice using :
SArr1 = Arr[:,1]
print("\nSArr1 contains:\n", SArr1)

#slice using ellipsis
SArr2 = Arr[...,1]
print("\nSArr2 contains:\n", SArr2)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

SArr1 contains:
 [2 5 8]

SArr2 contains:
 [2 5 8]
</pre>
</div>


<br>
<h3>Example: slicing a 2-D array using numpy.newaxis</h3>
<p>numpy.newaxis can also be used while slicing an array which expand the dimensions of the resulting selection by one unit-length dimension. numpy.newaxis is convenient alias for None. Consider the following example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("Arr contains:\n", Arr)

#slice using :
SArr1 = Arr[:,1]
print("\nSArr1 contains:\n", SArr1)

#slice using np.newaxis
SArr2 = Arr[np.newaxis,:,1]
print("\nSArr2 contains:\n", SArr2)

#slice using np.newaxis
SArr3 = Arr[:,np.newaxis,1]
print("\nSArr3 contains:\n", SArr3)

#slice using np.newaxis
SArr4 = Arr[:,1,np.newaxis]
print("\nSArr4 contains:\n", SArr4)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

SArr1 contains:
 [2 5 8]

SArr2 contains:
 [[2 5 8]]

SArr3 contains:
 [[2]
  [5]
  [8]]

SArr4 contains:
 [[2]
  [5]
  [8]]
</pre>
</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>What two people know is a secret. What ten people know is information.</em><br>(unknown)</p><p>I’ll go straight to the point: <strong>The Symfony app secret is critical for security.</strong> If it leaks, is cracked, or guessed, your application is compromised. If you have any suspicion it may have already leaked or be in danger of leaking, <a href="https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/#change-installation-parameters" title="">replace it with a new secret</a>, and check your installation for possible intrusion. Now.</p>
</div><div><p>Here’s a quick summary of our advice, before we dive into the details:</p><ul><li>Replace any default secrets (see below)</li><li>Replace any short (less than 32 characters) secrets</li><li>Replace any old (several years) secrets</li><li>Replace any secrets that may have been exposed (config file on GitHub, site in dev-mode without access controls, etc)</li></ul><p>The Symfony  <code>FragmentListener</code> is made for handling edge-side includes (ESI), and is designed to execute PHP code in response to certain requests. This of course makes it a target of interest for attackers, which is why we only accept requests that are cryptographically signed with a valid keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). To make a valid HMAC you need a key: The Symfony app secret.</p><p>This makes it crucial that this secret is indeed kept secret, to avoid any possibility of such code execution attacks. To illustrate how we can keep it secret, let’s look at how attackers can get hold of the secret.</p><p>The first, and easiest way is if the web site uses a default value. Ideally, software should not include any default secrets or passwords. Please note that while the current release of Ibexa DXP (v3.2) comes with a default secret, this is expected to end with v3.3 in December 2020. Until then, the solution is obviously to replace the default with your own secret. Here’s a list of current and older <strong>defaults you should never use:</strong></p><ul><li> <code>ff6dc61a329dc96652bb092ec58981f7</code></li><li> <code>ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt</code></li><li> <code>ThisEzPlatformTokenIsNotSoSecret_PleaseChangeIt</code></li></ul><p>The second way is brute forcing the secret. To do that, the attacker must have access to a valid hash, knowledge of how the hash is generated, and enough computing power. For the hash, any valid fragment request URL will do, and those are by necessity included in ordinary responses from the web server. CSRF tokens and remember-me-cookies can also be based on the app secret. The open-source nature of the kernel of Ibexa DXP/ eZ Platform means the <em>how</em> of hash generation is also given.</p><p>How much computing power you need depends on how long and how random the secret is, and this is why the whole matter of the app secret is not in itself a security vulnerability. A strong, well-kept secret is impossible to crack within a time useful to the attacker. If it takes 1000 years to crack, no-one will bother. But if your secret is the word “secret”, it won’t last long. In other words, the rules for a strong app secret are the same as for a strong password. And fortunately, you don’t have to memorize your secret, you save it as you set up your site. This means you can make it very long and very random. <a href="https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/#change-installation-parameters" title="">Our documentation now suggests a 64 characters-long secret</a> based on PHP’s cryptographically secure <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php" title="">pseudo-random generator  <code>random_bytes()</code></a>. <strong>Change your secret if it is shorter than 32 characters.</strong></p><p>Be aware that old versions of eZ Publish Platform would auto-generate a random secret that wasn’t secure enough. It depended on the current time when the secret was generated, which can be leaked by checking the creation dates of the oldest content in an installation. This can limit the time to crack the secret to mere hours. <strong>If your app secret is years old, we strongly recommend replacing it with a new one.</strong> It’s a good idea to do this regularly in any case, for instance at one- or two-year intervals.</p><p>The third way for an attacker to get hold of the secret is through vulnerabilities. If the secret is stored in your config files, make sure your web server blocks all external access to those, as it should in any case. If your code is hosted on a public code repository on e.g. GitHub, make sure you don’t store this critical configuration there. Even if your repository isn’t public, it’s risky to put secrets into it. Repositories are duplicated onto developer’s private machines, where they can be leaked in many ways. If your secret is stored in an environment variable as is common in Platform.sh, it can be leaked for instance by <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php" title="">phpinfo()</a>, which is exposed by the Symfony web debug toolbar when the site is running in dev mode. <strong>If your site is reachable on the public internet, either don’t use dev mode, or protect all access with a strong password.</strong></p><p>I hope this is all clear. Don’t hesitate to contact us in the comments, or <a href="https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/reporting_issues/" title="">through secure channels</a> if that is needed. Thanks for reading, and stay secure!</p>

                        <p>Yes, you can create unlimited free surveys, unlimited questions and full access to small talk and conditional logic functionalities. The limitations for free surveys are: up to 100 responses per survey, no option to add your logo, social media links, create Call to Actions, or export the responses.</p>

                        <p>You can pretty much create surveys in any language. We support RTL (right to left) formats and Karen has been translated to six languages so far. But even if your language is not available yet, the content of your survey is entirely created by you, so for your users, they'll see it fully in your language. In that case, only the dashboard that you would access to see the responses would be in English.</p>

                        <p>They are ways to make your survey more interactive and smart. Small talks are responses to your user's responses before the next question. For example, if the question is "Do you like icecream?" After the user says "Yes," you could want to say "Of course, who doesn't?" or if the user says "No," you could say "What??? I don't believe it." Before displaying the next question.</p>
                        <p>Conditional Logic will direct the user to a completely different set of questions based on their responses.</p>

Nearly half of all new applications built inside Amazon this year are <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/30/exclusive-aws-chief-andy-jassy-wakeup-call-cloud-adoption/">running on Lambda</a>. Andy Jassy took time in his re:Invent keynote to call out the thousands of enterprises who now run Lambda workloads in production, but perhaps most interesting was that this year the new serverless feature announcements graduated to Jassy’s keynote — a spot usually reserved for the flashiest, most strategic reveals of the year. AWS, at least, clearly believes that serverless is now one of the primary selling points for its cloud.</p><p>(On the other hand, there’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/adoption-of-aws-lambda-serverless-stalls/">this odd article</a>, which spends most of its length demonstrating FaaS growth, but ran under the headline “Serverless Adoption Stalls” because … Kubernetes teams say they aren’t using as much Lambda? In other news, cats report eating fewer vegetables.)</p><p>What’s not in debate is that Lambda, still the 900-pound gorilla of FaaS, looks a lot different today than when it went GA in 2015. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/">loud, weird niche of engineers</a> who bought into serverless early have always had <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1336765475615879181">very specific ideas</a> about what good serverless systems look like … and lately, Lambda’s been rattling their assumptions.</p><h2 id="h-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-serverless-manifesto">The Decline and Fall of The Serverless Manifesto</h2><p>Those original ideals of FaaS purity didn’t just materialize out of thin air. As recently as 2016, AWS serverless leadership was talking up something they called the Serverless Compute Manifesto. This was a radical vision for how Functions-as-a-Service should, uh, function. The manifesto showed up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOgc3MRUrs">all sorts of talks</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Serverlessconf/status/735839492431548418">at ACG’s ServerlessConf</a>. Here are its key tenets:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2016)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</em></li><li><em>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</em></li><li><em>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</em></li><li><em>Scales per request; Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</em></li><li><em>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</em></li><li><em>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</em></li></ul><p>This manifesto formed a shocking and highly countercultural blueprint for how to build and deploy software. It attracted a small but vibrant community of true believers and a somewhat larger and much louder set of skeptics.&nbsp;</p><p>But in retrospect, the serverless compute manifesto had trouble penetrating beyond that small, engaged nucleus. The bold vision just left out too many existing, legacy workloads and teams.</p><p>So, gradually, like the commandments in Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm, </em>AWS’s non-negotiables of serverless compute began to change. Let’s run through each point of the manifesto and see if Lambda still adheres to it.</p><p><strong>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling?</strong></p><p><em>Sorta, but not strictly. </em>You can deploy multi-function Lambda Layers to manage large binaries, or (now in preview) Lambda Extensions to plug in third-party agents that I’ve been told should definitely not be thought of as “sidecars for Lambda”.</p><p><strong>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>As of re:Invent 2020, Lambda <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">now allows you to bring your own containers</a> instead of just shipping a ZIP file of code.</p><p><strong>Permanent storage lives elsewhere?</strong></p><p><em>Not necessarily. </em>Lambda now integrates with EFS, which I guess is technically “elsewhere”, but no more so than any other NFS share attached to a server is “elsewhere”. It’s a persistent filesystem mounted to your compute.</p><p><strong>Scales per request?</strong></p><p><em>Yes!</em> Now that Lambda can run containers, I believe the request model is now the biggest remaining conceptual difference between Lambda and a managed container service like AWS Fargate. Lambda gives you a new execution environment per concurrent request, whereas a Fargate-like service will still process multiple concurrent requests on the same (long-lived) container.</p><p><strong>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>Meet Provisioned Capacity, which trades your cold start problem for a hot cost problem. (I snark, but Provisioned Capacity is way better than running your own Lambda pre-warming job, which a LOT of people used to do.)</p><p><strong>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true – </em>not if you use Provisioned Capacity or EFS, anyway.</p><p><strong>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere?</strong></p><p><em>Ehhhh. </em>This one is about abstracting away availability zones, which a lot of higher-level AWS services besides Lambda (including Fargate!) now do. That said, we’re starting to hear more guidance from AWS that really, the fault domain you need to be thinking about is regions. That’s right: regions are the new availability zones, and savvy Lambda developers are rolling their own (very un-managed) multi-region architectures as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>To reinforce the trend, let’s check in with two other defining early features of Lambda:</p><p><strong>Intentional time and space constraints?</strong></p><p><em>Less and less true</em>. Function disk sizes, runtime limits, and CPU and memory sizes have steadily increased over the last 5 years. Today you can run a Lambda function for 15 minutes with 10 GB of memory and 6 vCPUs – a hefty enough blob of compute to make you think seriously about multi-threading, multi-purpose functions, and other things that are against the old ideals of FaaS.</p><p><strong>Zero-trust networking?</strong></p><p><em>Only if you want it. </em>In the old days, Lambda architectures biased heavily toward IAM security rather than using VPCs, partly for ideological reasons but also because attaching functions to custom ENIs added tremendous cold start overhead. Today, innovation from AWS has made customer-managed VPCs much more compatible with Lambda.</p><p>So what we have now is an updated manifesto that looks like this:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2020)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><s>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</s></em></li><li><em><s>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</s></em></li><li><em><s>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</s></em></li><li><em>Scales per request; </em><em><s>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</s></em></li><li><em><s>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</s></em></li><li><em><s>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</s></em></li><li><em><s>Intentional time and space constraints</s></em></li><li><em><s>Zero-trust networking</s></em></li></ul><p>I feel like Willy Wonka at the end of the chocolate factory tour, looking around to see where all the children went. Of all those ideological principles, those lines in the sand, <em>per-request scaling is the only thing left.&nbsp;</em></p><p>You can still build according to the original serverless manifesto, of course. But the service doesn’t <em>require </em>you to.</p><p>If you had to distill the revised value prop of Lambda down into a single maxim, <em>Animal Farm-</em>style, what would you even say at this point? “<em>All workloads are managed, but some are more managed than others?</em>“</p><h2 id="h-the-rise-of-serverless-for-everyone">The rise of serverless for everyone</h2><p>This seems like the right time to clarify that I mostly like the additions to Lambda. I think they are necessary and in many cases, an unmixed good.</p><p>I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. I was much more of a FaaS purist at that time. What changed my mind was years of hearing a very particular type of statement from engineering teams, repeated over and over in different variations:</p><p><strong><em>I would love to use Lambda, if only it …</em></strong><em> </em>[connected back to my on-prem VPC, was big enough to run my workload, let me use the same language or developer tooling as my other systems, was always warm, supported some form of shared storage, etc, etc]</p><p>My first reaction to these statements was: Why would you want to use Lambda if you can’t or won’t embrace stateless, containerless, scale-to-zero functions? That’s the whole <em>point </em>of Lambda. It sounded to me like those Kubernetes cats from the New Stack survey, saying they’d really like to eat vegetables if they only contained more meat.</p><p>But I’ve since come to understand that the really powerful part of that statement is the beginning part. It’s a statement of longing.</p><p><em>I’d love to use Lambda, if only …</em></p><p>What is it about Lambda, and serverless compute in general, that inspires this reaction in so many people? Why does a brand-new baby computing paradigm spark such compulsive interest everywhere from tiny startups to big ol’ legacy enterprises?</p><p>Because more than any specific technical detail, serverless computing is an idea. An idea expressed in a simple phrase: <em>Own less, build more. </em>All the serverless doctrine, all the technical guidance boils down to this goal.

<p>Not everyone understands how open source is made. I received the following email from NASA a while ago.</p>



<h2>Subject: Curl Country of Origin and NDAA Compliance</h2>



<blockquote><p>Hello, my name is [deleted] and I am a Supply Chain Risk Management Analyst at NASA. As such, I ensure that all NASA acquisitions of Covered Articles comply with Section 208 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law 116-94, enacted December 20, 2019. To do so, the Country of Origin (CoO) information must be obtained from the company that develops, produces, manufactures, or assembles the product(s). To do so, please provide an email response or a formal document (a PDF on company letterhead is preferred, but a simple statement is sufficient) specifically identifying the country, or countries, in which Curl <strong>is developed and maintained</strong></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If the country of origin is outside the United States, please provide any information you may have stating that testing is performed in the United States prior to supplying products to customers. Additionally, if available, please identify all authorized resellers of the product in question.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Lastly, please confirm that Curl <strong>is not developed by, contain components developed by</strong>, or receive substantial influence from entities prohibited by Section 889 of the 2019 NDAA. These entities include the following companies and any of their subsidiaries or affiliates:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Hytera Communications Corporation<br>Huawei Technologies Company<br>ZTE Corporation<br>Dahua Technology Company<br>Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company</p><p>Finally, we have a time frame of 5 days for a response.<br>Thank you,</p></blockquote>



<h2>My answer</h2>



<p>Okay, I first considered going with strong sarcasm in my reply due to the complete lack of understanding, and the implied threat in that last line. What would happen if I wouldn’t respond in time?</p>



<p>Then it struck me that this could be my chance to once and for all get a confirmation if curl is already actually used in space or not. So I went with informative and a friendly tone.</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi [name],</p><p>I will answer to these questions below to the best of my ability, and maybe you can answer something for me?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>curl (https://curl.se) is an open source project that creates two products, curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. I am the founder, lead developer and core maintainer of the project. To this date, I have done about 57% of the 26,000 changes in the source code repository. The remaining 43% have been done by 841 different volunteers and contributors from all over the world. Their names can be extracted from our git repository: https://github.com/curl/curl</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You can also see that I own most, but not all, copyrights in the project.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am a citizen of Sweden and I’ve been a citizen of Sweden during the entire time I’ve done all and any work on curl. The remaining 841 co-authors are from all over the world, but primarily from western European countries and the US. You could probably say that we live primarily “on the Internet” and not in any particular country.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have resellers. I work for an American company (wolfSSL) where we do curl support for customers world-wide.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Our testing is done universally and is not bound to any specific country or region. We test our code substantially before release.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Me knowingly, we do not have any components or code authored by people at any of the mentioned companies.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So finally my question: can you tell me anything about where or for what you use curl? Is it used in anything in space?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Regards,<br>Daniel</p></blockquote>



<h2>Used in space?</h2>



<p>Of course my attempt was completely in vain and the answer back was very brief and it just said…</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NASA_logo.png" alt="" width="399" height="334"></figure></div>

                <p>Noah Kagan is a pretty busy dude. At age 24 he was employee #30 at Facebook. After leaving Facebook he served as Marketing Director at <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/">Mint.com</a> helping grow the company to over 1 million users. He then founded <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/11/gambit-helps-game-developers-make-more-real-money-from-virtual-goods/">Gambit</a> which helped game companies add in-app purchases and then after being sued launched AppSumo.</p><h2 id="coming-up-with-app-sumo">Coming up with App Sumo</h2><p>While running Gambit, <strong>Noah ran into customers complaining that they needed less monetisation tools and more customers,</strong> and after two years living on his mother's couch he realised exactly how to do that.</p><p>He had the idea to create a weekly deal platform to help people grow their business. <strong>To get the MVP done fast, he outsourced building a small sales page to a freelancer for $50.</strong></p><p>Next Noah researched AppSumo's competitor <a href="http://macheist.com/">Macheist</a>, a website that bundled and resold Mac OS X software, luckily for Noah they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist">shared their sales revenue publicly</a>.</p><p>From these revenue numbers, he was able to quickly figure out what profit Macheist was making per bundle. This gave him a major insight into how App Sumo should charge and operate.</p><figure><img src="https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://validationguide.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png 838w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l7F-n0ZmXaUEvzXtLu6GVyx6taaeQpkhZYRAgsIeReA/edit?usp=sharing">Link to spreadsheet</a></p><h2 id="validating-appsumo">Validating AppSumo</h2><p>Noah knew the AppSumo model would work from the above calculations but he didn't know whether people would buy digital goods on a time-limited basis. So in order to validate this hypothesis he needed to find a product with an audience that he could test it on.</p><p>He decided to use Imgur.com and Reddit Ads as his initial testing product. Imgur.com was the most popular image hosting tool on Reddit and offered a paid pro account option for $25 per year which made it ideal for a time-limited offer. </p><p>In order to set this up, he cold emailed the founder of Imgur, Alan Schaaf. Promising to bring him paying customers, and would even pay Imgur for each one he converted (not a tough sell).</p><figure><img src="https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://validationguide.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 823w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/</figcaption></figure><p>In order to determine success with the ad campaign. Noah set a goal of 100 sales which would be an indicator as to whether or not the model was working. </p><p>Why 100? </p><blockquote>I decided on “100” after looking at my time value of money. If I could arrange a deal in two hours (find, secure, and launch), I wanted to have a return of at least $300 for those two hours of work. 100 sales ($3 commission per sale) was that amount. - <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">Source</a></blockquote><p>Luckily for AppSumo by the end of the ad campaign, they had sold more than 200 Imgur pro accounts.</p><h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2><ul><li><strong>Research your competitor's business models.</strong> How are they reaching customers?

Would this model work for my idea?</li><li><strong>Do stuff that doesn't scale.</strong> Cold emailing the first deal was the key to being able to test AppSumo and get early revenue.</li><li><strong>Build only whats necessary.</strong> AppSumo was a simple sales page built by a freelancer for $50. No heavy development work needed.</li><li><strong>Set a goal for your test.</strong> If AppSumo didn't hit 100 sales then Noah would have validated that the time limited deal model didn't work well.</li></ul><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-story-behind-AppSumo">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-story-behind-AppSumo</a></li><li><a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/</a></li><li><a href="https://theunconventionalists.com/tv-show/noah-kagan">https://theunconventionalists.com/tv-show/noah-kagan</a></li><li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/11/gambit-helps-game-developers-make-more-real-money-from-virtual-goods/">https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/11/gambit-helps-game-developers-make-more-real-money-from-virtual-goods/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.macheist.com/">https://www.macheist.com/</a></li></ul>

December 18, 2020 | https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I’ve had an easy time being <em>focused</em> lately. I say no to obligations or opportunities that I would have easily accepted before. I have fewer things on my todo list, which means I get to spend more time on the few things that I’ve said yes to when I sit down to be creative. I also have a stronger sense of my values – what’s important to me, and what’s less important – and that’s helped me leave more room in my schedule for myself. I’ve been thinking about why it’s easier for me to focus now, and what might have changed.</p>
<p>The most significant change in my thinking has been that <strong>I have a lot of conviction now that the few things I’m spending my time on – university, writing, side projects – are right for me.</strong> If a stranger had come up to me last year, told me I was doing it all wrong, and suggested I make different choices in my education or my work, I would have been easily swayed. Today, I feel myself standing on much firmer ground. Because I’m sure that I’m spending my time on the right things, it’s easy for me to say no to things that’ll take that time away from me for something else.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a moment in time when I suddenly decided that I was going to become focused, and started <em>having confidence</em> in what I do. Confidence doesn’t work that way – it’s <em>earned</em>, not <em>found</em>. To earn confidence (and the focus that comes with it), we need to explore our options, try things out, open all the different doors in front of us, and then say, “this is the best option for me, so I’m going to do this.” Only that kind of conviction, coming from true belief and not just blunt willpower, can give you the certainty you need to be focused on the few <em>right</em> things. I suspect this is the reason many students who take gap years or gap semesters return with more confidence and perspective. They’ve explored more of their options, and find themselves more focused.</p>
<p>All this has me convinced that <strong>focus isn’t just stubbornly saying “I’m going to say no to more things,” it’s studying all the options you have until you can say with conviction, “this is the right one for me."</strong> Paradoxically, this means attaining focus requires us to become <em>less focused</em> for a little bit, exploring our options enough to develop some conviction around what’s important or what feels right.</p>
<p>At any moment, we are either in a <em>divergent</em> phase of life, or in a <em>convergent</em> phase. During a divergent period, we’re usually focused on broadening our inputs. We go to school, take on internships, travel, try a career switch, and so on, exploring new paths. During a convergent time, we take what we’ve learned thus far to double down on just a handful of goals on which we can spend our energy – we become more focused. We grow fastest not by converging constantly onto some single point set from the start, but over cycles of divergence and convergence that come and go like seasons.</p>
<p>These cycles of divergence and convergence come from the heart, not from circumstance. You can’t force yourself to become focused by picking an option when you aren’t sure that it’s right. If your choice isn’t based on the confidence you have in that decision, your focus ends up pulled apart by the worry that you’ve missed out on the roads not taken.</p>
<p>Focus is a destination, not a path. And the only way to get there is to earn the confidence to feel that what you’re working on is the right one for you, so you can say no to everything else. And the only way to feel right in what you do is to try your chances with the paths that might be wrong, too. That isn’t wasted effort – it’s what’s required of us to earn our focus.</p>
<p>So if you feel lost or directionless, instead of making yourself pick a direction while lost at sea, consider drifting for a bit. Try things out. Open the unopened doors. Say yes to a few more things. And then when you feel the winds turning, set your sail to what feels right, indisputably and confidently right. It might take more time, and you might feel behind sometimes, but when you finally set off, you won’t need to look back.</p>

<p>All around us, we are surrounded by crappy software. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2020/04/25/preventing-software-rot/" target="_blank">Pension funds that are stumbling along using decades old batch scripts with faulty assumptions</a>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach" target="_blank">Credit agencies leaking over a hundred million social security numbers and other confidential data</a>. And not to even mention the tons of buggy and frustrating software that we see all around us, from smaller vendors and older enterprise software.</p>



<p>Such incompetence would never fly in other engineering disciplines. We would never put up with bridges that are as buggy as your average software system. So why is software engineering so bad? Why is there so much crap software out there?</p>

<p>To understand the reason, we need to first understand how developer skill is related to the usefulness of the software they produce for a given task.</p>

<p>In the first bucket, you have the “developers” who are effectively incompetent. You might see a wide range of skill levels within this bucket… but they are all similar in that their end-product is functionally useless. Computers are ruthless in that regard – if you can’t figure out how to make your app compile, you might as well have not written it at all. If you can’t figure out how to build the core functionality of your app, absolutely no one will use it. Below a certain skill threshold, you will not produce any usable software. Most “developers” in this bucket may dabble with coding in their free time, but you will rarely find them producing professional software.</p>



<p>Once you go past this threshold however, things change. At the lower end, the developers are now good enough to produce minimally viable software systems. And as these developers get better and better, the usefulness of their software improves rapidly as well. An app that “worked” but was slow, buggy, insecure, and incomprehensible… slowly starts to become less buggy, more performant, more secure, and easier to understand. Unlike the other two buckets, as the developers in this bucket grow their skills, the software they produce becomes significantly better.</p>



<p>And finally, when developers reach a certain threshold of skill, they cross over into the third bucket. A bucket where everyone has reached such a high level of competency (relative to the problem they are solving), that further personal-growth will make minimal difference to the end product. Ie, any random staff engineer at Google can build a CRUD app that is just as good as Jeff Dean’s.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>In an ideal world</strong>, the only developers in the first and second buckets would be students or entry-level hires. And all professional software systems would be primarily built by developers in the third bucket. Developers who have mastered all the skills needed to solve the assigned problem, and produce solutions that are pretty darn close to the platonic ideal. In such a heavenly world, all the software that we see around us, would be at a similarly high level of quality … performing exactly as expected, at optimal performance, with no security holes. A world where the general public reacts to all software with joy, not frustration.</p>



<p>However, there are two problems standing between us and this utopia.</p>



<p>First, the number of developers in the 3rd bucket is exceedingly small, relative to the second bucket. Programming is a “easy to learn, hard to master” activity. Millions of people can write a functional script, but very few have mastered the art of software engineering. Further, there is no gatekeeping for the software industry whatsoever – no software equivalent to the American Medical Association, or the Bar Association for lawyers. Not surprisingly, you have far more people who are of novice and intermediate competency, as opposed to expert competency.</p>



<p>Second, the demand for developers is immense. There are opportunities for software developers to make huge improvements, in almost every single industry. Compared to more niche professions such as astronomy, where opportunities are severely limited, software development is a talent-constrained field. Ie, the main bottleneck is finding talented software developers, not finding useful work for them to do.</p>



<p>Combine both of these problems, and most companies that want to hire expert developers are locked out from doing so. There aren’t enough expert developers available for them to hire, and the ones that do often have unmatchably high offers from FANG companies or hot startups.</p>



<p>And so, every other company does the next best thing. They hire developers from the second bucket. Developers who can broadly be categorized as “good enough”. Their apps have bugs, security vulnerabilities, and they fail to handle high loads. But at least they are able to build something that “works”. Something that is more useful than the status-quo. Something that can be rolled out into production with minimal regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>You might be tempted</strong> to think that the above is a natural state of the world, across all professions. But that is actually not the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are tons of jobs that fall into the “easy to master” category. Jobs like being a taxi driver, or a construction worker, or a bartender. Jobs where a large fraction of  workers have reached the master-competency bucket, and there are severely diminishing returns to further improvements in skill.</p>



<p>And there are also tons of professions where opportunities are so limited, that employers can choose to hire only those with expert competency. For example, pianists. Amateur pianists abound in every family gathering, but you will never find them playing in a concert hall, given that the number of talented pianists far outstrips the number of scheduled concerts.</p>



<p>And finally, you have the jobs that are hard to master, with plentiful opportunities, but regulatory barriers to entry. For example, medical doctors. In a pre-Obamacare world, there were plenty of people who couldn’t afford health insurance, who would have chosen “some” healthcare over no healthcare at all <em>(whether or not that is advisable, is a whole other can of worms)</em>. And yet, because of strict regulations, only those showing great competency are allowed to offer medical services. Similarly for many other engineering disciplines that face tremendous regulatory oversight, such as building bridges or skyscrapers or medical devices.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Software development is a curious cross-section</strong> of all the above. It is easy to learn, so legions of “good enough” developers exist all around the world. Developers who build software solutions that are somewhat useful, but littered with bugs and security vulnerabilities. And at the same time, it is hard to master, so developers who can avoid the above pitfalls, are much harder to find.</p>



<p>Software development is so opportunity-rich, that most employers find it almost impossible to recruit expert-developers. It is so opportunity-rich, that despite the veritable legions of novice developers worldwide, jobs exist for each and every one of them.</p>



<p>And lastly, software engineering has no gatekeeping whatsoever. Anyone can attend a coding bootcamp, take a few online coding classes, and start selling their services on Upwork the next day. And their work product can be rolled out into production immediately, with no regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>Combine all three, and it is easy to see why there’s so much crappy software out there. Software is eating the world, and so too are its bugs and security holes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: As critical as this article may sound, I am not recommending that we gatekeep the software profession, or subject all software systems to regulatory approval. This is meant to be a descriptive essay, not prescriptive. </em></p>



<p><em>This essay also focuses solely on the developer side of the equation.

    <p>I was explaining about docker to my colleagues and I was struck by an epiphany: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a> is essentially object oriented programming (OOP) for systems programming. For the uninitiated Docker is OS-level virtualization that allow you to package softwares and make the installations easy and reproducible across systems. No more <em>but it worked on my computer</em> problems. Follow this <a href="https://kevalnagda.github.io/getting-started-with-docker">tutorial from Keval</a> to get a good idea of how it works. In this post, I’ll quickly review the docker concepts so that we can make the connection to OOP.</p>

<p>In docker, you build an <em>image</em> by specifying instructions in <code>Dockerfile</code> on how to install your application. You can think of an image as packaged file system containing your programs. For example, here’s how you build an image.</p>

<pre><code># Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install numpy
CMD python3 -m http.server
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>Dockerfile</code> starts with <code>FROM ubuntu:18.04</code> which means you’re using ubuntu 18.04 as base image and <code>RUN</code>s the next two commands in this image. <code>CMD</code> specifies the default command when you run this image. You build the image by running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>docker build <span>-t</span> numpy <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once built, you can use this image to spin up an <em>container</em> in which you can run whatever you want. Let’s spin up a container and run python.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ docker run -it numpy python3
Python 3.6.9 (default, Oct  8 2020, 12:12:24) 
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously numpy is already installed in this container. How do we get input and output to this container? We can use file system and/or networking to interact with the container. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>input_dir
<span>$ </span><span>touch </span>input_dir/hi
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"hello sasank"</span> <span>&gt;</span> input_dir/hi
<span>$ </span>docker run <span>-p</span> 8001:8000 <span>-v</span> <span>`</span><span>pwd</span><span>`</span>/input_dir:/root/input numpy 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>-p</code> publishes port 8001 from docker and maps it to port number 8000 (the default python server port) inside docker. <code>-v</code> mounts input_dir in the present directory to <code>/root/input</code> of the container. In a different terminal, you can verify that the filesystem and network I/O worked with curl.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl localhost:8001/root/input/hi
hello sasank
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now why am I calling this object oriented programming? Let’s start with clarifying what OOP is. In OOP, we have a <em>class</em> which encapsulates the <em>data</em> and <em>methods</em> of a particular functionality. For example, <code>Human</code> can be class whose data is the name and method is <code>what_is_your_name()</code>. You’ll have to create an <em>instance</em> of the <code>Human</code> class (say <code>sasank</code>) to interact with it. Once instantiated, the only way to interact with this instance is through the method (e.g., <code>sasank.what_is_your_name()</code>). What the class does internally is treated like a black box. A class can <em>inherit</em> data and methods from another class (say <code>Animal</code>)</p>

<p>Docker image is exactly like a class in which you define instructions to install your app. Data of this class is the code to run your app. Methods are what your app does. <code>FROM</code> is inheritance where you can inherit data and methods from a previously built image. You instantiate an image by spinning up a container. You interact with your container through filesystem and networking. What the container does internally is not your problem. I summarized the argument below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Docker</th>
      <th>Object Oriented Programming</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Image</td>
      <td>Class</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Installed packages and code</td>
      <td>Data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CMD</code> and what your code does</td>
      <td>Methods</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FROM</code></td>
      <td>Inheritance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Container</td>
      <td>Instance</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You usually make different classes interact with each other by <em>composition</em> where each interact with other through methods. This is exactly the use case of <code>docker-compose</code> where you can make different container interact with each other. For example your backend and front end can be two containers which can be composed in the following way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>version: "3"
services:
  backend:
    image: jodogne/orthanc-plugins
    ports:
      - 8042:8042

  frontend:
    image: ohif/viewer
    ports:
      - 3000:80

volumes: 
  orthanc_db:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All in all, docker is just OOP for systems programming. No wonder we all love docker and its abstractions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><section><p><em>This article was also published on <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/chrome-extension-tutorial-replace-images-in-any-website-with-pikachu-de2a6e3548bb">Level Up Coding's gitconnected</a></em></p><p>What’s a better way to learn how to make a Chrome extension than making the web cuter with Pikachu images?</p><p>In this tutorial, I will show you how you can create a simple Chrome extension that replaces images on websites with Pikachu images. We will discuss topics like content scripts, background scripts, and messages between scripts in Chrome extensions.</p><p>The code for this tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/shahednasser/pikachu-everywhere" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>First thing you need to do when creating any chrome extension is start with creating a <strong><strong>manifest.json </strong></strong>file in the root of the extension’s directory. For now, this file will hold only the following basic information about your extension:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here is what everything in this file means:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>name:</strong></strong> The name of the extension. I named the extension “Pikachu Everywhere”</li><li><strong><strong>version</strong></strong>: This is the version of the extension. When you publish the extension in the Chrome Web Store and you need to update it, you will have to increase the version number so it’s good to start with a low number.</li><li><strong><strong>description: (Optional) </strong></strong>Description of your extension</li><li><strong><strong>manifest_version</strong></strong>: As of Chrome 18, developers are required to use manifest version 2, since manifest version 1 is now deprecated.</li><li><strong><strong>icons: (Optional) </strong></strong>Here we specify the extension’s icon. This icon will show up in your browser’s toolbar, the Chrome Web Store, and any other place that requires to show it. For that reason, it’s good to include different sizes of the icon. I have used an icon from <a href="https://www.freeiconspng.com/img/17360" rel="noopener">Free Icons PNG</a> and resized the icons using <a href="https://resizeimage.net/" rel="noopener">https://resizeimage.net/</a> (You can find the images in the <a href="https://github.com/shahednasser/pikachu-everywhere" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>). The paths specified for these images is relative to the root of the extension.</li></ol><p>With this, we have the core of any Chrome extension. Next, we’ll add the extension to the browser.</p><p>Go to chrome://extensions. There, you can toggle developer mode at the top right corner. Once you do that, a new toolbar will show up with three buttons: “Load unpacked,” “Pack extension,” and “Update.” Click on “Load unpacked” and choose your extension’s directory.</p><p>Once you do that, you will see that your new chrome extension is now working. Yes, it does nothing, but it’s working.</p><p>In Chrome extensions, there are two types of scripts you can use. There are Background scripts and Content scripts. Background scripts run (obviously) in the background. They are loaded when needed and unloaded when idle. They are used to listen to certain events in your Chrome extension.</p><p>Content scripts are scripts loaded once you open a website and injected it into it. Once you open a website, they will start running just like any other script on that website. After you close the website, the content scripts on that website will stop running as well.</p><p>For our extension, we want to replace every image on every website with Pikachu images. In order to do that we need to specify a content script that works every time you open a web page.</p><p>Let’s create our content script in <code>assets/js/contentScript.js</code> and include the following script to test whether our extension is working or not:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>One other thing we need to do is tell Chrome which script do we need to run as a content script. Add the following lines to <strong><strong>manifest.json</strong></strong></p><figure></figure><p>Here we are using <code>content_scripts</code> as key with the value as an array. Here’s what everything in the array means:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>matches</strong></strong>: here you can specify which URLs the content script should run on. In our case we want our content script to run on all pages. So, we use the placeholder “&lt;all_urls&gt;” to specify that.</li><li><strong><strong>all_frames</strong></strong>: this key is used to allow the extension to specify if JavaScript and CSS files should be injected into all frames matching the specified URL requirements or only into the topmost frame in a tab.</li><li><strong><strong>js: </strong></strong>here we specify the script we want to run as a content script. You can specify more than one script, so the value has to be an array</li></ol><p>Now we’re ready to test our content script.</p><p>But before we do that we need to do one small step. In order to inform chrome that we updated our chrome extension, we need to go back to chrome://extensions, go to our extension, and press the reload icon.</p><p>To test if our content script is working, go to any web page you want, reload the page if it was opened before, then right-click and press Inspect. In DevTools, open the Console tab. You will see in your console as expected:</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-1.png"><figcaption>Console of a web page</figcaption></figure><p>So, we can verify that our content script is working. Try reloading the page, and the content script will execute again. Try opening another web page, and the content script will execute on that page independently.</p><p>Now, we know how to inject a script on any web page, and through that script we can do our work.</p><p>In our case, we need to replace every image in any website with random Pikachu images. To do that, we will use <a href="https://some-random-api.ml/img/pikachu" rel="noopener">this API</a> which will provide us with a JSON object containing the link of a Pikachu image. Each request to that API will look something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-2.png"><figcaption>Result of API call</figcaption></figure><p>With the help of this API, the steps to achieve what we need will be as follows:</p><ol><li>Get all image elements on the web page.</li><li>Perform a GET request to the API to retrieve a random Pikachu image link.</li><li>Replace the image elements’ <code>src</code> attributes with the links we retrieve.</li></ol><p>This all sounds good and easy, but there is one complication: content scripts in Chrome extensions cannot perform Cross-Origin requests.</p><p>So how can we fetch the image URLs from the API? We will need to use a Background script.</p><p>As we specified earlier, Background scripts run in the background in Chrome. They are not dependent on any web page.</p><p>Scripts in Chrome extensions are isolated from each other. However, they share a mean of communication through the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index" rel="noopener">Chrome API</a>.</p><p>What we will do is that we will listen for a message in the <strong><strong>background</strong></strong> script sent from <strong><strong>content</strong></strong> scripts. Every time a web page opens, our content script will run, send a message to the background script requesting an image URL. The background script will then perform the asynchronous call to the Pikachu API, retrieve the link and send it back to the content script.</p><p>This may sound complicated at first, but it’s actually done in a very simple manner.</p><p>Let us first start by creating the background script and see it in action. Create <code>assets/js/background.js</code> with the following content:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now, we need to tell Chrome that the file we just created will be our background script. In order to do that, we need to go back to our <strong><strong>manifest.json</strong></strong> and add the following:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here is what everything means:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>scripts: </strong></strong>An array that holds the paths of the scripts we will use as background scripts. In our case, it’s just one.</li><li><strong><strong>persistent</strong></strong>: should always be false unless the extension uses Chrome’s Web Request API to block or modify network requests.</li></ol><p>Now, Chrome will know about our background script. It will load it when it’s needed, and unload it when it becomes idle.</p><p>To test our background script, we need to reload our extension as we did earlier.</p><p>Once you do that, you will see a new link appear in your extension’s info box with the text “inspect views background page”:</p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-3.png"></figure><p>If you click on it, a new DevTool will open and in the console you will see:</p><figure><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-4.png"></figure><p>We can now confirm that our background script is working. Even if you close any other web page or reload any web page, nothing will change in the background script.</p><p>Let’s go back to our objective again. We now need to listen to messages in our background script, and on receiving a new message fetch the URL from the Pikachu API.</p><p>In order to listen to messages, we will use the following method in Chrome’s API:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We need to pass a function to <code>addListener</code>. This function will be executed on receiving any new message. The function takes three parameters:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>message: </strong></strong>the message sent of type any.</li><li><strong><strong>sender: </strong></strong>of type <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#type-MessageSender" rel="noopener">MessageSender</a></li><li><strong><strong>senderResponse: </strong></strong>Callback function to call (at most once) when you have a response. This function is sent by the sender on sending the message.</li></ol><p>So this is what our <strong><strong>background.js </strong></strong>file should look like now:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now our background script is ready to receive messages, but there are no messages being sent.</p><p>As we said earlier, each time a page opens, our content script will loop through image elements in the web page, and send a message to the background script to fetch the Pikachu image link.</p><p>In order to send messages, we will need to use the following method from Chrome’s API:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The parameter’s being sent are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>extensionId: (Optional) </strong></strong>the ID of the extension we are sending the message to.

This is the <strong><strong>senderResponse</strong></strong> parameter in the previous method we saw.</li></ol><p>So, we will use this method in our content script to send a message to the background script to fetch the Pikachu URL from the API. Our content script should now look like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here’s what we’re doing in the above code:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Line 1: </strong></strong>get all image elements on the web page.</li><li><strong><strong>Line 2–6: </strong></strong>Loop through the image elements. On each element, we send a message to the background script. As you can tell, we are omitting the optional <strong><strong>extensionId </strong></strong>and <strong><strong>options</strong></strong> parameters. The first parameter is the <strong><strong>message </strong></strong>we are sending, and the second parameter is the callback function we want the background to execute after it fetches the image’s link.</li></ol><p>We are sending the object <strong><strong>{msg: ‘image’, index: i}</strong></strong> to our extension. This object has two properties. The first one is to specify what our message is about. In our extension, it might not be very helpful, but when you have an extension that uses different types of messages, it’s a good idea to differentiate what each message is for. The second property is to specify the index of the image the link is for in the <strong><strong>images</strong></strong> array. The reason behind this is that the callback function replacing the image will be called asynchronously, so <strong><strong>i </strong></strong>might point at another index at the time it’s being executed.</p><p>The callback function receives an object that has two properties. <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> will be the data received from the API call, and <strong><strong>index</strong></strong> will be the index …</p></section></section></div>

<p>2020 was actually a first-class year for technological innovation, but it will probably also go down in history as the year of the ultimate frustration of discouraged consumers, when the target group will end up not being able to buy what has been on their wish list for a long time: graphics cards and processors, power supplies and last but not least the ready-made solution in the form of the current consoles such as a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Why is such a shortage arising in the first place? The big brands that are ultimately at stake (Sony, Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD) all talk about “demand exceeding supply”. Oh, really?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1024x491.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="491" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1024x491.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-768x368.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-990x475.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1320x633.jpg 1320w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU.jpg 1766w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>It is a rather evasive explanation, without any communication about the actual state of their supply and production lines. Every company, regardless of its size, also employs highly experienced specialists who plan production and procurement for the long term and create a so-called forecast, which is nothing more than a complex foresight that takes all factors into account. It is certainly possible for a company to miss the mark, as the example of AMD and Vega shows, where in the end they forgot to plan the packaging in advance with sufficient resources. But that suddenly everyone is supposed to be equally wrong is then rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Of course, one can go in search of causes and traces, exchange ideas with colleagues, tap and evaluate various own sources and also include the findings of other specialized media, which often have incomparably better access to the makers behind the scenes. The first conclusion that could be drawn fairly quickly is the common statement of almost everyone that the situation is really serious at the moment and will continue at least until spring 2021, because its causes are manifold and more complex than many company representatives would like to communicate publicly. In the end it is a causal chain, where all the imponderables and shortcomings also impressively show the negative side of globalisation.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The explosion of demand exists, but is not the only reason</strong></span></h3>
<p>The explosive growth in demand for various IT products is undeniable. First of all because of teleworking in the home office: printers and laptops are sold well and one of the leading providers of webcams even reported a historic sales record. On the gaming side, 2020 will see the most attractive market launch in a long time, driving new customers and upgraders into the shops in equal measure. Consoles like the PS5 or Xbox Series X, graphics cards like NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3000 or AMD’s RX 6000, new CPUs like the Ryzen 5000 series and finally, of course, box office hits like Apple’s M1 are fuelling a hype that is leading to a shortage of supply, as many interested parties would like to take the performance leaps (which have not been seen for several years) with them.</p>
<p>One of the largest suppliers of graphics cards explains that orders for the GeForce RTX 3000 from resellers are much higher than last year. Although the cards go out like hot cakes when they arrive, it is also explained that there are no more availability problems in relation to the number of pieces requested than in previous years. The same is also true for manufacturers of stationary gaming PCs and system integrators, who would have RTX 3000 graphics cards at their disposal, for example, but the demand is indeed greater than estimated and more and more mass retailers are entering this market, skimming off large quantities. As a result, even graphics cards of earlier generations are now affected by lack of availability. At AMD, Ryzen 4000 as a notebook CPU is becoming scarce, as is Ryzen 5000, so many manufacturers are now even switching back to Ryzen 3000. And as for AMD’s new RX-6000 series, AMD itself is talking about a transition period of up to eight weeks before it expects to meet the demand for board partner cards.</p>

<h3><span><strong>Transport problems as a historical crisis that causes additional damage</strong></span></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, traffic has been out of control and panic has been rampant. But now, at the end of 2020, the situation is even worse than in spring. For example, an industry expert working for one of the leading providers of international transport services describes this unprecedented situation as “the biggest crisis ever” in transport between Asia and the rest of the world. Prices for container transport are also skyrocketing through the United States of America, which is attempting to monopolise most sea and air transport in order to import massive amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE) in addition to conventional goods.</p>
<p>Europe must therefore pay an ever higher price for its share in order to recover the lost transport capacity: the price has risen from around 2,000 to over 6,000 dollars for a single container, and only for pure port-to-port delivery. The same applies to air transport. A Chinese exporter explains that chartering a Boeing 747 today costs a whopping million dollars, compared to about 400,000 dollars as used to be the case. This is simply because you have to pay for the return flight of the plane, which is very likely to be empty, since there is currently a very large imbalance in the import-export market between China and Europe.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the price per kilo for air transport has doubled worldwide and Europe is increasingly resorting to the new Silk Road, which China has pushed very hard: conventional road and rail transport, the prices of which have even tripled in the meantime! Especially bulky peripherals, such as PC screens, are also suffering greatly: according to a well-known brand, prices rose by 15 or 25% in France, for example. According to the information, some computer components, sometimes even graphics cards, are now sent to Europe without their packaging as so-called “bulk goods” in order to save volume: they are packed into cartons on arrival later, if at all. Dead on Arrival? Not to be ruled out, which then causes even more frustration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_155103" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155103"><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1024x581.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1536x872.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-2048x1163.jpg 2048w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-187x105.jpg 187w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-990x562.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1320x749.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-155103">Delivery from the online retailer without any cardboard box (igor’sLAB Forum)</figcaption></figure>
<p>
But on the transport side, even the deadline for technological products, which are often small, light and of high quality, remains a constant issue. Because the real problem at the moment is the lead time: it takes about 4 to 5 weeks to get transport space at all, which is four times longer than normal. By road and rail, crossing certain borders between China and Europe now takes an average of 10 days, whereas it used to take 3 days. This is pretty bad timing in the middle of the Christmas season and this delay will continue until at least next March according to sources.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Production as a taboo subject with serious consequences</strong></span></h3>
<p>The manufacturing industry is also currently in a historically difficult situation. The manufacturers of various products such as processors, motherboards or graphics cards officially do not appear to be overly concerned about this, but unfortunately the reality often looks completely different, as the entire production chain is, for various reasons, sometimes extremely disrupted (broken chain). First of all, the Taiwanese foundry TSMC is completely overwhelmed by the demand. The reason is actually quite simple: With the exception of the current RTX 3000 (Samsung), all market launches of the year 2020 rely on the 7-nm chips from TSMC. ARM-SoC manufacturers such as Qualcomm also use 7 nm and have only recently moved capacity from Samsung to TSMC. TSMC is currently pretty much alone in the market with this technology and the production lines are therefore working at full capacity. A sudden increase in production is therefore not possible.</p>
<p>A special insulating film, the so-called ABF substrate (Ajinomoto Build-up Film), which is indispensable for etching chips in 7 and 5 nm, has also become increasingly scarce and scarce in recent months. The prices for this film are said to have risen by 40% and the waiting time is said to have increased to up to 4 months. If manufacturers are now declaring that the shortage is likely to continue for a long time to come, it is also because the few suppliers of ABF substrate, such as Unimicron, Kinsus or Na Ya, are declaring that they will not be able to increase their production for another three quarters.</p>
<p>Other components make things even more complicated: The small additional chips (controller, supervisor, etc.) from ST Micro, NXP or Infineon are also missing due to another deficiency: silicon wafers with 8 inch diameter. Many products then suffer from this, such as PC power supplies, but also consoles of the PS5 and Xbox series X and the graphics cards. Flash memory and DRAMs, on the other hand, do not seem to be in real short supply, and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are not as drastic as is often claimed, as the unaffected production capacities are now back to full capacity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1024x572.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1536x858.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-470x264.jpg 470w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-414x232.jpg 414w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-215x120.jpg 215w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-187x105.jpg 187w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-990x553.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1320x737.jpg 1320w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>The political situation between China and the USA makes the situation even worse. Many Chinese productions are blocked by American trade restrictions, which makes the logistics of component assembly very difficult. Trade between China and Taiwan, which used to be very fluid and easy, is now becoming increasingly delicate and difficult. If some manufacturers are talking about a better situation in February, it is also because they expect a change of the American president and a relaxation of sanctions.</p>
<h3><span>Shortage? Not for all</span></h3>
<p>Not all manufacturers are equally affected. It seems that NVIDIA and Apple have each secured a large amount of ABF substrate thanks to their market position. Apple is on the 5 nm TSMC lines alone with a small chip (119 mm²), which is easier to produce in large quantities. NVIDIA, for its part, avoids bottlenecks at TSMC by producing in 8 nm at Samsung, whose performance remains competitive despite much larger GPUs (392 and 628 mm²). The two giants are doing quite well in this respect. According to our information, the next GeForce RTX 3060 (Ti) …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>At first glance this appears to be a typical cheap microATX motherboard. Four DIMM slots arranged weird, a form-factor close to FlexATX but not quite, an expansion slot missing in one position and replaced with an M.2 slot in another, and a BGA processor that’s not a true SoC since it needs a separate chipset. The single video output and basic stereo audio suggest that this is meant to be used in a rather barebones system, perhaps an embedded system, but those tend to be green rather than this ugly brown. A set of dull, rectangular finstacks cool the chipset and VRMs. The only colorful part of the motherboard is the header for front-panel lights and buttons; every other slot, socket, and port is black. This is the sort of motherboard you’d find in a $300 Walmart special, not a shiny new gaming PC.</p>

<p>But I’m willing to overlook the spartan options and drab aesthetic for the novelty of a PC that uses an Xbox One APU.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted AMD to offer the Xbox One APU in a PC motherboard since 2013, and I never expected it to actually be made. It’s ironic that it’s only available now that the Xbox Series X is out. As soon as I learned it was available, I spent one-hundred and thirty-two United States dollars to ship a completely obsolete computer compoment with little hope of support from anybody in the supply chain from the other side of the planet, plus thirty-two dollarydoos for a kit of DDR3 because it isn’t even polite enough to boot with the RAM I had on hand.</p>

<p>But damn am I glad that this wasn’t available in 2013 because it would have cost a few hundred dollars mininum and, as a naive teenager and recent convert to PC, I actually would have had high hopes for it. My hopes today for anything approaching good performance have been thoroughly crushed. Waiting for benchmark runs to finish on an Athlon 5350 even with subambient cooling and a solid overclock will do that. This motherboard is only exciting now because it’s novel, but frankly it would’ve been mediocre in 2013 even if it had all the bells and whistles. It is completely obsolete now that Raven Ridge APUs exist. Actually I think my Crimson Canyon NUC would outperform this in nearly every metric, and the CPU in that thing is literally broken and was only ever sold because Intel needed to make shareholders happy.</p>

<p>Worst of all, even if you’re willing to accept that ok sure the seven-year-old APU based on a tablet architecture is kinda crap, you’re in for a rough time actually using it. The BIOS is half broken and AMD doesn’t officially distribute drivers, so you’re SOL if you want to <em>use the GPU</em>, which is <em>kinda the point of a game console.</em> Drivers are available, but the only public link is thanks to one guy in the Anglosphere who used a VPN to download them from a Japanese server that forbids foreign IP addresses and then hosted them on One Drive and dropped the link on the Linus Tech Tips forums.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> If you’re buying it new, then you can contact the seller, but I’m not sure how long they’ll be in business or how well they archive things.</p>

<p>Anyway, who wants to go down a rabbit hole?</p>



<h2 id="a-very-brief-history">A Very Brief History</h2>

<p>In short, AMD rebranded the Xbox One APU as a chip codenamed Cato and Chinese OEMs are now selling it for use in desktop PCs, but it actually seems that it was originally intended for embedded systems. Cato only emerged in 2019 in a screenshot of three SKUs’ specifications, but dates on my motherboard indicate that the APU was produced starting in 2014 and the chipset itself was produced in the end of 2015. The only available GPU drivers are based on version 17.12, which was released at the end of 2017. The GPU is reported as a 300-series part, which suggests a launch date around 2015. It’s hard to pin anything down for sure.</p>

<p>I can’t actually verify when or to whom this was released. AMD has kept quiet and sifting through their website has yielded nothing. A 2014 launch to enterprise customers makes more sense than a 2019 launch for mainstream PCs, but AMD refuses to let their old 28 nm cores die. Just last year in 2019 they released a new 1st-generation GCN GPU and two new Excavator APUs using years-old silicon.</p>

<p>I think the most likely possibility is a mix of these dates. AMD released an off-roadmap part around 2014 for embedded and industrial computers, but these computers are now being decommissioned and ending up in the hands of Chinese recyclers. Manufacturers in Shenzen are repurposing rather than destroying these embedded parts, and as of 2019 they are available in desktop PC motherboards.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-know">What We Know</h2>

<p>Cato is definitely the original 28 nm version of the Xbox One APU, itself codenamed Durango. Eyeballing the die next to my naked R9 280 (Tahiti-based, so 352 mm<sup>2</sup>) and making a couple sloppy measurments with my calipers indicates that the die is well over 300 mm<sup>2</sup>, which is consistent with Durango’s 363 mm<sup>2</sup> area. The package also features a shim that looks identical to the 28 nm APU, because it is the 28 nm APU.</p>

<p>There are at least three motherboards in the wild using this APU, and it’s very likely that there are at least two more. The motherboard that I have was manufactured by Biostar according to the AliExpress listing, though this seems inaccurate.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> I believe that it was manufactured by Onda, a Chinese company infamous for some frankly bizarre cryptocurrency mining-oriented motherboards. Onda sells normal components for the most part, but the ones that make it to the West are a bit more… unique.</p>

<p>Model information for the motherboard is difficult to find, to say the least. Text silkscreened onto the board reading “AMD_BL2 V2.3” is below a QR code that returns the text “PG-00-11.A77.EAMDBL20V23010100/20GB2122/0803/0060.” The AliExpress listing names Biostar as the manufacturer, but this is probably incorrect.</p>

<p>The QR code mentions the embedded A77E chipset, suggesting that this motherboard may have been designed as an embedded product first. However, the A77E die on this particular motherboard was produced in the 46th week of 2015, and my gut feeling is that it’s more likely that these chips are sourced from recyclers than from AMD’s mothballed warehouses. Seeing an NVMe-capable M.2 slot on an embedded motherboard from this period would also be unusual.</p>

<p>My motherboard is not the first version. According to silkscreening on it, it is version 2.3. Version 2.0 is shown below.</p>

<p>There are tons of common design elements, from choice of passive components to layout and I/O variety. The expansion slots are different, though. Rather than one PCIe x1 slot and an M-keyed M.2 slot, this motherboard has two PCIe x1 slots, an mSATA slot, and a half-length Mini PCIe slot. Sadly, thermal paste on the APU obscures any markings. An additional VRM phase is present, but I don’t know for which bit of the APU.</p>

<p>If there exists a version 2.0 and a version 2.3, then it stands to reason that there are also versions 2.1 and 2.2, but I have not found any.</p>

<p>The third motherboard using this APU is found in a desktop PC released by Chinese OEM Chuwi. This PC, the AeroBox, uses a different motherboard.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> There is enough in common with mine and some other Onda motherboards that it’s highly likely to be another Onda design, perhaps a verion 3.0 of the two boards discussed already. It’s the same brown, and a lot of the layout and passives are similar, but it’s the least similar of the three.</p>

<p>Like the others, there are two DIMM slots on each side of the APU and a Socket H mounting pattern for a cooler. The CMOS battery and buzzer are in the same locations, but the buzzer is actually populated on this motherboard. Only two SATA ports are present rather than four. An M-keyed M.2 slot is present, but rather than a PCIe x1 slot there is a short M.2 slot that appears to be E-keyed. This key is commonly used in wireless adapters like the present WiFi modem. Power delivery is somewhat different. An 8-pin EPS12V socket is present rather than a 4-pin ATX12V socket, and, like the earlier version of my motherboard, there are seven VRM phases. I honestly don’t know why since the APU can’t be overclocked.</p>

<p>The use of a BGA package soldered to the motherboard actually introduces a small problem for use in a PC. Standard Intel Socket H mounting holes (i.e., LGA-115X and its 75 mm square pattern) are used, but Cato’s package is much shorter than Intel’s sockets. I tried to use a Corsair H55, but I could not get the waterblock tightened onto the die properly. The included cooler is a solid block of aluminium, but it’s chunky enough to handle Cato, albeit loudly.</p>

<h2 id="the-cpu">The CPU</h2>

<p>The APU is codenamed Cato and the integrated GPU specifically appears to be codenamed Kryptos. There are several PCI IDs shared by components codenamed Cato, Kryptos, Anubis, Garfield, Garfield+, Arlene, and Pooky. I suspect that the other names, of which several are characters in the comic strip about the orange cat, are related to an implementation in the Xbox One and Xbox One S, but I cannot confirm this. Notably, there are no references to Durango, which is generally held to be the name of the Xbox One’s APU.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Cato has, or perhaps this motherboard lets it use, two different names. The AliExpress listing marketed it …</p></span></p></div></article></div>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pixel_badge_back.png" alt="Full colour art on the Pixel Badge"></p>

<p>Beautiful PCB design has thrived in the past few years. With personal projects and event badges alike, hackers have been pushing the limits of the artistic beauty they can put in their circuit boards.</p>

<p>The community of PCB enthusiasts has experimented with combining colours of silkscreen, copper or ENIG, and solder mask to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/03/22/making-more-of-me-money/" target="_blank">make sweet graphics</a>. They’ve convinced PCB houses to <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/18508-mr-robot-badge/log/64526-how-i-created-the-mr-robot-badge" target="_blank">use multiple layers of silkscreen</a>, have <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/30/hackaday-superconference-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pcb-artwork-with-brian-benchoff/" target="_blank">stamped colours of their own</a>, and have even <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/01/13/the-way-of-the-pcb-artist-how-to-make-truly-beautiful-circuit-boards/" target="_blank">gone multidimensional</a>.</p>

<p>I got hooked on event badges after falling in love with <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/08/14/hands-on-with-the-shacamp-2017-badge/" target="_blank">SHA2017</a>, and have been involved in making badges for a bunch of events ever since. For every new badge we make, we have some innate drive to push the boundary a bit further to what was already done before, both in hardware and what experience it gives its users, and in the aesthetics of the badge.</p>

<p>So naturally, when people asked for the re-production of the ESP32 WiFi LED panel badge a bunch of us had made for CampZone 2019 <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/25/campzone-2019-badge-is-begging-to-become-a-huge-billboard/" target="_blank">that had inkjet printed dithered single-colour graphics</a>, I started thinking about what’s next. Stumbling upon a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20464215" target="_blank">hacker news post</a> that showed full-colour UV inkjet printed PCBs by an Australian company called <a href="https://www.littlebird.com.au/" target="_blank">Little Bird</a>, I was amazed. Even though the limitations of PCB design had previously resulted in super creative art, having full-colour graphics in your toolbox could open up so many more possibilities.</p>

<p>The comments section of the hacker news article showed that apparently UV printing had already been done on PCBs over a decade ago, but I hadn’t seen anyone in the badge scene use it before. So I got cracking with our (amazing!) production partner Norbert of <a href="https://shop.allnetchina.cn/" target="_blank">ALLNET China</a>, and together we started experimenting with printing on our PCBs. Boy, were we in for a ride! In the remainder of this post, I’ll try to summarise all of the things we learned along the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="first-attempts">First attempts</h2>
<p>We first started thinking about getting to full colour prints by using the same dithering technique we had used for CampZone 2019, but now with many colours, because I had no idea how normal UV printing worked. Luckily, my friend Hans (aka “the maker maker”, whom I got to know via Ian of <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/" target="_blank">Dangerous Prototypes</a>) mentioned that industrial UV printers can print on many materials out of the box, including PCBs.</p>

<p>Indeed, after getting some weird looks from a company that normally makes physical store signs with their UV printers, they were happy to put some of our old unpopulated CampZone 2019 PCBs in their printer and turn them into retrowave heaven:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/1st_try.jpeg" alt="Full colour art printed over scrap CZ19 badges"></p>

<p>This initial print used standard CMYK UV ink, plus a separate white UV ink for the whites.</p>

<p>The result looked great, but we hit the same problem others before us had hit: putting printed PCBs in a reflow oven messes with the colours a lot. You might remark that it makes more sense to print on the PCBs after they have been pick&amp;placed and soldered. However, the print accuracy of inkjet printers is a function of the distance between the print jet and the object. Our printer could only move 3mm above the PCB (which was not enough for our components), and even if it could move higher the print quality would be quite bad. So instead we worked on getting the UV ink handle reflowing better.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-making-white-stay-white">Lesson 1: making white stay white</h2>

<p>After reflowing, the boards looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/1st_try_baked.png" alt="UV printed boards with white ink after reflowing"></p>

<p>You’ll notice that all colours become a bit more dim. Red seems to lose more of its edge than green and blue. Most importantly though, the white ink is turned into a nasty aged yellow. Most of the colour changes we could live with, so we didn’t correct for them in our designs (you’ll see later that our final art worked nicely with the reflow process). In general one can try to correct for the changes in their source design, of course.</p>

<p>The whites were totally unacceptable though. It made the badge look old and yucky. We considered diving into the world of different UV inks, and finding a white ink that was more heat tolerant. Then we had a simple realisation: the perfect heat resistant white ink we all know already was simply white soldermask or silkscreen. Because we want to keep the front of the badge black to keep nice contrast, we opted for keeping the mask black and experimented with white silkscreen on the back.</p>

<p>So we modified our art such that the white parts were cut out of the design, which meant no ink would be placed there, and made PCBs that were completely covered with white silk outside of the component pads. The result was awesome, even after reflowing:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/2nd_try_white.jpg" alt="UV ink on white silkscreen after reflowing"></p>

<h2 id="lesson-2-getting-decent-alignment">Lesson 2: getting decent alignment</h2>

<p>At this point we had PCBs that looked nice, but were in no way usable to solder on: many pads were partially printed over.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_pads.jpg" alt="Pads were being partially printed over"></p>

<p>We were printing entire panels at a time, and observed that even when we got perfect alignment on one panel, the next would be wildly out of spec again.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_panel.jpg" alt="Printing whole panels at a time"></p>

<p>It turned out that even though the <em>contents</em> of a panel are extremely dimensionally accurate, the <em>edge rails</em> width was not. PCB houses use alignment holes and markers on the edge rails to align their processes, and don’t need to care if there was ~0.2mm extra width on the rails after such a mark or not.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_rails.jpg" alt="PCB edge rails are not necessarily uniformly cut"></p>

<p>Aside from this, it is in general hard to get sub-mm accuracy on big industrial UV inkjet printers. For future projects, we will at least try to get better repeatability between panels by making a (very thin) jig that is a bit wider and taller than a panel, that has pins on which we slide the alignment holes of the panel. This allows you to fasten the jig to the printbed, and assure that <em>once you have tediously aligned the jig</em> the future panels will print reasonably well.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-3-more-pin-margin--more-better">Lesson 3: more pin margin == more better</h2>

<p>The alignment issue of the previous section was enlarged because we were stubborn. We felt that having close to no whitespace around pads (0.1mm) would look so much better, so literally any misalignment would immediately cause pads to be partially overprinted. It does look incredible in our opinion, but was the cause for a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. We struggled to get our failure rates below 50% (which is ridiculously high; normally we would want &lt;1%).</p>

<p>This makes the <a href="https://pixel.curious.supplies/" target="_blank">Founder’s Edition</a> extra special, as it is highly likely our last project that will have this insanely tight printing margin!
<img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pixel_badge_back.png" alt="Full colour art on the Pixel Badge"></p>

<p>For future projects, we will probably use a ~1mm margin around pins to make our life easier. For making this margin less apparent, we’ll likely incorporate the underlying mask or silk colour in the design. That way you’re not looking at chunks of white across the board :)</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>

<p>By sharing what we did, we hope to make you all excited about getting full-colour art on your designs. We’d be super psyched especially to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=badgelife" target="_blank">#badgelife</a> community pick up this neat trick for other event badges.</p>

<p>This year, American Bank Systems (ABS) was hit with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://securityreport.com/american-bank-systems-hit-by-ransomware-attack-full-53-gb-data-dump-leaked/" target="_blank">ransomware attack </a>as reported by <em>Security Report, </em>which the company failed to disclose to its customers in time.</p>



<p>As a part of this data breach, a full <strong>53 GB dump</strong> of the data pertaining to ABS and its clients —which include multiple banking names and mortgage companies, such as&nbsp;<em>First Federal Community Bank</em>,<em>&nbsp;Rio Bank</em>,&nbsp;<em>Citizens Bank of Swainsboro,</em>&nbsp;<em>First Bank &amp; Trust</em>, and so on, <strong>was leaked by the threat actors </strong>after several attempts to extort a ransom payment.</p>



<p>This data included the banking customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) such as loan records, SSNs, documents, emails, contracts, network shares, and passwords to sensitive drives.</p>



<p>A <em>Law360</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.law360.com/fintech/articles/1338684/american-bank-systems-sued-over-ransomware-data-breach-" target="_blank">news report</a> published yesterday states ABS has now been slapped with a class-action lawsuit due to its failure to protect their customers’ information, and for keeping them in the dark for weeks after the initial ransomware attack.</p>



<p>“As a result of ABS’s failure to implement and follow basic security procedures, plaintiff’s and class members’ PII is now in the hands of criminals,” read the complaint, filed Wednesday in a <strong>Pennsylvania federal court.</strong></p>



<p>“Plaintiff and class members face a substantial increased risk of identity theft, both currently and for the indefinite future. Consequently, plaintiff and class members have had to spend, and will continue to spend, significant time and money in the future to protect themselves due to ABS’s failures.”</p>



<p>As far as the timeline is concerned, <em>Security Report </em>analyzed the timestamps on the leaked files and deduced the cyber attack had struck American Bank Systems sometime <strong>in or before early October</strong>.</p>



<p>It wasn’t until November 18th, however, nearly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://securityreport.com/american-bank-systems-hit-by-ransomware-attack-full-53-gb-data-dump-leaked/" target="_blank">4 days after our report</a>, that the company began disclosing to its customers the details of the data breach. ABS had also not responded to our request for comment.</p>



<p>“According to NexTier Bank, it was not notified by ABS of the data breach until November 18, 2020, which was at least several weeks after the incident began, and more than two weeks after the data breach was first publicly reported,” the complaint further reads.</p>



<p>The class-action lawsuit is brought forward by plaintiff Mitchell Lautman, a citizen and resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and a customer of NexTier whose PII was exposed as a result of this data breach.</p>



<p>By not sufficiently protecting sensitive data the lawsuit alleges ABS was in breach of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules and put customers at the risk of identity theft for years to come.</p>



<p>“ABS, a company that promotes its trustworthiness, has a responsibility to securely maintain the customer PII that it receives and keep it safe from harm. ABS was on notice that PII, specifically when it includes financial information, is a prime target for data breaches,” states the 26-page court filing.</p>



<p>While more details pertaining to this case are yet to come, this is a reminder to companies and financial institutions to prioritize data security, and to not delay in disclosing crucial matters to their customers, such as a data breach.</p>



<p>A copy of the complaint is provided below for reference:</p>

<p><em>Warning: memes ahead</em></p>



<p>So on Monday Google services went down, and <s>the world burned</s> much productivity was disrupted.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As well as YouTube, Google search, Ads, Stadia, and Docs, GMail (the world’s <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-6-popular-free-email-providers-online-gmail-yahoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most popular</a> email host) went down too. Unlike the other services, however, Gmail remained disrupted days later, with millions of sent messages having been permanently lost. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25435916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker News</a> took note.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Email is resilient by design, with baked-in capabilities for handling networks and mailservers which are overloaded or unavailable. As the world’s largest peer-to-peer network, mail servers have to be fault-tolerant, and Gmail’s problems would normally have resulted in temporary delays to mail delivery, lasting only until Gmail came back online.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Instead however Gmail has gone haywire, sending out false signals, instead of sending nothing at all.</p>



<p>If you messaged your own Gmail account every five minutes from a non-Gmail address like Protonmail, you would have seen confusing results. Google has been alternating between successful deliveries, then permanently refusing mail sent to Gmail with hard bounce messages like: </p>



<p><code>550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist</code></p>



<p>These hard bounce messages tell other mailservers that messages sent to this address can never arrive, and therefore the message should be dropped as all future delivery attempts will be futile. These bounces tell bulk mailing systems like app registration notifications and newsletter mailing systems that the recipient address is invalid and should be permanently removed from mailing lists.</p>



<p>The effect is chaotic and long lasting: </p>



<ul><li>All mail sent to affected Gmail accounts has been unnecessarily lost, and Gmail has generated millions of false and unnecessary bounce messages</li><li>All automatically blocked email addresses on mail automation platforms like SendGrid and <a href="https://www.phplist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phpList</a> will, by default, never receive messages from those senders again</li></ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>The curious thing about this major but no doubt unintentional SNAFU on Google’s part is that it stands out in the context of a decade of deliberately false messages of a very similar type. </p>



<p><a href="https://federicoleva.eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Federico Leva</a> was the first of several Lightmeter users who messaged us on Monday and Tuesday to report that Google were up to their old tricks on a grand scale. <strong>The difference this week was that the behaviour was unintentional</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=issue&amp;sid=1&amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab"><img loading="lazy" width="845" height="372" src="https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1.png 845w, https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1-300x132.png 300w, https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px"></a><figcaption>Google later acknowledged the issue and reported it had been resolved</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gmail is known to habitually misuse technical messages between mail servers, inaccurately reporting the fate of messages which Gmail receives. </p>



<p>SMTPs most famous status response code “250 OK” is designed to communicate successful delivery; no worries, message received successfully. Not with Google. Gmail can report success but actually delete it before it reaches the user, or hide it from view in Junk. This status is sometimes called “dead air”.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">emails are back! amazing though, in the last twenty minutes I cleaned my room, finished a book, filed two pieces, learnt to play guitar, mastered spanish, humbly accepted an honorary doctorate and gave birth to beautiful twins</p>— Imogen West-Knights (@ImogenWK) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImogenWK/status/1338462872888897539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Other times Gmail honestly reports that a message delivery attempt failed, but confuse other mailservers with inaccurate explanations of that outcome. Much like in the case of this week’s erroneous <code>550-5.1.1</code> errors, Gmail intentionally responds with error codes claiming temporary technical faults, instead of reality: the message has been permanently rejected. </p>



<p>Such behaviour is presumed to be part of a strategy to waste the resources of third party mailservers from whom Google does not wish to receive mail. <strong>The effect is to decrease the reliability and efficiency of email</strong> as a whole, and to prioritise email from Gmail users above the millions of independent mail operators which constitute the <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2017-2021-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest</a> communication network. Worse, other large operators could follow Google’s example, and indeed some like Microsoft already have. This trend risks a breakdown of said distributed network as as a whole, as it gets harder and harder for independent mail networks to interact with dominant ones who are exploiting their power. </p>



<p><strong>Lightmeter’s mission is to strengthen the foundations of digital society</strong> by making mailtech easy and convenient, and keep communications free. That’s why we have built <a href="https://gitlab.com/lightmeter/controlcenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightmeter Control Center</a> to detect problems like Gmail’s errors this week, and are <a href="https://lightmeter.io/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working towards</a> automating solutions for such problems, thereby lowering barriers for indie networks, and growing the diversity and robustness of email overall. </p>

<p>With the problem resolved, Gmail users will be back in the Inboxes, happy that the disruption is over. But the mailops administrators who deal with deliberately false Gmail message reporting are back where they were before the events and the memes of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/googledown?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#GoogleDown</a>: struggling to interoperate with the largest host in the network, who’s committed to using their power to break the network’s rules.</p>

iOS UI Automation, Robotium and Selendroid.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Before talking seriously about tools for mobile app testing, we’d like to ask you a simple question. How many apps do you have on your smartphone? We’d bet the number exceeds 20. Among them, there are applications for business purposes only, there are those we use for entertainment, and then others that help us communicate…with others, or order different products and services. Of course, many of us also have apps that are our favourites, and others that we only use in the event of an urgent need. It’s likely that our favorites are the ones that have been tested and debugged to perfection – resulting in a now perfect and precise working application. </p><p>Mobile applications are actually not as simple to create, as they seem. All the average user normally notices is only the beautifully designed intuitive UI, but we know that there is so much <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/convirt_tr.pdf" target="_blank">hard work</a> behind it. Well-developed mobile applications should be fast, safe, and clear with very limited hardware possibilities. What is more, they ought to look equally as great on different devices and endure an extreme level of competition. There is only one thing that can help developers here – the frequent checking of an app’s usability, functionality, and consistency.</p><figure id="w-node-62ef5ce16f31-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d43e7cdb2da3557e0cc0d18_catching-bugs.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Mobile app quality assurance can be a challenging process, as it involves numerous possible pitfalls. For that reason, we require really useful mobile app performance testing tools. They help run the most time-consuming processes, such as cataloging, searching, and combining necessary data. This is how developers will be able to find and correct problems in their products. It’s actually crucial that special tools for mobile application testing do not perform the job alone. It is a skilled hand that can improve the technology, but all such hands, however skillful, need help from machines. In this article, we will provide you with an insight into all the major mobile app testing tools, as well as strategies and necessary procedures involved.</p><h2>Importance of mobile application testing</h2><p>One shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the mobile application testing process, because it may save developers many hours of bug fixing later on. Any app ought to do what it’s meant to under any circumstances, and only numerous tests can prepare it for ideal performance.</p><figure id="w-node-7ad8de380525-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d43e7da0a9ce33ba2df4452_mobile-app-testing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>One should understand that the average user will use the app like any of us would. We run our favorite apps on different networks and devices, start them offline or suddenly close them during use. Without being tested in each of these scenarios, your app may crash or slow down entirely. Thorough examining will help developers understand whether their program is fast and intuitive enough, has clear and pleasant navigation, looks good on any gadget and makes its customers happy.</p><h2>Types of mobile app testing procedures</h2><p>There are a great number of ways to have your app tested. Some of them help you understand if it is easy to use by looking at interface, usability, and performance. Others, like compatibility check, show the capacity to work on various devices. Finally, you shouldn’t forget about operational and security testing, which will mark an app’s capability to perform recoveries and protect its data in case of sudden shutdowns. It is said that, in future, all of these processes will become even more complex and challenging! Here, we will tell you more about the major types of mobile app examining procedures, which are necessary for strong performance of your app.</p><figure id="w-node-9e27bb952763-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d43e7e9bf5dbb0895dc468f_app-testing-procedures.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Installation testing</h3><p>This type of evaluation is important for understanding whether the app can be installed and uninstalled seamlessly. If an installation fails, it may leave a user’s system damaged, which is definitely not the kind of first impression you’d like to produce. To avoid this, you need to test the installer thoroughly with both manual and automated procedures, on different devices with distinct configurations.</p><p>Our life hack here is to make images of the base configuration (let’s say, of each new OS) when you test it, which will save you time and effort. Moreover, you can use flow diagrams to run installation check with different test cases added. You may also try breaking the installation or uninstallation process deliberately during each step. Finally, we advise you to test the reboot option after a manual uninstall.</p><h3>Usability testing</h3><p>This is actually a rather complex procedure, which includes a check of design, ease of use, and overall level of user satisfaction. Usability level measurement should reveal whether an app is really what the user wants it to be (it’s similar to reading minds, we would say). This test shows if an app’s UI is simple to navigate and meets the needs of users. Usual methods to perform this process include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Internal exploration.</strong> Here, one should create an app and perform random tests on it through their internal team.</li><li><strong>Real-time users.</strong> In this case, developers hire a team of unbiased users who test the app and report their problems and concerns. With them, you can also predict how certain elements will influence the behavior of different user groups.</li><li><strong>Automated tools.</strong> A development team creates special tools that provide statistics based on the overall performance of the app and user satisfaction. There are many helpful tools to perform this task. For instance, one may employ special facilitators to interact with people using the app or instruments providing you with the data based on eye and mouse movements, tracking, and heatmap methods. One can also use different types of surveys and polls.</li></ul><p>After collecting the necessary data through any of these means, the development team can explore ways to improve the app’s usability and responsiveness.</p><h3>Performance testing</h3><p>This type of testing is necessary, in order to check the performance capabilities of the app while in use. It’s highly probable that your application will have to pass through different device challenges, which may include low battery power, changing Internet connection types (2G, 3G, or WiFi), transferring massive files, shortage of memory, etc. In the focus of performance examination there are usually application’s speed, scalability, and stability.</p><p>The most common types of it are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Capacity testing</strong> – a process, which is used to determine how many users and actions the program will support without any breaks in its work. During evaluation, such resources as processor capacity, network bandwidth, memory usage, and disk capacity are checked and corrected to meet the needs of the audience.</li><li><strong>Stress testing</strong> – a process that involves checking the app’s work under extreme conditions to see how it manages heavy traffic and data processing.</li><li><strong>Scalability testing</strong> – a procedure which helps developers estimate the software’s effectiveness and develop its capacity in such dimensions as fast location based searches and minimization of the network usage.</li></ul><p>Without conducting performance check, your app may suffer from such problems as running slow while several users use it simultaneously, or various discrepancies while using it on different OS.</p><h3>Compatibility testing</h3><p>This type of mobile app testing is inevitable these days, as people tend to run the same programs on many devices. It helps you estimate your app’s capacities on different browsers, screen sizes, and OS versions.</p><p>With the help of compatibility tests, you will see (and solve) all the possible problems that may occur when the same app is run on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. These may even come up on iPhone and iPad versions of the same program! To avoid this, one should perform compatibility check on all possible devices and OS, or on the appropriate emulators.</p><h3>Security testing</h3><p>Nowadays, even the simplest applications on your smartphone require a great deal of data storage, which helps them perform their tasks more quickly; however, most of this includes your personal information, which must be kept secure. To test the capacity of an app’s information system to protect user data, one should perform security check.</p><p>This is a process that shows you if the confidential data will stay secure, and confirms that users are only performing those actions they are authorized to. In order to understand this, a massive examination of all roles and rights ought to be run. According to Statista, security was estimated to be one of the most important areas of testing, as a massive check of all roles and rights ought to be run before launching any app. Usually, several different user accounts with multiple roles and access abilities are created for that purpose. Security check includes tests for password quality, default logins, logout functionality, security questions and answers, encryption of sensitive data, etc.</p><h3>Testing strategies</h3><p>There are a bunch of various strategies developers can use to perform the above-mentioned steps. First of all, you can run them on emulators, although some experts don’t support this kind of app testing. Sometimes, however, this is the only available means, which can save lots of efforts and time for evaluating apps on actual devices, OS, and browsers with different configurations. So, emulators may really help both while developing and assessing the app; however, it is more efficient to involve actual gadgets and perform effective testing strategies on them (for example, A/B check).</p><p>This is a rather cheap and simple strategy, the only drawback being that it may be quite time-consuming, though we know it’s worth it when you see how great your app can look in the play stores, right? Analyze the traffic, feedback, and performance of different versions of your program’s functions and you’ll see that there is always room for improvement!</p><p>In this article, we offer you a list of testing tools for mobile apps, which are the most effective, according to the criteria we have mentioned above. We …</p></div></article></div>

<p>After few month of positive signs, there seems to be a slowdown in November, with many countries re-introducing lockdowns because of COVID.</p>



<p>In November, Lime continued to hold the top spot in App Store user ratings (4.88/5), among all micromobility companies. Bird and Voi hold the second and third spot with 4.84 and 4.83 respectively. Change in overall satisfaction remained stable similar to previous months, with Dott and India based Yulu improving their ratings by 1.6% and 1.3% respectively while Bird and Wind dropped by 0.1% and 0.2%.</p>



<p>Industry average improved by 0.02, from 4.79 to 4.81 out of 5.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Micromobility Industry average App Store rating: 4.81/5</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>In the newly opened UK market, Voi and Lime are the top rated (4.9/5) followed by Tier (4.8/5).</p>



<p>The total number of app store reviews were down by 35% compared to September numbers. Beam saw the biggest growth in activity (42%) while SKIP dropped by 82%</p>



<p>Overall five operators, Lime, Bird, Spin, Grin, and Voi, accounted for more than 90% of all international app store reviews last month. Lime had the highest number of ratings (56.8%).</p>



<p>Lime was also the most-reviewed app in several key markets, including the US, Italy and Germany. Voi saw the highest review activity in its home country, Sweden with a massive lead of 55.6% compared to Tier’s 22.2%) and Voi also lead in the UK (72.5%). In France, Dott saw the highest activity (46.2%) followed by Lime (30.8%). </p>

<p>In November, the number of App Store reviews were a bit below January levels for most of the tracked operators due to COVID19 linked lockdowns across the globe. Total number of reviews of Beam and Tier were up 381% and 163%, compared to their January baselines. Lime’s total reviews have been steadily recovering from April bottom, closing November at 24% below its January benchmark. Grin’s app store reviews are still down by 98%, ending last in the list. Grin will continue to stay at these levels until there is significant improvement in the current COVID19 situation in South America. </p>







<p>Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a scoring system for quantifying customer loyalty. Companies generally calculate NPS by asking customers to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar manner, App Stores ask their users to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5.</p>



<p>Typically, on a 0 to 10, those who respond 9 or 10 are considered “promoters,” or enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others; those who respond 7-8 are considered “passives,” customers who are satisfied but not overly enthusiastic; and those who respond 6 or less are considered “detractors,” or unhappy customers who could hurt the brand through negative reviews.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To calculate NPS for the scooter apps, I applied the following method, trying to replicate the classic scoring system.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Promoters (5)</li><li>Passives (4)</li><li>Detractors (1-3)</li></ul>

<p>In November, Lime continued to retain the top spot with a NPS score of 91.69, followed by Bird (89.98) and Voi (88.12).</p>



<p>Although Lime ranked the best globally, in some key European markets, local players scored higher in customer experience. In some of the largest markets in Europe like Germany and France and Italy, Voi had a higher NPS than Lime. On the contrary, in Sweden, both Bird and Lime scored higher than their European rivals. Lime led in the U.S (94), Spain (88), Portugal (90), New Zealand (92), South Korea (87) as well as Australia (93). Both in Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, smaller rival Beam is closing in on Lime with an NPS score of 92, 84 and 91 respectively. In UK, Lime and Voi took the top spot (92), followed by Tier (88).</p>

<p><strong>App Issue – 41%:&nbsp;</strong>Similar to the previous months, issues with the apps were the most reported, but stayed the same in percentage as October. Users reported trouble with signup, payment setup and annoying notifications among other things. Here are some of illustrative or interesting user comments:</p>



<p>Lime recently pushed out an update with a Dark UI and some users are confused! </p>



<pre>This app seems stuck on a dark screen (theme) with button options missing, phone is not on dark mode either, so is not useable at all, this started recently, is it my phone or the app???</pre>



<p>With operators adding an additional layer of Driving License verification, it adds additional points of failure in the onboarding flow. Normally, these verifications are not instant and can take anywhere from few seconds to a few minutes. Here is a comment from a SPIN user:</p>



<pre>Could not confirm my drivers license which is fine and kept having processing icon spinning for long periods of time for multiple verifications screens I had to go and use another inc scooter nearby.</pre>



<p>Voi had the most number of negative comments on Driving License verification:</p>



<pre>Have to have a drivers licence. Do you need a licence to ride a bike or a skateboard on the road? No. So why this. Response to developer reply: no i downloaded the app, added payment details, walked to a scooter, then it told me.</pre>



<pre>the camera function in the app keeps passing on 'unclear' versions of photos of my driver's license through to the voi office for verification... even though they look absolutely crystal clear on my phone (daylight photo with no reflections). such a shame as I really approve of the e-scooter method of public transport in Liverpool. I've used the Lime e-scooters in Frankfurt and had a much better/streamline experience.</pre>



<p>Tier users reported verification issues as well:</p>



<pre>They never verified my driving licence even after 3 weeks</pre>



<p>And… Wind:</p>



<pre>The team of WIND is pathetic.. for them Indian Driving Licence is not valid.. but they have provided the option of India to choose.. how moron they are.. and if they dont get what they want they will ban you and your number.. if I had chance I would have given them minus rating !.. infact the tele. Team also dont respond</pre>



<p>At this rate of move towards having only users with a valid Driving license, very soon, e-scooters won’t be available for many users, especially those who don’t have a Driving License and rely on bikes, public transit and e-scooters.</p>



<p><strong>Scooter Issue – 19%:</strong>&nbsp;The percentage of hardware problems reported by users increased from 16% in October to 19% in November.</p>



<p>Here are some comments from users:</p>



<pre>Total rip-off I went down hill scooter became unresponsive. Did not have time to push up hill to get it to work. They keept charging me would not stop They charged me $40</pre>



<p>A Neuron Mobility user reported inconsistent scooter behaviour in restricted zones:</p>



<pre>Scooter kept going into slow mode when I wasn't in the slow area, but then even in the no riding zone went fast. Then told me to turn around as I was leaving the service area, I turned around but it was still in limp mode and wouldn't go at all. Then when i checked the map.i wasnt even leaving the service area. Absolutely useless around central townsville. Don't know about elsewhere but I'll stick with lime...</pre>



<p>A Dott user reported injury after unexpected acceleration of the scooter:</p>



<pre>Technical issue at the first use : sudden acceleration that threw me into the air, now I have 1 twisted shoulder, and 2 twisted fingers. Plus it is very expensive compared to some other same scooters. Although I was very excited about using this app, I'm never coming back and would advise you to buy your own scooter instead of renting it. All in all it'll cost the same if not cheaper and you will know the machine you're riding, and its possible technical issues.</pre>



<p>A scooter user of  India based Yulu scooters reported error in battery status and stopping in a busy road:</p>



<pre>Pathetic experience. Bikes shows 100% battery but stops in between the rides suddenly saying battery low. I really felt dangerous to use this again as it stops suddenly at middle of the road and you can't even push the bike as the tyre gets locked and won't rotate. This happened not jus once but multiple times. Imagine how I would have felt when It broke down near Silkboard signal, felt very embarrassing dealing with it on busy road.</pre>



<p><strong>Overcharging – 14%:</strong>&nbsp;Overcharging by operators was the second most commonly reported issue in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did Lime solve the day pass issue yet? Though the number of negative comments have come down,  the issues is not fully solved:</p>



<pre>Total ripoff! Paid for the day pass for $15 and rode around DC for about 2 hours. Then it shut down on it's own with 50% battery left. Then like charged my PayPal almost $91 for the trip. I emailed my concern 12 days ago with no response. What a con job!</pre>



<p>Disadvantages of having distance based billing. How do you make sure that the distance measurement is correctly calibrated? Here a Yulu user was charged for 32km when in reality it was only 10km:</p>



<pre>I have worst experience . I have used 10km . But in this app showed 32km run by me. Please solve this issue . I have overcharged . Worst app</pre>



<p>Bird seems to have issues with Promos:</p>



<pre>I got a promo that literally says free rides on the app and it charged me $45 talked to a representative after getting off the phone they had charged me another $21. What is going with this company???</pre>



<p><strong>Customer Support, Cost – 19%:&nbsp;</strong>More people found the service expensive in November compared to previous months. Here are some of the comments:</p>



<pre>So I can get a bike with Lime for 2.5 kroner per minute or I can get a Mercedes with Share Now for 2 kroner per minute. And the luxury car doesn't come with an extortionate 'unlocking' fee. …</pre></div></div>

<p><em>This is a preliminary analysis of the SolarWinds Orion supply-chain nation-state attack. This is an ongoing analysis and more information will be published when available.</em></p>



<p>UPDATE 2020-12-19 23:20 UTC: updated results table</p>



<blockquote><p>This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that <strong>not only </strong>had the SUNBURST backdoor installed, but were also <strong>specifically targeted </strong>by the threat actor for <strong>the second stage of the attack</strong>, where <strong>further internal compromise </strong>likely took place.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyberattack that is one of the most severe in history.</p>



<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to potentially 18.000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.</p>



<p>The infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe the threat actor systems to request instructions.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to determine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor <strong>explicitly selected for further activities</strong>, where it is likely that further internal compromise took place.</p>



<p>While this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the type of organizations that were the real targets of the attack.</p>



<p>Some names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (<strong>Cisco GGSG</strong>), us.deloitte.co (<strong>Deloitte</strong>), nswhealth.net (<strong>NSW Ministry of Health in Australia</strong>), <strong>banccentral.com</strong> (service supplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.</p>



<p>Based on the decoded internal names of the victims, there are also indications that <strong>Mediatek</strong>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest semiconductors provider for mobile phones globally, was explicitly targeted by the threat actor. This is not confirmed at this point, but if confirmed it would have massive consequences globally.</p>



<p>The impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted parts of the intelligence community.</p>







<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds to deliver malicious software updates to their customers (approximately 18.000 potentially affected customers according to SolarWinds). The update installed a sophisticated backdoor giving the threat actor the ability to access selected targets and proceed with further activities inside the compromised organizations.</p>



<p>It is believed that the attack was carried out by a nation-state actor, likely APT29 a.k.a. Cozy Bear, i.e. Russian Intelligence.</p>



<p>FireEye and Microsoft initially published reports<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[1]</a><a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[2]</a> describing some of the inner workings of the backdoor. The backdoor is remarkably sophisticated and is worth a long technical description, while only some of its functionalities and characteristics are described in this article.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analysed the backdoor as well as historical network data to identify patterns revealing possible victims.</p>



<p>Due to the nature of the attack, a large number of organizations around the world have been affected by the backdoor, while likely only a smaller number were specifically selected and targeted by the threat actor to conduct additional internal compromise (phase 2).</p>



<p>This report presents some of the identified targets that were <strong>specifically targeted for phase 2</strong>.<br></p>







<p>The threat actor was able to inject a backdoor in the Solarwinds Orion software by modifying the source code of an existing plugin, which was then signed by Solarwinds and published as part of an update available on the SolarWinds website. SolarWinds published an advisory<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory" target="_blank">[3]</a> specifying the versions affected.</p>



<p>The malicious update has been available for several months and there are indications of breaches as early as March 2020. One of the identified malicious updates was hosted at the following URL:</p>



<pre>hxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp</pre>



<p>The update package was properly digitally-signed, as shown below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="511" height="657" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-update-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-update-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png 511w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-update-backdoor-sunburst-certificate-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px"><figcaption>Figure 1 – Malicious Solarwinds Orion update containing backdoor</figcaption></figure>



<p>The backdoor code was made part of the following digitally-signed Orion component:</p>



<pre>SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll</pre>



<p>This DLL is also signed.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="465" height="660" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png 465w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate-211x300.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"><figcaption>Figure 2 – Malicious Solarwinds Orion DLL containing backdoor</figcaption></figure>



<p>The backdoor implements sophisticated functionality to communicate with the threat actor infrastructure and applies logic to determine what actions should be taken.</p>



<p>As a large number of Orion servers around the world have been infected with the backdoor, the threat actor had to have a way to determine which organization was contacting the attack infrastructure to be able to select the real target of this attack. This logic is explained below.</p>



<p>The hacked servers that received the Solarwinds backdoor periodically probe the threat actor infrastructure with a DNS query like the following:</p>



<pre>&lt;DGA_value&gt;.appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com</pre>



<p>where &lt;DGA_value&gt; is computed with a DomainName Generation Algorithm and contains an encoded version of the internal Active Directory name of the infected server. The threat actor server decodes the information in the DNS requests and uses the internal domain name of the organization to determine what instructions to send back.</p>



<p>Truesec reversed the backdoor and identified a set of IP address ranges that, when received as part of the DNS response, will determine the actions taken by the backdoor code. Part of this code is illustrated in the figure below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="769" height="523" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers.png" alt="Solarwinds sunburst backdoor reversed showing IP ranges used to determine next actions" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers.png 769w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px"><figcaption>Figure 3 – Reversed backdoor showing IP ranges used to determine next actions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>AddressFamily</strong> field determines the type of operation as described below.</p>



<p><strong>Atm or ImpLink</strong> : enumerates processes and services.</p>



<p><strong>Ipx</strong> : update local “Status” configuration.</p>



<p><strong>NetBios</strong>: initializes an HTTP backdoor channel used to collect additional information and deploy a second stage malware (specified by the threat actor at the time of instructions, and therefore specific to the target).</p>



<p>We can therefore assume that if the initial probe was answered with an address of type <strong>NetBios</strong>, the threat actor explicitly took action to deploy a second stage to the affected organization, and most likely performed additional internal compromise.</p>







<p>The DomainName Generation Algorithm described earlier, used to create a DNS query containing an encoded value of the internal domain name of the compromised organization, can be reversed.</p>



<p>RedDrip Team published a report<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/v-ekPFtVNZG1W7vWjcuVug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[4]</a> and a script<a href="https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[5]</a> to decode the DGA part of the DNS requests, therefore allowing to retrieve the cleartext value of the internal domain name of the hacked server that made the request.</p>



<p>For example, if a compromised server makes the following request to the threat actor server:</p>



<pre>ciepcqqog816s6urtt6t0kf60ceo6e20.appsync-api.us-east-2.avsvmcloud[.]com</pre>



<p>This can be decoded to obtain the following internal name of the victim:</p>



<pre>ggsg-us.cisco</pre>



<p>This means that having records of performed DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com will reveal the internal names of the compromised organizations.</p>







<p>The next step was to obtain historical records of DNS requests, <strong>including the response</strong>. We obtained some of the available historical data<a href="https://github.com/bambenek/research/tree/main/sunburst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6]</a> (as we find more data we will publish updates).</p>



<p>The sample data contains 1528 DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com and their responses.</p>



<p>When filtered for requests matching the DGA algorithm syntax, we have requests with dates ranging from early April to December 2020.</p>



<p>This is an example of such request and response:</p>



<pre>date : 2020-04-19 08:24:26
last_seen : 2020-04-19 08:24:27
qtype : 1
domain : avsvmcloud.com
qname : q8bps26mocuq6re4dutru70ct2w.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud.com
value_ip : 8.18.144.138
type : ip
_key : 0e8ab64d5f5aff04fea862f4f72fcf1d04c3d377
value : 8.18.144.138</pre>



<p>From this data we can determine that on April 19<sup>th</sup>, a request was made that decodes to the internal name <strong>pageaz.gov</strong>, and received as response 8.18.144.138, which according to the backdoor logic explained earlier maps to address type <strong>NetBios</strong>, meaning that the threat actor attempted to deploy an HTTP backdoor in this environment.</p>







<p>By analysing the IP addresses returned when instructing infected servers to establish an HTTP backdoor, we can identify where the threat actor directed their victims.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>IP block</strong></td><td><strong>Registered Organization (WHOIS information)</strong><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td>184.72.0.0 / 255.254.0.0</td><td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>71.152.53.0 / 255.255.255.0</td><td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>8.18.144.0 / 255.255.254.0</td><td>Amazon Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>87.238.80.0 / 255.255.248.0</td><td>Amazon Data Services Ireland DUB3 Datacentre</td></tr><tr><td>18.130.0.0 / 255.255.0.0</td><td>Amazon Technologies Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>99.79.0.0 / 255.255.0.0</td><td>Amazon Data Services Canada</td></tr><tr><td>199.201.117.0 / 255.255.255.0</td><td>Traiana, Inc</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Table 1 – List of IP blocks used when instructing systems to establish an HTTP backdoor, mapped to WHOIS information</figcaption></figure>



<p>Almost all IP blocks are part of Amazon infrastructure. This makes sense as threat actors often use cloud providers to host their attack infrastructure.</p>



<p>However there is one block that sticks out, as it is registered to <strong>Traiana, Inc</strong>.</p>

<p><em>This is a preliminary analysis of the SolarWinds Orion supply-chain nation-state attack. This is an ongoing analysis and more information will be published when available.</em></p>



<p>UPDATE 2020-12-19 23:20 UTC: updated results table</p>



<blockquote><p>This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that <strong>not only </strong>had the SUNBURST backdoor installed, but were also <strong>specifically targeted </strong>by the threat actor for <strong>the second stage of the attack</strong>, where <strong>further internal compromise </strong>likely took place.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyberattack that is one of the most severe in history.</p>



<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to potentially 18.000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.</p>



<p>The infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe the threat actor systems to request instructions.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to determine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor <strong>explicitly selected for further activities</strong>, where it is likely that further internal compromise took place.</p>



<p>While this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the type of organizations that were the real targets of the attack.</p>



<p>Some names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (<strong>Cisco GGSG</strong>), us.deloitte.co (<strong>Deloitte</strong>), nswhealth.net (<strong>NSW Ministry of Health in Australia</strong>), <strong>banccentral.com</strong> (service supplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.</p>



<p>Based on the decoded internal names of the victims, there are also indications that <strong>Mediatek</strong>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest semiconductors provider for mobile phones globally, was explicitly targeted by the threat actor. This is not confirmed at this point, but if confirmed it would have massive consequences globally.</p>



<p>The impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted parts of the intelligence community.</p>

They are experiments. They do work, and are being used in practice in the organizations that originated the forks. But they are not architecturally suitable for a large-scale mutual coordination economy. Architecturally, they are platforms: that is, all of the participants use the same code, the same server, and the same database.</span></p><h3 id="h.eap2q8rloned"><span>Next stage</span></h3><p><span>The next stage of experiments from the same people who have been developing the proofs of concept involves refactoring those systems into smaller components which can be deployed on decentralized infrastructures. While the components could be used on blockchains, we do not consider those to be either decentralized or flexible enough for the coming requirements, which we think will involve many agents of many kinds, both individuals and organizations, all over the world, in many domains, and need creative contributions from many people who need to be able to act independently and still be able to interoperate. </span><span>Blockchains are like platforms to the extent that </span><span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/357/does-every-node-execute-the-contract-code-for-each-transaction&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1566247136826000">all of the participants use the same code and the same logical blockchain</a></span><span>, although the chain may have many replicants.</span></p><p><span>So we think that future needs to be built on vocabularies and protocols instead of platforms, even cooperative platforms.

December 18, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/18 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/18">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><h2>How it all began</h2>
<p>I'm a huge proponent of Capture The Flag competitions, and I've been involved in the CTF scene since my university days. Lucky for me, there was a CTF club at the University of Oslo. I've always been curious about hacking and the club quickly caught my attention. The club formerly known as UiO CTF (now Oslo CTF) organized workshops and competitions. Soon enough I was a dedicated member of the group and was heavily involved in organizing both competitions and workshops. One of my fondest memories is when we hosted an on-campus CTF with over 80 attendees, and we called a large Norwegian pizza restaurant chain requesting pizza for 80 people. The pizza place wasn't too happy, but they delivered while the head of the security department's jaw dropped when figured out that the department had to pay for 80 peoples worth of pizza. We had an absolute blast.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p> of the CTF Club
Hosting a CTF is a challenge in itself, infrastructure is hard. Especially while being an inexperienced student. The hosting infrastructure has gone through a few revisions during my time with the club. It started out very manual. Spinning up a virtual machine and deploying every task individually, configuring certificates manually with nginx. Everything hosted using the free credits you get, when signing up for a Google Cloud Platform account. It worked, but it was a pain. The next evolution of the platform was the use of containers. Every task had its own container, and it made starting the challenges easier. My friend ended up writing a bash script for starting everything. We finally had some degree of automation, and we kept working on the platform. More and more scripts were written. We had a script for pulling the challenges from GitHub, one for starting everything, and another for modifying nginx configurations files to set up TLS certificates and subdomains, and another for setting up <a href="https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd">CTFd</a>. In the end, we ended up with a hack job of epic proportions which consisted of several python and bash scripts. It was getting out of hand, and it became excruciatingly unmaintainable, but it did the job.</p>
<h2>Still in the game</h2>
<p>I graduated with a master’s degree in Computer Science with a heavy focus on Information Security and remained involved with the CTF club post-graduation. Real life awaited me and joined Bekk as a consultant in 2019. Soon enough I became involved with the security group at Bekk. The new direction of the security group was to improve security skills and knowledge through the use of CTF-challenges and wargames. The timing could not have been better, and I felt that I could bring something valuable to the group as a whole given my CTF experience. The security group also provides internal and external services. Security consulting, workshops, and so on.</p>
<h2>The Pandemic</h2>
<p>Covid19 hit like a brick, chaos emerged, the S&amp;P 500 tanked, and the Bekk recruitment apparatus had to pivot quickly in order. Company presentations at universities and colleges were no longer possible, thus emerged project Pangea. The goal was an online platform consisting of multiple presentations, articles, activities, and competitions. Every part of Bekk was encouraged to contribute, and I got a request for organizing a CTF. I was excited, and I grossly underestimated the time and effort needed to pull it all together. I could have just reused the stuff we had made during the time at Oslo-CTF, but it didn't feel right, since I didn't technically own it, so I started working on my own infrastructure. Oh boy, how I grossly underestimated the time and effort needed to pull this thing off.</p>
<h2>Chasing clouds</h2>
<p>I dug out a few tasks I had made in the past and started working on quite a few new ones. This was the "easy" part, the challenge was the infrastructure. As I was comfortable with Google Cloud Platform, I picked GCP as my cloud provider. The first thing I looked at was Google Cloud Run, a really neat serverless service. Dockerize the challenge, deploy, and only pay when the container is processing incoming and outgoing traffic. It seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately, it was. I had this odd edge case, where quite a few challenges required interaction over raw TCP. The problem was that Cloud Run requires apps that communicate over HTTP, so back to the drawing board I went. The next obvious choice was Google Compute Engine, a virtual machine.</p>
<h2>Automation Nation</h2>
<p>Since every challenge was a docker container, in addition to there being a docker image for CTFd I ended up putting it all into a docker-compose file. Now I could easily start every challenge rapidly, but I still had the issue of setting up subdomains and TLS certificates. I had used nginx in the past, but as I started configuring, I soon realized that it would be far too tedious to do manually. There had to be a better way, and there was.
After some intense research, I discovered Traefik. Traefik was a total game-changer, if only we had known about this back in my university days. It could do subdomains, service discovery, certificates, and routing. Again, it seemed almost too good to be true, but luckily for me, this time it turned out to be to be the missing piece to the puzzle.</p>
<h2>The Missing Piece</h2>
<p>Traefik was a little finicky to begin with, with their documentation was somewhat lacking in examples. Especially when it came to the business of issuing certificates. I wanted to issue a wild card certificate, but there weren't good any examples in the documentation on how to do this. Secondly, my domain provider didn't even support wild card certs in with their DNS service. Cloudflare came to the rescue. It was free, and very straight forward to set up. Quite a few StackOverflow threads later, I finally figured out how to accomplish what I wanted to achieve. This was the final piece of my infrastructure puzzle. Traefik, CTFd, and the challenges all bundled together in a docker-compose file. One <code>docker-compose up -d</code> later, and I was good to go. All though I did mess things up by repeatedly deleting a folder containing certificates causing my infrastructure to request way too many certs from Let's Encrypt and having to change the subdomains of multiple challenges, it was overall a great success. I managed to pull it all together before the deadline. Hours of hard work and research finally paid off. The CTF was a success and ran without any major hiccups.</p>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>My new platform is by no means perfect, and there are some things I wish were different. Like having a proper CI/CD pipeline for deploying the challenges. I don't think my setup will scale very well, and I wish to introduce proper container orchestration with Kubernetes in the future. At least it fits my current needs and is way more modular and reusable than it has ever been. I've put down hours and hours of work, and I have learned so much about so many new things throughout the whole process. It has ultimately been a rewarding experience. This may not be the best way to host a CTF. I don't even know if it a good way to host CTF, but this has been how I host a CTF.</p>
<h2>Onwards and upwards!</h2>
<p>I started out with a total mess and ended up with something I can live with, and it suits my current needs. It's easy to set up, and it does the job. Hopefully, this may be of some use if you ever plan on host a CTF for your friends, colleagues, or CTF club. There are several improvements to be made, and I'll keep hacking at it when I find the time. The dream is to build a platform that can be set up with a click in a matter of seconds at the click of a button, but there's a long way to go, and a bumpy road ahead. The current rig probably won't survive over 9000 hackers, but it has survived 30 hackers with great ease. </p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3746231">Pancs (2020)</a> proposes an auction for vaccines in which people can bid on others’ behalf.
This format allows people to internalize the externalities they enjoy from their peers being vaccinated.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there are two vaccines to be allocated among agents A–H, who are connected socially via the network shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://bldavies.com/blog/auctioning-vaccines/figures/network-1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Everyone submits bids totaling $60, spread evenly among themselves and their peers.
For example, agent A bids $30 towards vaccinating themself and agent B, while agent B bids $15 towards vaccinating themself and agents A, C, and D.
Intuitively, agent A values vaccinating B highly because it protects A fully from viruses transmitted among agents C–H.
In contrast, B has more peers and so values vaccinating any one of those peers less because it doesn’t protect B fully from the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The “aggregate bid” for each agent equals the sum of bids submitted towards that agent’s vaccination.
The agents with the highest aggregate bids receive the vaccines.
In this example, agents B and F receive the vaccine, with aggregate bids equal to $94 and $87.</p>
<p>Each agent receives surplus equal to their subjective valuation of the vaccine allocation minus their payment towards that allocation’s provision.
This payment equals the increase in aggregate surplus that other agents would receive if the agent’s bids were ignored.
Thus, the vaccine auction is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction">Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction</a> in which each agent pays the harm they inflict on other agents.
Consequently, the vaccine auction inherits the properties of VCG auctions; in particular, bids equal subjective valuations.
This property makes it easy to compute pre-payment surpluses: simply sum each agent’s bids towards vaccinated agents.</p>
<p>The table below presents the aggregate bid for, payment made by, and surplus delivered to each agent under the optimal vaccine allocation.
Agents B and F don’t have to pay for the vaccines they receive because others are willing to pay on their behalf.
Agent A pays $15 because their bid towards vaccinating B shifts the optimal allocation away from E, which lowers F’s surplus by $15.
Likewise, agents G and H pay because their preference to vaccinate F, rather than E, makes B–D worse off.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Agent</th>
<th>Aggregate bid ($)</th>
<th>Payment ($)</th>
<th>Surplus ($)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>42</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>94</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>79</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>87</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td>45</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td>
<td>45</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This example departs from reality in two important ways.
First, I assume each agent’s bids sum to a constant ($60).
This assumption is obviously unrealistic: wealth inequality means some people can afford to submit higher bids than others, which may lead to inequitible vaccine allocations.
Moreover, people may vary in their willingness to pay for vaccines independently of the variation in their wealths.</p>
<p>Second, I assume every agent wants to be vaccinated.
This common desire may not hold in reality: some people may prefer not to be vaccinated because they fear potential side-effects.
Such people may refuse to participate in the auction, reducing social welfare by preventing some externalities from being internalized.</p>

    </span></p><p>Over time, you get a clear picture of your personal keyboard usage. Are there any far-away keys that are red (i.e, get used a lot)? Are there any easily-accessible keys that are being wasted?</p>
<p>For my own use, shown above, we can see that I could be putting the thumb cluster for my left hand to much better use. On the main cluster, we can see the Colemak keyboard layout at work, with the home row being used heavily (as it should be).</p>
<h3>How long should a session be?</h3>
<p>To get a clear picture of your typing habits, you could do one of two things:</p>
<p><strong>Wait for Oryx to go “ding”.</strong> When Oryx feels like there’s enough data on your typing habits, it will sound an audible ding, inviting you to check out the tab and see how you’re doing.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also…</p>
<p><strong>Go by activity.</strong> This is actually my preferred way of doing it. My typing pattern tends to change according to whatever I’m currently doing: Editing images isn’t like replying to email, and my keyboard usage patterns reflect this.</p>
<p>So what I like to do is turn on the heat map, and sink into <em>one</em> kind of deep work for a while. Maybe writing, or email, or coding — whatever. Then, when I’m done with that particular activity, I go and check on my heat map. I also take a moment to pay attention to my body: How do my hands, arms, and shoulders feel right now?</p>
<p>This particular context — the physical state and heat map that result from <em>this</em> work — can be a powerful source of information for further optimizing my layout.</p>
<p>Questions I like to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any wasted keys I should reassign? Specifically, are there any keys I didn’t use at all?</li>
<li>Does the heat map show one hand working much harder than the other? Does it feel that way in my body, too?</li>
<li>Are any far-away keys red?</li>
<li>Should I create a dedicated layer just for this one application or use case? I.e, when I do this activity, am I mainly using keys on the outside edges of the keyboard, or “reaching” a lot?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a few sessions with the heat map feature, followed by iterating on your layout, can result in powerful (and highly personalized) ergonomic gains. Try it out!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<li><p><strong>It is easier to say what not to do, than to do what is needed.</strong>
So do not be discouraged by this list; you, too, have something to contribute.</p></li>
<li><p><strong id="tradeoffs">Every decision that matters is a tradeoff.</strong>
There never was, and never will be, a perfect language.
As humans have many purposes, so must programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p>The measure of a language is not what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">possible</a> in it, but <strong>what it makes easy.</strong>
<!-- 1. What is *possible* in a language matters less than what is *easy*. -->
<!-- 1. Languages are defined more by what they make easy than by what they make possible. --></p></li>
<li><p>Thus, a language's strongest characteristic is what it makes <em>automatic</em>:
What <em>don't</em> you have to think about when using this language?
<!-- 1. *Corollary:* What is possible in a language matters less than what it makes *automatic*. -->
<!-- 1. ? What your language makes easy is less important than what it makes automatic.
!--
!-- 1. What your language makes automatic is just the opposite of what it makes impossible. --></p></li>
<li><p>There is power in restraint. The less a language does, the more can be done
<em>to</em> it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/rg9119/status/774383048183783424">Types are a tool of thought.</a></strong>
They exist in the mind first, and in the machine second.</p>

<p>A statically typed language, therefore, guides your thinking. This is useful.
<br>A dynamically typed language lets you think freely. This too is useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Shorten the edit-compile-run cycle. Then shorten it some more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong id="readability">Readability beats writeability.</strong> Or,
<em>predictability beats convenience</em>.</p>

<p>It is better that code be transparent to read than convenient to write. This
is less important for one-shot scripts, and more important for large
codebases tended by many people.</p>

<!-- Explorations of this idea: regularity in language design. many operations on one data structure vs few operations on many data structures? --></li>
<li><p><strong>Brevity is good, until it's bad.</strong></p>

<p>Brevity both helps and harms readability. You can only fit so much in your
head at one time. Terse notation helps more fit in; it aids in reading and
recognizing patterns. But it also steepens the learning curve and increases
memory load.</p>

<p>Notations must be <em>justified</em> by frequency of use and
<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm">power of thought gained</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em id="low-level">A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.</em> <br><small><cite>— <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html">Alan Perlis</a></cite></small>
<!-- 1. *A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.* <br><small><cite>&mdash; <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html">Alan Perlis</a></cite></small> --></p>

<p>This is, of course, a relative condition: Irrelevant to what? Irrelevant to whom?
We often think of languages as being lower- or higher-level than other languages. Actually, they're <em>below</em> or <em>above</em> certain <em>concerns</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explicitness is good, until it's bad.</strong></p>

<p>Explicitness is good when it <em><a href="#readability">prioritizes readability over writeability</a></em>.
<br>
Explicitness is bad when it <em><a href="#low-level">requires attention to the irrelevant</a></em>.</p>

<p>Can't it do both? <a href="#tradeoffs">Of course it can!</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not everything is an object.</strong> Nor is everything a function, a string, a
process, an actor, a value, a thunk, a message, a list, a file, or
<a href="http://www.rntz.net/post/2016-06-06-not-everything-is-an-expression.html">an expression</a>. Not everything is data, nor is everything code. Not
everything is lazy, immutable, pure, copyable, serializable, sortable, or
transmissible over the network. <code>goto</code> is not the only control operator, and
<a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/against-callcc.html">neither is <code>call/cc</code></a>.</p>

!--   The world is a messy place, and programming is messy too. Cramming all of programming into one concept never works. ([Except][lambda-calc] [in][pi-calc] [theory][sk-calc].) --></li>

<strong><a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/11/extremist-programming/">taking things to extremes</a></strong>
do we truly learn their limits.
<!-- Everything is clearest in the extreme. --></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html">Always bet on text.</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Yet long shots are worth taking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The medium matters.</strong> Consider how the programmer will interact with your
language or system. Will they use text files? a REPL? a shell? an IDE? a GUI?
a spreadsheet? a structure editor? a browser? The language design should
harmonize with the available methods of interaction. Indentation-sensitivity
is a terrible fit for a line-oriented interactive shell, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax matters less than you think.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax matters <a href="https://thefeedbackloop.xyz/stroustrups-rule-and-layering-over-time/">more than you think</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax is a pain in the ass.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance is a lot like syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>"<em>Declarative</em>" means you can use it without knowing what it's doing.</p>

<p>All too often, it means you can't <em>tell</em> what it's doing, either.</p></li>
<li><p>What applies to languages, applies to libraries. Consider, for example, how
<em>predictability beats convenience</em> might apply to the design of a numerical
library. <!-- Or how *the medium matters* applies to --></p></li>
<li><p>Performance matters. Syntax matters. Documentation matters. Libraries matter. Culture matters. First-mover advantage matters. Compatibility matters. Corporate support matters. Error messages matter.</p>

<p>But in the end, <strong>only two things are sure when it comes to language popularity:</strong></p>

<li><p>To succeed, be the only available option on a popular platform.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/samth/status/809764608802258944">Nobody likes parentheses</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Languages teach ways of approaching problems. Once you know the way, you
don't always need the language.</p>

<p>... but your friend might!</p></li>

    <h3>How Changing One Sentence led to 2.5x more Reviews</h3>
    
        <h6>December 17, 2020</h6>
    
    </p>
  </div><div>
    <div>
		<p><strong><u>June 2019</u></strong><br>
Fifteen years in business and we had a measly three reviews on Google.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>I reminded myself that this is <em>exactly</em> why I moved back from the Bay area to work on the family business – to use technology to expand. Let’s fix this!</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2020.12.17/2.stoneland-reviews-dec-2019.jpg" alt="Stoneland Reviews December 2020" width="60%"> 
</figure>

<p>I’d read somewhere that people are most willing to review right after their experience – good or bad.
I’d been itching to use Twilio, and this was the perfect use case!
Our inside sales person saves a visitor’s contact information right after a visitor leaves. Their phone number is included in this.</p>
<p>So, June 2019 I wrote a python script that sent an SMS to the visitor an 1 hour after they left. The SMS said:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit (or didn't), please let us know how we did!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl <br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>I thought it was pretty slick, getting the URL, a cohesive message and proper formatting into one SMS.</p>
<p>At the same time, our sales team made a push to get reviews by emailing old customers.</p>
<p><strong><u>December 2019</u></strong><br>
We have 18 reviews now! While a big improvement over the last 15 years, it was still far below our competition.
And most of the reviews were in September when our sales team made the push. Now the trickle had dried up.</p>
<p>I’d been reading and listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indiehackers</a>, especially interviews with founders who were marketing specialists. After ingesting Indiehacker nuggets, I settled on changing one factor at a time to understand what drove reviews.</p>
<p>In January 2020, I tweaked the copy of the SMS to read:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit, leave us a 5 second rating!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl<br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote></div></div>
<p><strong><u>December 2020</u></strong><br>
That tiny change made all the difference! As of December 15, 2020, we have <strong>93 reviews</strong> with a 4.9 rating!
We’ve outstripped all our competitors in the area, as well as several of our customers.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Copywriting matters.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>P.S. For anyone wondering about the math around ‘2.5x’, here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 2019 - December 2020 (~6 months): 15 reviews</li>
<li>Extrapolated over 12 months: 30 reviews</li>
<li>January 2020 - December 2020 (~12 months): 75 reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><span>75/30 = <strong>2.5</strong></span></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I didn’t learn about history very well prior to my thirties somehow, but lately I’ve been variously trying to rectify this. Lately I’ve been reading Howard Zinn’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2YH8EQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">People’s History of the United States</a>, listening to Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0670022950/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">the Better Angels of Our Nature</a>, watching Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/home/">documentary about the Vietnam War</a> and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Webzwithaz">Oversimplified</a> history videos on YouTube (which I find too lighthearted for the subject matter, but if you want to squeeze extra history learning in your leisure and dessert time, compromises can be worth it.)</p>

<p>There is a basic feature of all this that I’m perpetually confused about: how has there been so much energy for going to war?</p>

<p>It’s hard to explain my confusion, because in each particular case, there might be plenty of plausible motives given–someone wants ‘power’, or to ‘reunite their country’, or there is some customary enemy, or that enemy might attack them otherwise–but overall, it seems like the kind of thing people should be extremely averse to, such that even if there were plausibly good justifications, they wouldn’t just win out constantly, other justifications for not doing the thing would usually be found. Like, there are great reasons for writing epic treatises on abstract topics, but somehow, most people find that they don’t get around to it. I expect going to some huge effort to travel overseas and die in the mud to be more like that, intuitively.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not confused here about people fighting in defense of things they care a lot about—joining the army when their country is under attack, or joining the Allies in WWII. And I’m not confused by people who are forced to fight, by conscription or desperate need of money. It’s just that across these various sources on history, I haven’t seen much comprehensible-to-me explanation of what’s going on in the minds of the people who volunteer to go to war (or take part in smaller dangerous violence) when the stakes aren’t already at the life or death level for them.</p>

<p>I am also not criticizing the people whose motives I am confused by–I’m confident that I’m missing things.</p>

<p>It’s like if I woke up tomorrow to find that half the country was volunteering to cut off their little finger for charity, I’d be pretty surprised. And if upon inquiring, each person had something to say—about how it was a good charity, or how suffering is brave and valiant, or how their Dad did it already, or how they were being emotionally manipulated by someone else who wanted it to happen, or they how wanted to be part of something—each one might not be that unlikely, but I’d still feel overall super confused, at a high level, at there being enough total energy behind this, given that it’s a pretty costly thing to do.</p>

<p>At first glance, the historical people heading off to war don’t feel surprising. But I feel like this is because it is taken for granted as what historical people do. Just as in stories about Christmas, it is taken for granted that Santa Clause will make and distribute billions of toys, because that’s what he does, even though his motives are actually fairly opaque. But historical people presumably had internal lives that would be recognizable to me. What did it look like from the inside, to hear that WWI was starting, and hurry to sign up? Or to volunteer for the French military in time to fight to maintain French control in Vietnam, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Indochina_War">First Indochina War</a>, that preceded the Vietnam War?</p>

<p>I’d feel less surprised in a world where deadly conflict was more like cannibalism is in our world. Where yes, technically humans are edible, so if you are hungry enough you can eat them, but it is extremely rare for it to get to that, because nobody wants to be on any side of it, and they have very strong and consistent feelings about that, and if anyone really wanted to eat thousands or millions of people, say to bolster their personal or group power, it would be prohibitively expensive in terms of money or social capital to overcome the universal distaste for this idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Since I’ve been reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/i-am-error"><em>I Am Error</em></a>, I’ve been getting more and more interested in the technical aspects of the Famicom. Turns out all you really need to get me interested in your console is prose explanations of how a pattern table works. Also, I get to drip some molten lead into it so I can use a modern TV! Everyone wins.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, a lot of my friends had an NES, but I first had the ColecoVision and then a “Model 2” Sega Genesis when that came out. As a result, I’ve gone the last few decades thinking the NES was full of branded shovelware, because it turns out that’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzJ0M-erXAM">the exact kind of game that eight year old boys bought a lot of and then subjected their friends to</a>.</p>

<p>Later, when I was getting interested in collecting old videogames, the NES had already started its stratospheric price rise for many games, and with it the skeeziest members of the game-price-speculator community. None of the cool modern “community” stuff existed then (NESRGB, Everdrives, FDSStick) so I gave the entire system a wide berth and decided to wait until this whole fad was over and prices returned to normal. That hasn’t happened yet… however, in Japan, stuff is still really cheap due to the massive popularity of the Famicom, and the Famicom is different enough from the NES that I’m coming at it without the same preconceptions that I had of those childhood NESes.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the original Famicom only has RF output. If you’re not familiar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sQF_K9MqpA">this video by Gravis is the best I’ve seen on how RF output works</a>, and a Nintendo is even used to make it relevant to this post.</p>

<p>Not only does the Famicom only have RF output, the Japanese channel frequencies are such that that RF output only appears on channel 95 and 96 on a Western TV, which a lot of TVs simply can’t reach. On some models, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVyFEMg0Kpg">tweak the pots on the RF can to bring that down to US channel 6</a> to get around this. However, I wanted to play my games on a Commodore 1702 or a PVM, neither of which have an antenna tuner of any kind. Doing a composite mod seemed like the easiest way forward.</p>

<h2 id="giving-it-a-good-squint">Giving It A Good Squint</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that a Famicom is a <em>lot</em> smaller than an NES. They added a bunch of empty space for the American model in order to accommodate the “toaster” mechanism, I guess.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-vs-nes.jpg" alt="A Famicom is sitting on top of an American front-loading NES, which is a spoiled Western brat and doesn't like loading cartridges."></p>

<p>I thought I would hate the hard-wired controllers, but they’re actually really nice. You’re guaranteed to always get first-party controllers when you buy a used system, which is more than I can say for basically any other machine, that NES included. It would be nice if they were in better condition, but if they work I’ll be happy.</p>

<p>There’s a “Famicom Family” logo on the front sticker that I haven’t seen on most other Famicoms; from what I can tell, this is a good way to tell what machines are later models as it ties into <a href="https://maru-chang.com/hard/hvc/english.htm">some kind of later branding</a>.</p>

<h2 id="opening-it-up">Opening It Up</h2>
<p>When mine arrived from Japan, it looked dirty and pretty beaten up, but that’s okay for a test machine. I can always get a nicer one later; another thing to hoard.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-case-damage.jpg" alt="The missing chunk of plastic near the player 1 controller slot."></p>

<p>A corner of the plastic near the player-1 controller mount was missing, and there was grit in the textured plastic. I took a few trips to the sink with the plastic and scrubbed, but the yellowing is obviously not going to come out with soap and water.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-opened.jpg" alt="The Famicom's bottom cover is opened, revealing the underside of the motherboard."></p>

<p>I opened it up - screws were tight, a good sign - and then took a look at the board. It’s a late model, as evidenced by the big power/RF module soldered to the board instead of attached by a ribbon cable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-gross-pot.jpg" alt="There is a green potentiometer with some gunk and tree debris (seeds?) on it."></p>

<p>This console has spent some time in an old shed or something, based on how much of Mother Nature had crept inside of it, but at least I didn’t find any stray cigarettes inside it unlike the above NES. The motherboard cleaned up quickly with some spray alcohol and cotton swabs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-1989-copyright.jpg" alt="The copyright reads © 1989 Nintendo"></p>

<p>The board is a 1989, which was a pretty good year for Nintendo. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/07/time-to-feel-old-inside-the-nes-on-its-30th-birthday/3/">The Famicom apparently kept getting made until <em>2003</em></a>. It would be cool to track one of those down.</p>

<p>I wanted to deep-clean the dirty, scratched-up controllers as well - the controllers still had their protective plastic wrap on them, but they were scratched anyway! - and make sure that the silicone on the D-pads were in good shape, but I stripped one of the screws on controller 1 pretty severely in a moment of clumsiness. I’ll drill that out later and service it, but in the meantime let’s get back to the composite mod.</p>

<h2 id="motherboard-work">Motherboard Work</h2>
<p>I got sort of lucky in having a late-model board. On the later boards there’s a dedicated “video” pin that is broken out near the RF jack that I could just solder to, rather than lifting pin 21 (<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_pin_out_and_signal_description"><code>VOUT</code></a>) of the PPU. This way, you can keep both the RF and composite. Reportedly, this creates a bunch of ‘jailbar’ interference, so I’ve done what others have and lifted pin 21 of the PPU. Sometimes the hard way is the best way.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-pin21-lifted.jpg" alt="Pin 21 lifted out of the PPU. Ignore the Sharpie mark telling me which pin is 21, as if I could have forgotten"></p>

<p>This wasn’t too hard to desolder and lift, but the pin would have looked a lot less mangled if I had also desoldered R6 first to get it out of the way. I had to use a little bit too much force on my “prying tweezers” to lift it out, which could have easily broken the leg on a newer chip where the legs are much more fragile. Thanks, 80s technology!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-decoupling-caps.jpg" alt="The axial decoupling caps are added."></p>

<p>I also added decoupling caps between 5V and GND on the CPU and PPU chips. It’s just good practice! These 0.1µF axial ceramic cuties were lying in my cap pile ever since I used a handful of them for <a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/tag/tandy1000sx">the cursed Tandy 1000SX</a>, so I was happy to slam two more of them in. The recipe I was following used <code>/RESET</code> as the 5V source, which feels a little sketchy, but it means you don’t have to run long wires all the way to the other end of the chip. Then again, the copper pour on the back of the board <em>is</em> 5V…</p>

<p>I thought 0.1µF might be a little small, but it’s easy to change these out for a 1µF or larger cap if it doesn’t have much effect. You probably shouldn’t pick decoupling caps based on aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="video-amplification">Video Amplification</h2>
<p>The whole idea behind the composite mod is that you’re building a simple signal amplifier to replace the one that was originally inside the RF can.</p>

<p>As the baseband video signal comes out of PPU pin 21, you need to step it up to a level that the TV can easily understand. The video chip’s output transistors are simply not designed to directly drive a television, and after the weak signal goes all the way through the AV cable into the back of the TV, there’s probably not much left to pick up anyway.</p>

<p>There are a lot of homebrew mods for this, ranging from cutting out and reusing the stock transistors on the motherboard to building a whole protoboard circuit with some new parts.</p>

<p>After doing some more research, I decided I would try a part that I’ve been meaning to try for a while, <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/THS7314">the TI THS7314 video amplifier IC</a>. It’s used a lot for <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/thsamps.html">the amplification of analogue RGB signals</a>, and it should work really well for my one-channel signal. The part is designed specifically for this application, and should both install cleanly and produce nice-looking video.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-ths7314-board.png" alt="The prototype board as seen from KiCad. It's very simple, with only a 'video in,' 'audio in,' and 'power in' pinout which then goes to the THS7314 chip."></p>

<p>I made a quick, super-simple little board that basically just broke out the pins of the video amp chip, and sent it to fab at OSH Park. They’ve recently added free (if slow - over a month) shipping to Canada, which makes them a really desirable option for running off onesy-twosie little mod boards like this during the current shipping nightmare we find ourselves in.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-boards-osh.jpg" alt="The two variants of the board - one with the traditional &quot;homebrew amp&quot; design, and the other with the TI THS7314 video amplifier chip."></p>

<p>I made boards to do two variants, one with the original “homebrew” amplifier circuit and one with the THS7314. If the THS7314 doesn’t work out for whatever reason, I can just put in the usual circuit that the community prefers. However - spoilers - the THS7314 worked fine, so I never actually constructed the traditional design.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-v0.2-assembled.jpg" alt="The v0.2 board, assembled. A cap leg comes out of the &quot;R&quot; audio hole, and then directly around in a 180 to the &quot;L&quot; audio hole."></p>

<p>I should have added a jumper to the board to solder left and right audio together (the Famicom is monoaural.) This ugly cap leg trick should be fine for awhile. I decided on a 220µF capacitor for audio, because that’s what was on the top of the cap bin when I opened it.</p>

<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>
<p>The Famicom supports audio coming from the cartridge, which is why Castlevania III on the Famicom has such better music than that on the NES. I definitely want to be able to hear the cartridge audio, so it’s worth pulling the audio from somewhere other than directly out of the CPU (which also contains the sound hardware – lower chip counts = more profit for Nintendo.) The “<a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Cartridge_connector">audio output</a>” pin on the cartridge contains the Famicom’s sound after it has been mixed between the expansion audio and the system audio, where it normally then travels immediately to the RF can for output. Since we’re no longer putting that audio into the RF output stream, it needs to get broken out and fed into the TV using the usual RCA jacks as well.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the GPM-02 motherboard has <a href="https://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/2018/01/famicom-nes-simple-tweaks-to-restore.html">a different ‘mix’ between the expansion audio and the system audio compared to the original Famicom motherboard</a>. You can revert back to the original model’s amplifier behaviour by removing the 43kΩ resistor at R7 and replacing it with a 100kΩ part.</p>

<p>I also removed the choke at FC1 on the motherboard, so that the sound didn’t go into the RF can where it might pick up other noise. To source audio, I just went from the “expansion audio” pin (#46) on the cartridge port and added a 220µF capacitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-gpm02-audio-mods.jpg" alt="The two audio mods done. R7 is replaced with a 100kΩ resistor that I had on hand (sorry it's so big... and backward) and FC1 is removed entirely."></p>

<p>I only had a giant 100kΩ resistor on hand, so that’s the one that went in. This bugs me more than I thought it would.</p>

<p>These changes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD22orMjz48">seem to make a pretty significant impact</a>. I generally don’t have an ear for little tweaks, but this is big enough that even I can pick it out. There’s whole instruments that seem to be missing from the unmodified mix.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-signal-out">Getting The Signal Out</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of different ways I’ve seen of actually getting the composite signal out of the Famicom and into a way that you can plug it into a TV:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cut out the RF box’s antenna jack, and <a href="http://8bitplus.co.uk/projects/famicom-av-mod-nintendo/">replace it with a TRRS jack</a>, which carries all four signals for RCA on one jack;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056561579">Drill holes in the side</a> and put in some panel-mount RCA connectors;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky8rFPbzGMU">Run a female or male RCA cable squid out of the case</a> (usually …</li></ul></article></div>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

I’m not aware of Apple publishing postmortems after outages or providing details about known issues. So it’s up to the developer and admin communities at large to help each other learn about outages and potential causes. With the release of macOS 11.1 this week I’ve been debugging a new issue with the Mac software update process, one which will affect most enterprise users. I decided I should write about it and let everyone know what the issue is, workarounds, and how to avoid it. I’ve also been paying close attention to some recent changes to the software update mechanism, so I’ll try to mention them below as well.</p><h2 id="a-macos-11-bug-prevents-upgrades-to-the-next-version">A macOS 11 bug prevents upgrades to the next version</h2><p>After macOS 11.1 was released earlier this week, many users <a href="https://twitter.com/Contains_ENG/status/1339399335298166785">started reporting</a> that they were not able to see the software update. Others reported that they saw it, but were not able to download it. I personally experienced this issue when 11.1 was in beta and filed a case with Apple about it, but then moved on to other problems. When the final release came out this week, there were widespread reports of it on the MacAdmins Slack. Reading through system logs, I as well as other admins were able to find what appears to be the root cause. <strong>Under certain conditions, macOS 11.0.1 and macOS 11.1 hosts are requesting the update server send the 11.0.1 update, instead of requesting the next available one. The server rejects this update as it’s already either installed or older.</strong> This somehow corrupts the state of the software update process, and the update is no longer visible as an option in System Preferences.</p><figure><img src="https://micromdm.io/big_sur_softwareupdate/log.jpg"></figure><h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3><ul><li>The update is visible again immediately after the restart. But it’s unclear if the update can always be installed after it’s visible since the condition that made it fail to download the first time can be triggered again.</li><li>Removing the MDM enrollment profile causes the update to be seen again. I and several others tested this extensively, and it’s definitely the enrollment profile, not some other policy managed by MDM. This is obviously a terrible workaround and I’d hesitate to mention it to users as it could cause security agents to stop working, and countless approval dialogs we’re so familiar with. Not to mention some of you have the MDM enrollment profile as non-removable or users who are not administrators, so they don’t have permission to unenroll. Getting them back enrolled in the MDM might prove to be a challenge too.</li><li>Distributing the full 11.1, and eventually the 11.2 installers.</li></ul><h3 id="can-apple-fix-this-bug-without-manual-intervention">Can Apple fix this bug without manual intervention?</h3><p>Apple is well aware this is a problem now, so I am confident the issue will be addressed in 11.2. Unfortunately, it is a client-side issue affecting both 11.0.1 and 11.1 clients. So there’s not much Apple <em>can</em> do to provide a fix. One potential solution I see is for Apple to detect the wrong request and instead of rejecting the download, offer the right file archive instead. But this is a complex system and it’s unclear if the server-side changes alone are enough.</p><p>Something else Apple could try is to side load a patch through another software update. There’s background configuration and malware removal tools that are likely capable of fixing the issue on the system. But it’s an ugly hack and one I’d personally stay clear of even if the option was available.</p><p>In my opinion, the most likely outcome is that the bug will be fixed in 11.2, but clients that have already upgraded to Big Sur (or any M1 macs you might’ve bought) will have to work around the problem themselves. If we’re lucky Apple will publish a support article and that will be that.</p><h2 id="what-else-you-need-to-know">What else you need to know</h2><p>Big Sur has changed the software update mechanism entirely, especially on Apple Silicon macs. It’s a long time coming and Apple spoke about some of this at WWDC in the MDM and IT sessions, so it shouldn’t be entirely surprising. But a lot was left unsaid for us to discover on our own.</p><ul><li>Combo update packages are <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/17/apple-has-stopped-providing-standalone-installers-for-macos-updates/">no longer published</a> on the Apple website. This might surprise many of you who rely on distributing them. The main reason is that the entire format of the updates has changed, and it’s also no longer possible to install updates without the Mac having access to the internet. The updates must come from Apple, and they must be managed by <code>softwareupdate</code> and related processes on the system.</li><li>On Apple Silicon, third party processes are no longer able to script the <code>softwareupdate</code> command. Running the software update command as a root process now prompts for the administrator password, who also needs to be a secure token user. There are only two possible options for OS updates to be applied; either the human user of the device itself or the MDM process <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-macos/using-secure-and-bootstrap-tokens-apdff2cf769b/1/web/1.0">which has special permission</a>. It might also be possible for the Mac to update itself with the auto-update mechanism, but there are too many bugs right now to observe how well that works. My personal experience is that it doesn’t and I’m greeted with a password prompt to enter the next day…</li><li>Specifying a custom URL for the <code>softwareupdate</code> process to pull updates from is no longer possible. Apple advertised this deprecation for all of last year, so it should surprise no one but it hurts. <a href="https://github.com/wdas/reposado">Reposado</a> was one of several great tools that made it possible to have unstable/beta/stable tracks within an organization.</li><li>—ignore is gone as a flag. It <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/10-15-5-2020-003-updates-changes-to-softwareupdate-ignore/">was gone</a> in 10.15.5 briefly too, so you likely know about this one. This time it’s gone for good and never coming back. An MDM server can delay the client from seeing OS updates for up to 90 days only, but that is the absolute maximum going forward. Even for a future major release like macOS 12. If this is important to you, file feedback for Apple to provide a second deferral option, specific to major version numbers.</li></ul><p>I work with the MDM protocol a lot day-to-day and have been <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/os_update/">testing</a> software updates for a while. I was even <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/wwdc20-what-s-new-in-managing/">optimistic</a> about what it would look like in Big Sur back in June. Apple had promised it’s an entirely new implementation, closer to what is available on iOS and that everything would work better than before. But we’re not off to a good start, and all the concerns I had for several years now are back. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/commands_and_queries">design</a> of OS updates in MDM is brittle, requiring multiple remote procedure calls to accomplish something that was previously done by a few lines of shell scripting. And that would be bad on its own, but the bad design is coupled with a buggy implementation; there are many known issues, besides the one I described above. Unless something drastically changes, we’re likely to see many months, if not years of software update bugs that are entirely out of our control.</p><p>Apple was never particularly great at building systems for the enterprise. But, until recently, the Unix components were available for software developers and system administrators to work with. The end result ended up being that if you made an investment within your organization, macOS was a great experience for end-users. It took a lot of work, but it was all achievable. Today, Apple is no better at developing systems that are required in the enterprise. But the ball is entirely in their court. Apple still makes great tools for consumers, and there will be a demand from employees to provide them with Apple gear. But, if Apple can’t start acting on our collective feedback, the experience of using a Mac in the workplace will quickly become unbearable to most.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <blockquote>
<p>A year ago YesLogic open-sourced the Allsorts font parser, shaping engine,
and subsetter. In this post we cover how Allsorts has worked out in <a href="https://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a>,
what's improved over the past year, and what we're working on next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts">Allsorts</a> is a Rust crate (library) that can parse OpenType, WOFF, and WOFF2
fonts, shape text, and subset fonts<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At YesLogic we've been using Allsorts to power all font parsing, shaping of
supported scripts, and subsetting in Prince since version 13 was released in November
2019. Aside from the odd small bug revealed by real-world usage and exposure to
new fonts it has proven to be capable and reliable.</p>
<p>Over the past year we've continued to work on Allsorts, adding support for
additional scripts, bitmap and SVG fonts, and refined the
API to make it easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="new-scripts">New Scripts</h2>
<p>Allsorts can now shape the Arabic and Syriac scripts giving us even more coverage of the
world's scripts.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="bitmap-and-svg-fonts">Bitmap and SVG Fonts</h2>
<p>We can now parse OpenType font tables containing bitmaps and SVGs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cblc"><code>CBDT</code>/<code>CBLC</code></a> and <code>EBDT</code>/<code>EBLC</code>, as used by <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/">Noto Color Emoji</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/sbix"><code>sbix</code></a>, as used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Color_Emoji">Apple Color Emoji</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/svg"><code>SVG</code></a>, as used by <a href="https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font">Twitter Color Emoji</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We implemented a unified API that supports retrieving the image for a glyph
independent of the tables it originates from.</p>
<p>The bitmap and SVG support has allowed us to bring emoji and colour SVG font
support to Prince 14:</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="improved-api">Improved API</h2>
<p>Prior to Allsorts 0.5 it was a fairly involved affair to shape some text. You
had to read the font, do glyph mapping, apply glyph substitution (GSUB), and
apply glyph positioning (GPOS) in individual steps which amounted to quite a
bit of code.</p>
<p>Now it's only a few lines. You read the font and construct an instance of the
<code>Font</code> type, turn text into glyphs with a call to <code>map_glyphs</code>, then shape the
text with a call to <code>shape</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Read and parse font
</span><span>let</span><span> buffer = std::fs::read(&amp;opts.font)?;
</span><span>let</span><span> scope = ReadScope::new(&amp;buffer);
</span><span>let</span><span> font_file = scope.read::&lt;FontData&lt;'_&gt;&gt;()?;

</span><span>// Construct Font instance
</span><span>let</span><span> provider = font_file.</span><span>table_provider</span><span>(opts.index)?;
</span><span>let mut</span><span> font = </span><span>match </span><span>Font::new(provider)?
    .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>unable to find suitable cmap subtable</span><span>");
};

</span><span>// Map glyphs
</span><span>let</span><span> glyphs = font.</span><span>map_glyphs</span><span>("</span><span>some text</span><span>", MatchingPresentation::NotRequired);

</span><span>// Shape glyphs
</span><span>let</span><span> script = tag::</span><span>LATN</span><span>;
</span><span>let</span><span> lang = tag::from_string("</span><span>ENG </span><span>")?;
</span><span>let</span><span> shaped_glyphs = font.</span><span>shape</span><span>(
    glyphs,
    script,
    Some(lang),
    &amp;Features::Mask(GsubFeatureMask::default()),
    </span><span>true</span><span>,
)?;
</span></code></pre>
<p>We also renamed a number of types and methods to make their function more
obvious and accurate.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-improvements-and-fixes">Miscellaneous Improvements and Fixes</h2>
<p>Throughout the year we made several other improvements and fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extended our glyph substitution support, implementing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/gpos#lookuptype-8-chained-contexts-positioning-subtable">GSUB Lookup Type
8</a> (Reverse Chaining Contextual Single Substitution), which gains us
support for <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/commas-in-big-numbers-everywhere/">Tristan Hume's Numderline font</a>:</p>

  <figcaption>Text set in the <a href="https://thume.ca/numderline/">Numderline font</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a few bugs and handled some quirks revealed by exposing the code to
a variety of real world fonts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance through:</p>
<ul>
<li>GSUB caching in Arabic, Syriac, and Indic.</li>
<li>Restructuring to avoid unnecessary bounds checks and allocations.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/tinyvec">tinyvec</a> to store codepoints on glyphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for more OpenType features in GSUB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard ligatures (<code>liga</code>).</li>
<li>Discretionary ligatures (<code>dlig</code>).</li>
<li>Historical ligatures (<code>hlig</code>).</li>
<li>Contextual ligatures (<code>clig</code>).</li>
<li>Small caps (<code>smcp</code>).</li>
<li>Small capitals from capitals (<code>c2sc</code>).</li>
<li>Lining figures (<code>lnum</code>).</li>
<li>Oldstyle figures (<code>onum</code>).</li>
<li>Proportional figures (<code>pnum</code>).</li>
<li>Tabular figures (<code>tnum</code>).</li>
<li>Diagonal fractions (<code>frac</code>).</li>
<li>Stacked fractions (<code>afrc</code>).</li>
<li>Ordinals (<code>ordn</code>).</li>
<li>Slashed zero (<code>zero</code>).</li>
<li>Language-specific OpenType shaping (<code>locl</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support fonts with Big5 encoded cmap subtables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>We're currently implementing the following features to make Allsorts
better suited for use cases outside our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose glyph positioning information in shaping output so you don't have to
calculate it yourself.</li>
<li>Retrieve glyph contours as a series of basic drawing operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>After those we hope to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text segmentation by script to allow a chunk of text to be supplied to
Allsorts without having to detect and segment it by script first.</li>
<li>Glyph caching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other items on our radar are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance measurement and optimisation to make it competitive with other
shaping libraries.</li>
<li>Support additional scripts such as Sinhala, and <a href="https://github.com/n8willis/opentype-shaping-documents/blob/master/opentype-shaping-use.md">Indic 3/Universal Shaping
Engine</a>.</li>
<li>Unicode normalisation.</li>
<li>Being able to map shaping output back to the source text.</li>
</ul>

Who are you and what do you do for a living?</h3><p>Hi my name is Anja I'm 27 years old and I'm a female Dockworker/ longshore women from Denmark 😁 sadly at the moment I'm out of work due to the Covid-19</p><h3 id="what-s-your-backstory-and-why-did-you-start-living-a-healthy-lifestyle">What's your backstory and why did you start living a healthy lifestyle?<br></h3><p>I grew up in a relatively normal family, with a big love/ fondness for food. As a teen, I often ate my feelings away, when I was bored or just generally snacking in front of the TV very late in the evening and ate way too big portions of food.</p><p>The reason why I started my weight loss journey was that I no longer felt happy for the reflection in the mirror and overall the way I looked. My weight started to have a negative effect on my life and my physique, I was tired of hating myself and my body and wanted to be able to love myself. I remembered I got tagged in a video on Instagram and I was surprised to see myself and I thought to myself " is that really how I look, is that the way people see me" and it made me sad.</p><p>Due to covid-19 I got fired from my job and at that time I thought to myself now is my chance to change the way I see myself and the way I look, so I contacted a personal trainer one of my friends had recommended and I started my Weight Loss Journey.<br></p><h3 id="how-was-it-in-the-beginning-and-what-were-the-biggest-obstacles-you-overcame">How was it in the beginning and what were the biggest obstacles you overcame?</h3><p>The first 2 weeks was the hardest, I had to get used to not eating as much as I used to and focusing on getting the right nutritions protein, and veggies, it's hard to break old habits and make new ones but as soon as I got over the two weeks mark, then for me, it started to feel natural and it was easier to incorporate in my daily life/ routine</p><h3 id="what-were-your-worst-mistakes">What were your worst mistakes?</h3><p>My worst mistake was thinking that I didn't do enough, that I didn't eat healthy enough, and that I didn't exercise enough at the beginning of my weight-loss journey. I pushed myself really hard and didn't get fast enough results in my opinion! because of that mentality and because of those thoughts I almost didn't go through with my weight-loss program, I lost my motivation real quick and quickly found out I had to change my mentality to be able to keep moving forward.</p><p>The biggest milestone for me was when my clothing started to feel loose around my body and when I could see the physical change. A good motivation boost was also when I could do more with the weights at my gym and when I could perform more and I didn't get out of breath within 5-minutes. It is often small things that motivate me the most, for example being able to squat a bit more than last time or being able to run a bit longer.</p><h3 id="what-area-of-life-has-changed-after-becoming-more-healthy">What area of life has changed after becoming more healthy?</h3><p>Because I'm being more active and healthy I feel like I have gotten more opportunities in life. I am no longer bound by my physique and I'm happier for my body, I like where I am and it has an effect on the people surrounding me. They can feel that I have gotten a lot more energy and it makes them happy on my behalf.<br></p><h3 id="what-is-your-weekly-training-protocol-how-many-days-per-week-do-you-train-how-are-your-workouts-structured">What is your weekly training protocol? How many days per week do you train, how are your workouts structured?</h3><p>I work with a personal trainer 2 times a week, one day with strength training and one day with cardio training, and an everyday goal of 10.000 steps sometimes I workout more depending on my motivation and the time I have available. (by myself)</p><h3 id="what-is-your-nutrition-and-diet-approach-do-you-follow-a-specific-meal-plan-or-eating-structure">What is your nutrition and diet approach? Do you follow a specific meal plan or eating structure?</h3><p>I do follow a semi-strict meal plan, I eat 1300 calories a day, 6 small meals spread out throughout the day. I drink a lot of water before my meal and in between my meals.

			<div>
				<p>Functional unit and integration tests are a standard tool of any software development organization,
helping not only to ensure correctness of newly implemented code,
but also to identify regressions — bugs in existing functionality introduced by a code change.
The situation looks different though when it comes to regressions related to non-functional requirements, in particular performance-related ones:
How to detect increased response times in a web application?
How to identify decreased throughput?</p>
<p>These aspects are typically hard to test in an automated and reliable way in the development workflow,
as they are dependent on the underlying hardware and the workload of an application.
For instance assertions on the duration of specific requests of a web application typically cannot be run in a meaningful way on a developer laptop,
which differs from the actual production hardware
(ironically, nowadays both is an option, the developer laptop being less or more powerful than the actual production environment).
When run in a virtualized or containerized CI environment, such tests are prone to severe measurement distortions due to concurrent load of other applications and jobs.</p>
<p>This post introduces the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">JfrUnit</a> open-source project, which offers a fresh angle to this topic by supporting assertions not on metrics like latency/throughput themselves, but on <em>indirect metrics</em> which may impact those.
JfrUnit allows you define expected values for metrics such as memory allocation, database I/O, or number of executed SQL statements, for a given workload and asserts the actual metrics values — which are obtained from <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328">JDK Flight Recorder</a> events — against these expected values.
Starting off from a defined base line, future failures of such assertions are an indicator for potential performance regressions in an application, as a code change may have introduced higher GC pressure,
the retrieval of unneccessary data from the database, or SQL problems commonly induced by ORM tools, like N+1 SELECT statements.</p>
<p>JfrUnit provides means of identifying and analyzing such anomalies in a reliable, environment independent way in standard JUnit tests,
before they manifest as actual performance regressions in production.
Test results are independent from wall clock time and thus provide actionable information, also when not testing with production-like hardware and data volumes.</p>
<p>This post is a bit longer than usual (I didn’t have the time to write shorter ;), but it’s broken down into several sections,
so you can pause and continue later on with fresh energy:</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_getting_started_with_jfrunit">Getting Started With JfrUnit</h2>
<div>
<p>JfrUnit is an extension for <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit 5</a> which integrates Flight Recorder into unit tests;
it makes it straight forward to initiate a JFR recording for a given set of event types,
execute some test routine, and then assert the JFR events which should have been produced.</p>
<p>Here is a basic example of a JfrUnit test:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>@JfrEventTest</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>JfrUnitTest</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>gc</span><span>();</span>
    <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="5"></i><b>5</b></td>
<td><code>JfrEvents#ofType()</code> allows to filter on specific event types, enabling arbitrary assertions against the returned stream of <code>RecordedEvent</code>s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>By means of a custom <code>assertThat()</code> matcher method for <a href="https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a>,
JfrUnit allows to validate that specific JFR events are raised during at test.
Events to be matched are described via their event type name, and optionally one more event attribute vaues.
As we’ll see in a bit, JfrUnit also integrates nicely with the Java Stream API,
allowing you to filter and aggregate recorded event atribute values and match them against expected values.</p>
<p>JfrUnit persists a JFR recording file for each test method,
which you can examine after a test failure,
for instance using <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/">JDK Mission Control</a>.
To learn more about JfrUnit and its capabilities, take a look at the project’s <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">README</a>.
The project is in an early proof-of-concept stage at the moment,
so changes to its APIs and semantics are likely.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve taken the JfrUnit quick tour, let’s put that knowledge into practice.
Our example project will be the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfr-custom-events">Todo Manager</a> Quarkus application you may already be familiar with from my <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">earlier post</a> about custom JFR events.
We’re going to discuss two examples for using JfrUnit to identify potential performance regressions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_case_study_1_spotting_increased_memory_allocation">Case Study 1: Spotting Increased Memory Allocation</h2>
<div>
<p>At first, let’s explore how to identify increased memory allocation rates.
Typically, it’s mostly library and middleware authors who are interested in this.
For a library such as Hibernate ORM it can make a huge difference whether a method that is invoked many times on a hot code path allocates a few objects more or less.
Less object allocations mean less work for the garbage collector,
which in turn means those precious CPU cores of your machine can spend more cycles processing your actual business logic.</p>
<p>But also for application developers it can be beneficial to keep an eye on — and systematically track — object allocations,
as regressions there lead to increased GC pressure,
and in turn eventually to higher latencies and reduced throughput.</p>
<p>The key for tracking object allocations with JFR are the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> and <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB</code> events,
which are emitted when</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an object allocation triggered the creation of a new thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an object got allocated outside of the thread’s TLAB</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Thread-local allocation buffers (TLAB)</p>
<p>When creating new object instances on the heap,
this primarily happens via <em>thread-local allocation buffers</em>.
A TLAB is a pre-allocated memory block that’s exclusively used by a single thread.
Since this space is exclusively owned by the thread, creating new objects within a TLAB can happen without costly synchronization with other threads.
Once a thread’s current TLAB capacity is about to be exceeded by a new object allocation,
a new TLAB will be allocated for that thread.
In addition, large objects will typically need to be directly allocated outside of the more efficient TLAB space.</p>
<p>To learn more about TLAB allocation, refer to  <a href="https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/4-tlab-allocation/">part #4</a> of Aleksey Shipilёv’s "JVM Anatomy Quark" blog series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note these events don’t allow for tracking of each individual object allocation,
as multiple objects will be allocated within a TLAB before a new one is required, and thus the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> event will be emitted.
But as that event exposes the size of the new TLAB, we can keep track of the overall amount of memory that’s allocated while the application is running.</p>
<p>In that sense, <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> represents a sampling of object allocations,
which means we need to collect a reasonable number of events to identify those locations in the program which are the sources of high object allocation and thus frequently trigger new TLAB creations.</p>
<p>So let’s start and work on a test for spotting regressions in terms of object allocations of one of the Todo Manager app’s API methods, <code>GET /todo/{id}</code>.
To identify a baseline of the allocation to be expected,
we first invoke that method in a loop and print out the actual allocation values.
This should happen in intervals, e.g. every 10,000 invocations,
so to average out numbers from individual API calls.</p>

<p>Not everyone understands how open source is made. I received the following email from NASA a while ago.</p>



<h2>Subject: Curl Country of Origin and NDAA Compliance</h2>



<blockquote><p>Hello, my name is [deleted] and I am a Supply Chain Risk Management Analyst at NASA. As such, I ensure that all NASA acquisitions of Covered Articles comply with Section 208 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law 116-94, enacted December 20, 2019. To do so, the Country of Origin (CoO) information must be obtained from the company that develops, produces, manufactures, or assembles the product(s). To do so, please provide an email response or a formal document (a PDF on company letterhead is preferred, but a simple statement is sufficient) specifically identifying the country, or countries, in which Curl <strong>is developed and maintained</strong></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If the country of origin is outside the United States, please provide any information you may have stating that testing is performed in the United States prior to supplying products to customers. Additionally, if available, please identify all authorized resellers of the product in question.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Lastly, please confirm that Curl <strong>is not developed by, contain components developed by</strong>, or receive substantial influence from entities prohibited by Section 889 of the 2019 NDAA. These entities include the following companies and any of their subsidiaries or affiliates:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Hytera Communications Corporation<br>Huawei Technologies Company<br>ZTE Corporation<br>Dahua Technology Company<br>Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company</p><p>Finally, we have a time frame of 5 days for a response.<br>Thank you,</p></blockquote>



<h2>My answer</h2>



<p>Okay, I first considered going with strong sarcasm in my reply due to the complete lack of understanding, and the implied threat in that last line. What would happen if I wouldn’t respond in time?</p>



<p>Then it struck me that this could be my chance to once and for all get a confirmation if curl is already actually used in space or not. So I went with informative and a friendly tone.</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi [name],</p><p>I will answer to these questions below to the best of my ability, and maybe you can answer something for me?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>curl (https://curl.se) is an open source project that creates two products, curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. I am the founder, lead developer and core maintainer of the project. To this date, I have done about 57% of the 26,000 changes in the source code repository. The remaining 43% have been done by 841 different volunteers and contributors from all over the world. Their names can be extracted from our git repository: https://github.com/curl/curl</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You can also see that I own most, but not all, copyrights in the project.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am a citizen of Sweden and I’ve been a citizen of Sweden during the entire time I’ve done all and any work on curl. The remaining 841 co-authors are from all over the world, but primarily from western European countries and the US. You could probably say that we live primarily “on the Internet” and not in any particular country.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have resellers. I work for an American company (wolfSSL) where we do curl support for customers world-wide.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Our testing is done universally and is not bound to any specific country or region. We test our code substantially before release.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Me knowingly, we do not have any components or code authored by people at any of the mentioned companies.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So finally my question: can you tell me anything about where or for what you use curl? Is it used in anything in space?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Regards,<br>Daniel</p></blockquote>



<h2>Used in space?</h2>



<p>Of course my attempt was completely in vain and the answer back was very brief and it just said…</p>

All applications have been tested on FreeBSD but should run on other Unix-like
operating systems as well.</p>

<h2 id="3dpong">3D Pong</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/3dpong.gif" alt="3dpong" height="610" width="590"></p><p><a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/3dpong/index2.php3">3D Pong</a>
is three-dimensional version of the first arcade game, “Pong”, for the X Window
System.</p>
<pre><code># pkg install games/3dpong</code></pre>
<p>To play against the computer, run:</p>
<pre><code>$ 3dpong :0 --computer --sound</code></pre>

<h2 id="angband">Angband</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/angband.gif" alt="angband" height="368" width="652"></p><p>A roguelike game derived from Moria, based loosely on the books of
J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R.  Tolkien. The ultimate aim of the game is to advance in
skill and strength, collecting better and more powerful magical items until you
are ready to face the Master of the dungeon: Morgoth himself! Start the
X11 mode with <code>angband -mx11</code>.</p>
<pre><code># pkg install games/angband</code></pre>

<h2 id="battalion">Battalion</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/battalion.gif" alt="battalion" height="530" width="650"></p><p>Battalion is a 3D game from 1994, originally written for the Silicon Graphics
Indy UNIX workstation. The player controls a monster to blow up a city. The
author dedicated a
<a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/AndyBattalion.html">website</a> to the
game.</p>

<p>Depending on the perspective, the controls are a little awkward. You may
want to change the camera with key <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
<code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>. Use the mouse to rotate and to move
forward/backward. The arrow keys only work if the mouse cursor is placed in the
center of the screen. Shoot with the left control key or the left mouse button,
and tilt the head with <code>A</code> and <code>Z</code> to target helicopters
and jets. The camera can be rotated with <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>,
<code>K</code>, and <code>L</code>. Alter the rendering details with
<code>D</code>. Press <code>G</code> to grab the mouse cursor and
<code>P</code> to pause the game.</p>

<p>I made a quick &amp; dirty
<a href="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/battalion1.4b-freebsd.tar.gz">FreeBSD port</a> based on the Linux

Its unsustainable growth strategy destroyed billions in shareholder value. Has WeWork finally hit rock bottom, or is it a falling knife?&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t have a crystal ball, but based on the work we have done, we believe WeWork has most of the pieces in place for a powerful turnaround.</p><p>In January 2019, WeWork was valued at $47B, making it the second-largest private company at the time, 15x the price of its closest competitor. After its failed IPO at the end of 2019, it nosedived to $7.3B. In March 2020, just as offices around the world were closing amid the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank refused to participate in a $3B tender offer of early employee shares. The valuation of WeWork fell all the way to $2.9B, down 94% from its peak.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><em>WeWork’s rise from startup to $47B company took 9 years—its fall back down to $2.9B took just over 1.</em></p><p>The private markets have gone from euphoria to disillusion with WeWork. The company was downgraded again by credit rating agency Fitch in October 2020, and its cash burn through the year so far is estimated to be above $1.6B.</p><p>Our research shows that after all the recent changes, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We aggregated public data, analyzed financial data, talked to real estate brokers, developers, industry experts and built a model.&nbsp;</p><p>We can scoff at WeWork’s one-page long community adjusted EBITDA, but the company has been undergoing a reorganization towards profitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Key decisions include rightsizing their real estate portfolio, exiting 66 unprofitable leases, effecting a favorable shift in customer mix shift with 60% revenue now coming from enterprises, reducing the size of the workforce from 14,000 to 5,000 and hiring a new management team.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to WeWork’s internal efforts, the most unexpected tailwind is that the global experiment of remote working that we’ve seen during COVID may give rise to a structurally more flexible and distributed workforce in the near future. Ironically, the economic downturn many thought would sink WeWork may become the very cause of its survival.&nbsp;</p><p>A capital-light strategy is also on the horizon (a genuine one this time). Once the dust settles, WeWork could leverage its existing business and office management services and transform itself into a franchise provider.</p><div>

    <h2 id="wework-s-road-to-redemption--">WeWork’s road to redemption&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Our DCF model gives WeWork a valuation of $3.5B.</strong> At this price, WeWork equity resembles a call option, with limited downside but asymmetric upside.</li><li><strong>The site economics behind WeWork's core business are surprisingly positive. </strong>24 months after opening, the average WeWork location can generate a 20% contribution margin, compared with economics from more stable peers. A big reason for WeWork’s cash burn was its lack of mature locations. In 2019, WeWork had the biggest flexible workspace footprint, but the lowest % of mature sites, comparing with its profit-making peers.</li><li><strong>WeWork has become much more prudent in new location openings.</strong> Mature locations are expected to grow to 50% by the end of 2020 and reach 100% in 2022.</li><li><strong>WeWork has spent 2020 stabilizing its core operations</strong> with 4 key measures.</li><li><strong>60% of WeWork's customers are now enterprises.</strong> During the pandemic, WeWork leased 3.5 million square feet to enterprise clients, including TikTok, Mastercard, Microsoft, Citigroup and Deloitte.</li><li><strong>WeWork's new CEO is a real estate veteran.</strong> The current CEO is a disciplined operator with successful turnaround experience.</li><li><strong>WeWork has rightsized its real estate portfolio.</strong> We estimate WeWork has exited 66 locations and amended about 150 leases, driving higher average occupancy and margins across their portfolio.</li><li><strong>WeWork has cut costs.</strong> WeWork has shrunk its workforce by 60% and cut many experimental growth projects, such as WeLive, WeGrow and self-driving chairs. Operating expenses are trending down significantly, from 86% of revenue in 2018 to an estimated 50% in 2019.</li><li><strong>Market dynamics are changing.</strong> Post-COVID, 80% of people want to return to the office a few days a week but keep the benefit of flexibility. Ironically, the downturn many thought would sink WeWork may become the very cause of its survival.</li><li><strong>WeWork is quietly transitioning to an integrated, tech-enabled ecosystem coordinator.</strong> Despite the large cost-cutting, WeWork continues to invest in community services, aka, the "killer app". For example, WeWork Labs is a community digital platform. It provides cross-sector incubator services to support companies to acquire skills, meet peers and experts.</li><li><strong>WeWork could reshape the real estate stack. </strong>It could leverage its physical locations and build a tech-enabled layer on top, thereby, transform into a middleware to connect people and optimize spaces.</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--wework-is-worth--3-5b">Valuation: WeWork is worth $3.5B</h2><p>Our base case discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model implies a 2021 forward equity value of $3.5B for WeWork.&nbsp;</p><p>WeWork still has the shape of a distressed company. The capital structure is heavily indebted and equity is at the bottom of the pecking order. Nevertheless, the equity resembles the asymmetric risk/reward profile of an out of the money call option.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, given the current financial and operating dynamics of the company, for every one unit of enterprise value increase, the upside is amplified for the equity holders.&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone to stand behind WeWork now, however, they must be comfortable with a lot of macro uncertainties related to GDP, unemployment, speed of returning to the office and the opportunities around what the future of workspace would look like.&nbsp;</p><p>If WeWork can stabilize their operations in the near term through delayed capital spending, improved occupancy and regained focus, there could be a meaningful upside.</p><p>We highlight the structure of our model below.&nbsp;</p><p>Our aim with our model is to capture WeWork’s key growth and cost drivers to have a sense of the company’s profit-making potential. We used company disclosures from 2019 and turnaround guidance to form the base case assumptions. Our model calculates enterprise value by subtracting net debt and capitalized operating leases to derive equity value.&nbsp;</p><p>We can summarize our DCF into three distinct phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1: 2020 - 2024 turnaround and stabilization.&nbsp;</li><li>Phase 2: 2025 - 2030 disciplined growth in the core business, expansion in franchise model and other business services.&nbsp;</li><li>Phase 3: 2031+ steady-state growth at 2%, with the overall occupancy to remain at 90%.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We disaggregate revenue into total workstations, total memberships and average revenue per member (“ARPM”) to derive occupancy rates. We also build a CapEx profile based on cost per workstation to calculate location level contribution margin (WeWork defines contribution margin as membership revenue minus location operating expenses before headquarter administrative costs, growth expenses, marketing and stock-based compensation).&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/40c25e89-a189-4840-9598-e31e51bb39f4_Screen+Shot+2020-12-17+at+16.39.31.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>WeWork's revenue drivers. </em></p><p>WeWork doubled its total workstations between 2016 and 2019. As a result, mature locations accounted for only c.30% of the overall portfolio. To preserve cash and streamline operations, the pace of expansion has slowed significantly. The base case assumes total workstations to grow at 5% p.a. to reach 1.2M by 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>We illustrate our key revenue and cost assumptions below.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Austria on July 30, 1947. Famously, he reached stratospheric levels of notoriety and success in three wholly distinct professional fields: bodybuilding, acting, and politics, culminating in his eight years as the Governor of California.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For the past 73 years, Schwarzenegger has gone by Arnold, Ahnuld, Governator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Austrian Oak</a>, Terminator, Running Man, and dozens of other nicknames. In part because he’s charismatic and there’s nicknames aplomb to describe him, sure.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>But also because his last name is hard to spell. Like, really hard.</strong> We would know, because Water Cooler Trivia participants have spelled Schwarzenegger 255 different ways. And we’ve dug deep to explore that data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>255 different spellings. <a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/feature-emojis"><strong>We don’t grade responses based on spellings</strong></a>, so these are the spellings we’ve accepted as correct. We’ve got the full list of them at the end of this article, but we wanted to dig deeper into the data<br></p><h2>First things first: here’s the trivia question<br></h2><blockquote><strong>“What is the name of the Austrian bodybuilder who has been Mr. Universe three times and Mr. Olympia seven times?”</strong><br></blockquote><p>The answer, as you’ve surely guessed by now, is Arnold Schwarzenegger. We first wrote this question in April 2019, and since then…</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>3,019 different participants</strong> across 306 different groups have submitted a response</li><li><strong>2,681</strong> (89%) of folks got the question correct</li><li><strong>1,616</strong> (60%) of correct responses were spelled correctly [editor’s note: we suspect phone and browser autocorrect software lent a helping hand here]</li><li><strong>255</strong> different spellings of Schwarzenegger during that time<br></li></ul><p>And now, let’s look at the different ways in which Schwarzenegger has been spelled by Water Cooler Trivia participants.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. What are the most common misspellings?</h2><p>When you remove the correct spelling, you are left with 1,060 participants who spelled Schwarzenegger in 254 different ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The most common misspelling is to simply add a <strong>T </strong>after the <strong>R</strong>, a.k.a <strong>Schwartzenegger</strong>. This makes sense, as Schwartz itself is a fairly common German surname. 116 different respondents, 4% of all correct responses, spelled Arnold’s surname with that bonus <strong>T.</strong><br></p><p>Next up was <strong>Schwarzeneger</strong>, which removes a letter rather than adding one, this time removing one of the two <strong>G</strong>s. Again, this matches intuition.

Wait, how many letters is it?</h2><p>It’s 14 letters. S-c-h-w-a-r-z-e-n-e-g-g-e-r. But not everyone realized that.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of the 255 total different spellings,&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>169</strong> (66%) had fewer than 14 letters</li><li><strong>24</strong> (9%) had more than 14 letters</li><li><strong>61</strong> (24%) correctly had 14 letters but were spelled incorrectly</li><li><strong>1</strong> (0.4%) correctly had 14 letters and was spelled correctly<br></li></ul><p>The most popular length was 13 letters with 31% of distinct spellings and 13% of all correct responses.</p><figure id="w-node-b1be6443de1a-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf088a2f4f273d8970_jDn-VaUiTJ_o9aGXBHJpAgFsSNJ4qViTLF0n0X5ZsN1kWQFbC7nS7JO88_K3BwfEaYJEkkT60LeNMN6-x7CwXgXXpJPsO7JLx7fPFXYMxPmM2bmSAaVNS0g1ttJBCkZDVdFqo_jX.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. So it starts with an S... then a C… then...</h2><p>Schwarzenegger starts with the letter S. That’s fairly obvious. In fact, of the 255 distinct spellings that accepted as correct, 100% of them started with the letter <strong>S</strong>. However, once you move on to the second letter, <strong>only 58% of the spellings had C as the second letter.</strong><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, the share of “correct” letters in terms of positions descends as you get further in the word, with a few noticeable deviations: interestingly, misspellings tend to correctly guess that the 11th letter is a <strong>G</strong> and the 14th letter is an <strong>R</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><figure id="w-node-3153958d4ef7-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf6ef4066cb3b8bc5a_SVo29XaQjA6jKuUkHuTPk1t2s967m2NoVPJrmpRPCGKe3Hrzg40C8kdhQvOqWkjw_BH_8noZ2ds0YGXkppq-B22DsD0PZ6auFQTHvSlEjpjzYw7r1Htdz5sFgWl7oAdN6pVAGp-6.png" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Double Letters</h4><p>On that topic, Schwarzenegger has a double letter in it: two G’s as the 11th and 12th letter. This was a common source of misspellings, as 1<strong>47 of the distinct spellings (58%) guessed that there was only one G</strong> in the politician’s surname.<br></p><h4>Edit Distance</h4><p>Known as edit distance or Levenshtein distance, this is a measure of how many changes you need to make to a word or phrase in order to translate it into another word or phrase. <strong>So “bake” has a distance of one from “cake” or “ake” or “baked”.</strong><br></p><p>When you search the internet for <strong>Girrafe</strong> and the search engine asks <strong><em>“Did you mean Giraffe?”</em></strong><em> </em>they are making that guess because your search query only had an edit distance of two from the more common query term <strong>Giraffe</strong>. One deletion (the first <strong>R</strong>) and one insertion (the second <strong>F</strong>) turns your query into the correct word.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So, basically, this is a way to see <strong><em>how bad </em></strong>certain spellings were. Or, more optimistically, how generous we at Water Cooler Trivia are as graders.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Okay, with all that prologue finished, here’s the edit distance stats for the 255 distinct spellings of Schwarzenegger. Note that we are only surfacing the 1,060 responses that were incorrectly spelled.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>34% had an edit distance of only one</strong>!</li><li>And another 28% were only off by two characters!</li><li>18% of misspellings had an edit distance of at least four</li></ul><figure id="w-node-00b9f866edfc-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcfee56eb8449ae2563_Qw6LyfdHxuw1-KuhsN3NFHyHzwr-1PnjCWoBqcc6pBTMNmr1DKqO-LmCkjcwMx-wn3K4inzJcTAnSOQCLQokxfe_psFkS6F8YkA4ohbuvw5kcvg7D9ApQtGulyfaG4kXCjRYgV-r.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. What does Schwarzenegger even mean?</h2><p>I was wondering that too. It turns out the name has Germanic roots, divided neatly into two terms.</p><ul role="list"><li>"schwarzen" means "black"</li><li>&nbsp;"egg" refers to a ridge<br></li></ul><p>So the Governator’s surname <strong>translates most literally into English as Black Ridge</strong>, which happens to be the name of a U.S. <a href="https://www.blackridge.us/"><strong>technology services company</strong></a>.</p><h2>Closing thoughts...</h2><p>Looking to learn about more commonly-misspelled names or commonly-mistaken knowledge?

<p><i></i> <b>Note:</b> This post is about <a href="https://pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> who is now my employer. If you don’t want to hear about that, look away now.</p>
<p><i></i> <b>Note:</b> Some images have been redacted to protect the innocent</p>
<p>I can remember the exact moment I first realized I <em>didn’t</em> want to be a software developer. It was May 2009, and I was desperately trying to finish my final University project for the module “object-orientated Programming.”</p>
<p>My module tutor had tasked us with creating an application of our choosing in VB.NET. I can unapologetically say I didn’t enjoy the process. I preferred focusing on systems, understanding how things fit together. I was spending my days getting stuck in the minutiae of fixing bugs in my code.</p>
<p>My career progression from there followed a fairly traditional “System Administrator” path. I managed some Linux servers, the number grew, and I went headfirst into configuration management. As the DevOps movement came around, I embraced Kubernetes early and spent several years using cutting edge technologies in exciting ways. Despite telling myself in 2009 I didn’t want to be a software engineer, in 2020 I got my first “software engineer” title here at Pulumi, and now I’m lucky enough to spend my time writing code to program the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="https://pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> is an exciting product, but what’s incredible to see working here is how the platform scales. All of the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/">Pulumi provider</a> SDKs get programmatically generated, which means that once support for a language gets added, all of the available providers will get that SDK generated. Adding a new language has significant engineering work up front, of course, but ongoing maintenance burden drops over time rather than increases.</p>
<p>In November 2019, Pulumi added support for the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-dotnet-core/">.NET core languages</a>. We’ve seen significant adoption from the .NET community, and if you take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples">examples repo</a>, you’ll see dozens of examples of creating cloud infrastructure with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>, the flagship languages of the .NET framework.</p>
<p>Of course, .NET core languages also include my trusty old friend VB.NET. I haven’t written a single line of VB.Net since I handed in my university project in 2009, and I have a vague recollection that I told myself that I never would again.</p>
<p>However, this is 2020. So I asked myself, what is the very last thing I would want to create with Pulumi in VB.NET. The answer is obvious, of course - Kubernetes resources.</p>

<p>In many ways, VB.NET and Kubernetes couldn’t be further apart. VB.NET, of old Microsoft - a language of “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/code-behind">code-behind</a>”, written for the era of monolithic desktop apps and windows forms and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a complex distributed system written to be <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">cloud-native</a>.</p>
<p>With nostalgia in mind, I asked in our internal slack just how good our VB.NET support was. I quickly got a helpful answer from one of our <a href="https://twitter.com/mikhailshilkov">resident .NET experts</a> which can when summarized is along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should work, but…why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that question in my mind was of course, because it’s 2020.
Our <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/templates/">Pulumi templates</a> (used to bootstrap new Pulumi projects) helpfully already had <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/templates/tree/master/aws-visualbasic">VisualBasic examples</a>. I imagine they’re lonely, because I couldn’t find a single record of them ever getting used.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping my new cloud VB.NET project, I could feel the old familiarity of hating being a software developer return to me. Shaking off the innate feeling, I set about doing the Pulumi equivalent of “Hello, world” - creating an S3 bucket in AWS.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Imports</span> <span>Pulumi</span>
<span>Imports</span> <span>Pulumi.Aws.S3</span>

<span>Class</span> <span>MyStack</span>
    <span>Inherits</span> <span>Stack</span>

    <span>Public</span> <span>Sub</span> <span>New</span><span>()</span>
        <span>' Create an AWS resource (S3 Bucket)</span>
        <span>Dim</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>=</span> <span>New</span> <span>Bucket</span><span>(</span><span>"my-bucket"</span><span>)</span>

        <span>' Export the name of the bucket</span>
        <span>Me</span><span>.</span><span>BucketName</span> <span>=</span> <span>bucket</span><span>.</span><span>Id</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>Sub</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>Public</span> <span>Property</span> <span>BucketName</span> <span>As</span> <span>Output</span><span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>End</span> <span>Class</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I sort of hoped it would fail. VB.Net is 19 years old. Surely it has no place provisioning AWS resources?</p>
<p>I had some difficulty familiarizing myself with the syntax, but after yelling at my IDE a couple times, I finally managed to get my S3 bucket created.</p>
<p>At this point, I decided to antagonize the internet and rehash a meme from earlier in the year:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-tweet-1.png" alt="Meme"></p>
<p>The responses I received weren’t surprising:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-tweet-2.png" alt="Twitter"></p>
<p>Undeterred, I went for broke. Adding the Kubernetes provider and building out the required resources to deploy to an already provisioned EKS cluster was easier than I expected. I actually started to feel like the syntax of VB.net felt oddly suited to the task. It looks…. good?</p>

<p>I shared what I’d done with some of the Slack communities I frequent:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-slack-1.png" alt="Slack"></p>
<p>I knew what I was doing was a little controversial, but I wasn’t ready for this:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-slack-2.png" alt="Slack"></p>
<p>I felt defensive all of a sudden. Was I starting to feel defensive of VB.NET?</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/funcOfJoe/">the CEO of Pulumi</a>, a man who knows a thing or two about programming languages saw my example code and saw the beauty of what I’d done:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-twitter-3.png" alt="Joe"></p>
<p>Not everyone saw the inner-beauty:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-email-1.png" alt="Email"></p>
<p>You can see this incredible collaboration of old and new here:</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Uq17k64ym5x4tl2aLmTFRg3i0"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/Uq17k64ym5x4tl2aLmTFRg3i0.svg" alt="asciicast"></a></p>
<p>The full code, if you’d like to see it, is <a href="https://github.com/jaxxstorm/eks-vb-net">here</a></p>
<p>If you’d ask me what I learned from this experience, I’d be honest and say - nothing. Do I really believe VB.NET is the future of cloud engineering? No. It’s not. I’m unlikely to recommend to Pulumi customers that they break out Visual Studio and write some VB.NET, but we know the options is there if they ever want to use it.</p>
<p>I’ve gone on record before to talk about how much I <a href="http://leebriggs.co.uk/blog/2020/12/16/2019-02-07-why-are-we-templating-yaml.md">loathe templating YAML</a> and I love the expressibility Pulumi gives me with familiar programming languages. Even though I hated VB.NET in university, I would still prefer to express my cloud resources with a 19-year-old programming language over a configuration language with template replacement.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><time datetime="2020-11-15">November 15, 2020</time></p><p>Do you ever come across a technology or concept and say to yourself, "This is insane, how can anyone understand this?". If so, this essay may help you to answer that question; how do people understand extremely complex concepts?</p><p>Central Processing Units (CPUs) are a particularly bewildering piece of technology. These 2 inch squares of silicon are the brains behind a computer, a machine capable of solving all solvable problems given enough time and resources.</p><p><img src="https://www.apple.com/v/mac/m1/a/images/overview/chip__fffqz3ljssi2_large.jpg" alt="https://www.apple.com/v/mac/m1/a/images/overview/chip__fffqz3ljssi2_large.jpg"></p><p>Apple's new M1 chip</p><p>"The people who make CPUs must have superhuman intellect" I think to myself. This may be true to an extent, chip makers and CPU designers are very bright, however their domain expertise is likely isolated to an extremely specific component of the CPU. It is important when analyzing any complex concept to acknowledge all of its components. In the case of a CPU, there are thousands of components built on top of each-other.</p><p>Don't be disheartened if a concept appears incomprehensible at first glance, it may very well be incomprehensible to those who created it, particularly when that concept is at the bleeding edge of technology. How can a CPU designer design a CPU without understanding all of its inner workings? The same way an architect designs a house without understanding the details of construction, and the same way a software developer uses an API without understanding its implementation details. Complex technologies and concepts are not the result of omniscient individuals, but rather layers of knowledge, built upon, and composed of one-another. The authors of these layers of knowledge are the specialists, who have spent years mastering the knowledge associated with their layer. The mental model for understanding these layers, and the central topic of this essay, is&nbsp;<strong>Knowledge APIs</strong></p><blockquote><p>Knowledge API: A mental model for thinking about the understanding of a specific domain as an Application Programming Interface (API). Knowledge APIs depend on, and can be used by one-another. A knowledge API is like a module in a programming language, it depends on (imports) other knowledge APIs, and can be used by (exported) other knowledge APIs. - Chris Behan</p></blockquote><p>To illustrate the idea of a knowledge API, let's use CPUs as an example. Suppose one of the knowledge APIs used in CPU production is dedicated to the etching of microscopic lines into silicon. An example function from this API would be:</p><pre><code><span>//MicroscopicLaserEtchingAPI</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</span><span>(</span><span>startPos</span><span>,</span><span> endPos</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>// Code instructing laser to etch microscopic line from startPos to endPos</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>The group of people responsible for the implementation of&nbsp;<code>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</code>&nbsp;understand how it works. They know all about the optics of the laser, and how to manipulate its exact position. They know the physical properties of the silicon chip, and how it reacts when it comes in contact with the laser. But they do <strong>not</strong> know how others will use this function. They have no insight into how the lines they produce may be composed to represent logic gates. That is where the next layer of the Knowledge API comes into play; the group responsible for composing the lines into logical structures. This layer of the knowledge API (Let's call them the Logical Structures API) has functions like:</p><pre><code><span>//LogicalStructuresAPI</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"MicroscopicLaserEtchingAPI"</span><span>;</span><span>
</span>
<span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>CreateANDGate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> xPos </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>CalculateANDGateXPos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// function within this knowledge API</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> yPos </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>CalculateANDGateYPos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// function within this knowledge API</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</span><span>(</span><span>xPos</span><span>,</span><span> yPos</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>The people in this layer are dedicated to composing the logical structures that make up the CPU. They do not understand the implementation details of the layer below them, such as how a microscopic laser is able to precisely engrave nano-meter thick lines into silicon. They must trust and use functions from the&nbsp;<code>MicroscopicLaserEthcingAPI</code>. The authors of the&nbsp;<code>LogicalStructuresAPI</code>&nbsp;depend on the correctness of the&nbsp;<code>MicroscopicLaserEtchingAPI</code>, in this case, that&nbsp;<code>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSillicon</code>&nbsp;really does etch a line into the silicon chip, at precisely the location specified. Trust between layers is a requirement of knowledge APIs. If a knowledge API does not do exactly what it says, and that knowledge API is used by another knowledge API, incorrect behaviour will be introduced to the system.</p><p>The process of knowledge APIs built on-top of one-another continues for hundreds (sometimes thousands) of layers, producing results that to the untrained eye appear magical. But there is no magic, just layers of abstractions masterfully crafted by experts of that knowledge API. Sometimes individuals, through years of hard work and deliberate practice, are able to understand and master multiple knowledge APIs, but no one understands all of them. Similar to how no-one alive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2vy8g1/who_was_the_last_person_to_know_all_of_mathematics/">knows all of mathematics</a>, no-one alive understands all the knowledge APIs that compose CPU production, or almost any other moderately complex field.</p><p>Every domain can be thought of in terms of the composition of knowledge APIs. An example that deviates from the more analytical examples given thus far would be the knowledge APIs of Basketball. Basketball players must learn the knowledge APIs of shooting, ball-handling and defending, each of which is composed of lower-level APIs, like free-throws, cross-over, and steal, to name a few. At an even lower level, basketball can be thought of as depending on the knowledge APIs of nutrition, and neuroplasticity that your brain undergoes through practice. Breaking down your current domain of interest into layers of knowledge APIs is a useful tool for introspection and evaluating what you need to improve on. Setting goals like "I need to get better at basketball" is shallow and hard to work with. But breaking down basketball into its various knowledge APIs and evaluating which of those you need to improve upon can yield much more tangible goals: "I need to increase the speed of my cross-over and improve my help-defense".</p><p>Experiment with different knowledge APIs, invest time into finding one that interests you, then start working towards mastery with that knowledge API. Don't be disheartened by the fact that you don't understand the implementation details of your knowledge API's dependencies, no-one does.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer)">Jim Keller</a>&nbsp;co-authored the design of the x86-64 CPU architecture without understanding the implementation details of how the CPU is actually manufactured. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers">Russo brothers</a>&nbsp;directed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies/avengers-infinity-war">Infinity War</a>&nbsp;without understanding the implementation details of VFX, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabib_Nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>&nbsp;had one of the most dominant careers in mma history without understanding the implementation details of nutrition or the neuroplasticity of training.</p><p>Knowledge APIs exist in every domain. Thinking about knowledge as an API, and accepting that APIs can be useful without understanding their implementation details, or the implementation details of their dependencies, can be a reassuring call to action.</p><p>I hope this essay has added a useful mental model to your intellectual toolbox. 🧠 🧰</p></article></div></div>]]>

<p>After all the hype about the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry Pi</a>, I decided to set up my old Pi. I configured my Raspberry Pi to be a “Pi-Hole” (DNS server) for my home network, and I added a publicly routable interface to tunnel traffic back into my home network. Here’s some details about it:</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/pi-hole-admin-screen.png" alt="Pi Hole Admin Screen"></p>



<h2>What’s a DNS?</h2>

<p>You can’t actually connect to google.com, you can only connect to an IP address. In order to do a google search you need a way to turn a hostname (google.com) into an ip address (<code>64.233.185.101</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/isp-dns.png" alt="Basic DNS"></p>

<h2>Why not use <code>$ISP</code>’s DNS?</h2>

<p>My ISP provides DNS services to my network as part of my internet package. ISPs also fought very hard in congress so they could sell your DNS query logs for money. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/dns-over-https-will-give-you-back-privacy-congress-big-isp-backing-took-away">Relevant EFF</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/isp-selling-dns-logs.png" alt="ISP selling DNS records"></p>



<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> is a self hosted DNS server. Pi-Hole lets you have programmable control over how DNS is resolved on your network.</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/pi-hole-basic-dns.png" alt="Pi Hole Doing DNS"></p>

<h2>Ad Servers? Never Heard of ‘em (<em>wink</em>, <em>wink</em>)</h2>

<p>One of the best features of Pi-Hole is that you can use it to block ad servers from being resolved on your network.</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/pi-hole-sketchy-ads.png" alt="Pi Hole Blocking Ad Servers"></p>



<p>Some good links</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3299438/dhcp-defined-and-how-it-works.html">Network World Article</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S43CFcpOZSI">CertBros Video</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) DHCP protocol is how a device that is joining the network, learns about the network.</p>

<p>While performing the handshake a device learns the following things</p>

<ol>
<li>What IP address it has a “lease” for</li>
<li>Where the gateway is</li>
<li>How to resolve DNS</li>
</ol>


<p>The router we rent from $ISP handles DHCP usually, but won’t let you configure DNS. In order to tell everyone on the network to use the Pi-Hole for DNS with this router, we need to have the Pi-Hole be the DHCP server.</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/pi-hole-dhcp.png" alt="Pi-Hole DHCP Settings"></p>



<p>Since my Pi-Hole is now the DHCP server for the network, that means that if it’s broken, the network is effectively “down” from the perspective of my roommates. I want to be able to connect to the pi hole/router wherever I am. This is a little tough because I don’t have a static IP address. At any point the external address of my router relative to the internet could change.</p>

<p>One option available to me is to use something like <a href="https://account.dyn.com/">DYN DNS</a>. Dyn DNS allows for your network to dynamically configure it’s external DNS address</p>

<p>But the issue is that Dyn DNS is $55 a year, which is like a ¼ of a <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro">Pinebook</a>.</p>

<h2>Cryptography to the Rescue</h2>

<p>One approach to providing a way to route to my server without having an static IP is to use one of the volunteer run cryptographic overlay networks.</p>

<p>Here are two.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29">Tor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">i2p</a></li>
</ol>


<p>When exposing a server to inbound connections via something like Tor, all connections from your server are outgoing to the Tor network. This means that you can make a server routable on any network that allows outgoing connections on port 443 (pretty much any network).</p>

<p>These cryptographic overlay networks use cryptographic signatures to route within the network. Addresses look like <code>http://bbcnewsv2vjtpsuy.onion</code>.The new Onion addresses are actually the public keys of the servers (the old ones were the beginning of the hash of the key). Since routing is done with cryptographically, you don’t need something like a lease on the limited IPv4 address space.</p>

<p>On the PI (I’ve named it “Io” after Jupiter’s moon) we can expose the SSH server via Tor by using the following configuration. We tell the Tor process to forward connections incoming connections on port 22 to port 22 on the loopback (localhost)</p>

<pre><code>RunAsDaemon 1
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh_hs/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/io-tor-connection.png" alt="IO Tor Hidden Service"></p>

<h2>Connecting my Laptop to Tor</h2>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro">special version of Firefox</a> that ships configured with all the necessary software to connect to the network. When you run the browser, it also runs a SOCKS5 proxy on port <code>9150</code> that any other software can use.</p>

<p>On my laptop I can tell <code>ssh</code> to proxy commands through the Socks5 Proxy by editing my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> like so</p>

<pre><code>Host io
  Hostname &lt;your-onion-address&gt;.onion
  User pi
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ProxyCommand nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p
  VerifyHostKeyDNS no
  CheckHostIP no
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p><i>Note: I found out the hard way, currently only the BSD edition of <code>netcat</code> supports SOCKS5, and the GNU version does not</i></p>

<p>Most commands that deal with connecting to a server read the <code>~/ssh/config</code> file. So <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code> work out of the box with this config</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/io-tor-ssh.png" alt="IO Tor ssh"></p>

<h2>Tunneling</h2>

<p>Now that we have a way to do ssh connections over the overlay network, we can use ssh to tunnel to other places behind my firewall.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:4000:192.168.1.64:80 io
</code></pre>

<p>This will forward all connections to port <code>4000</code> on your local machines through Io to port 80 on  <code>192.168.1.64</code> (relative to Io). This means I can use chrome to access my router anywhere I go.</p>

<p>You can use this tunneling trick to get to whatever IP address is blocked on whatever network you’re currently on.</p>

<p><img src="https://hmlhml.com/images/io-tor-ssh-tunnel.png" alt="IO Tor ssh tunnel"></p>

<h2>Like Water on a Rock</h2>

<p>Any article about exposing an SSH server should come with the mandatory “Make sure you follow all the SSH hardening guidelines.” If you’re planning on exposing your Pi to <em>ANY</em> network make sure you’ve updated the passwords to something secure. Ideally only allow ssh key login.</p>

	Back to <span itemprop="publisher">Cypress</span> blog
</a></p><div><p>On Wednesday, we <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cypressio-raises-40m-in-series-b-to-deliver-the-next-era-of-software-testing-301194275.html">announced</a> a $40M Series B round of funding led by OpenView Venture Partners. </p><p>OpenView’s deep domain expertise in product led growth and developer tools made them a great fit for us. We’re thrilled to add Blake Bartlett, Partner at OpenView, to our Board of Directors. We’re confident with the support of Blake and the OpenView team, we’ll successfully navigate the next stages of expansion.</p></div><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h2><div><p>In the last year, we’ve shipped a <a href="https://www.cypress.io/whats-new">host of new features</a> such as cross-browser testing, a brand new <a href="https://on.cypress.io/intercept">cy.intercept()</a> command to modify any kind of network request, and many new analytics and features in our Dashboard. </p><p>This funding will further accelerate our product roadmap. Cypress has been working hard behind the scenes to bring innovation into two other areas of testing.</p></div><p>The top priorities include:</p><ul><li><strong>Expanding the open source test runner for more testing types</strong>. 	Cypress will expand its open source product by offering developers the ability to write new types of tests. While we currently allow users to write end-to-end and browser-based integration tests, we’ve been working for the last year to add both unit testing (in Node.js) and component testing (in the browser). Component testing will borrow from the existing principles already present in Cypress, but give users the power and flexibility to mount components directly from your source code without running/booting/spawning a server. Additionally, unit testing focuses purely on Node.js tests, enabling users to write any kind of backend test with the power, insight, and visibility that’s missing today. Expect to hear more details of these launches in the upcoming months.<br></li><li><strong>Enhancing the Dashboard</strong>. Our companion <a href="https://cypress.io/dashboard">Dashboard Service</a> will continue to expand its capabilities to help maintain, manage, debug, and orchestrate running your tests. Expect to see new features such as test prioritization, test burn-in, Jira integration, and a unification of all your recorded tests across all testing types. We’re also exploring the opportunity for Cypress to report on code coverage, visual screenshot testing, and additional insights and analytics as part of making our commercial service even more powerful.</li></ul><h2 id="join-the-team">Join the Team</h2><p><a href="https://www.cypress.io/jobs/">We’re hiring</a> across engineering, developer experience, product managers, success engineers, technical account managers, community support, sales, data science, and more. You’d be joining a team and community of passionate people leading the industry in building world-class open source tools and commercial services that developers love. <br></p><h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2><p>This financing is a huge milestone for Cypress. Getting to this point would not have been possible without the dedication of the entire Cypress team, our users, customers, community, open source developers, and investors. Brian and I want to express our sincere gratitude for their efforts and support, all of which make Cypress possible. Thank you for investing in making Cypress better for everyone, and helping to grow and foster a community that’s thriving.</p>

While our main use case is helping people build environments for their applications, anything that runs in Docker will run easily on Release.</p><p>Early on, I found a handful of repos that helped us build out our platform. One that has been the most fun all along is the <a href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">docker-minecraft-server from itzg</a>. I used it in the early days because it had a little complexity and a fully working docker-compose ecosystem to play around with. It’s got the great side effect of when it runs, I let my kids test it out!</p><p>So while you’re sipping on egg nog and enjoying a 2020 Holiday season on COVID lock-down, here’s a walkthrough of how to get your very own free Minecraft server up and running on Release.&nbsp;</p><p>I highly recommend following along on the video tutorial. I’ve included step by step instructions for anyone that learns better through reading or if you’re confused about a step.</p><p>If you want to see a live version of this setup, we fired up our own Minecraft server that we built using these steps. So if you’re bored over the Holidays, pop in and say hello! Here’s our Server name if you want to say hi.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Play Minecraft With Us on the Release Team Minecraft Server</strong></p><p><strong>team-release-minecraft.releaseapp.io</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="full-video-walkthrough-of-this-tutorial">Full video walkthrough of this tutorial</h2><h2 id="detailed-instructions-to-get-your-minecraft-server-up-and-running">Detailed instructions to get your Minecraft Server up and running</h2><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>At the time of this writing, we have a <a href="https://releaseapp.io/pricing-page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Starter” plan</a> that’s free so you can give this a shot and have some Holiday fun on Release. Since we’re hosting all of the environments on Release on the starter plan we have a limitation of 2Gb/container. That’s sufficient for a Minecraft server for your kids and their friends.</p><p>To get started, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/awesome-release/docker-minecraft-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/awesome-release/docker-minecraft-server</a>, which we cloned from <a href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">itzg</a>. Fork or clone this repo into your GitHub account so you’ve got your own version of it to play around with.</p><p>Once you’ve got your own repo to work with, I recommend taking a quick read through the <a href="https://github.com/awesome-release/docker-minecraft-server/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">README</a>, there are a lot of configuration options and the documentation is extremely well done.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re also going to use the <a href="https://github.com/rcon-web-admin/rcon-web-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rcon Web Administrative portal. Take a look at the documentation</a>, <em>specifically the environment variables that can be configured.</em> itzg made a version of this for Docker called <a href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-rcon-web-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">docker-rcon-web-admin</a> that we are using when when we load the rcon and rcon-ws services in this tutorial.</p><p>For this walkthrough, we’re going to bring up a vanilla Minecraft server with an Rcon administrative portal running in a standalone container. This will let you and your kids have full control over the Minecraft server and ban friends who can’t fight off Zombie Pig Men.  Here’s an overview of what the system architecture looks like.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/2wNwcLD1zGZRa5lebjeTtx/1f910bef3c2f3b07bdb076b6185493f9/Screen_Shot_2020-12-14_at_4.50.14_PM.png" alt="High level overview of Minecraft with Rcon"></p><p>The master branch of this repo is already setup to work with this docker-compose file in Release.

December 17, 2020 | https://marcel.is/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repo/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://marcel.is/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repo/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I use <a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">dotfiles</a> to configure my environment.
I had the dotfiles stored in a git repo and used helper scripts to create symlinks in my <code>$HOME</code> directory. However, adding &amp; updating the dotfiles felt cumbersome, like a pebble in a shoe.</p>
<p>Recently, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles">this article</a>, which was inspired by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797">this HN comment</a>. They mention something called a <em>bare</em> git repo to manage dotfiles. I have never heard of it &amp; it took me a while to figure it out. So I thought I will share it here.</p>
<h2>How a typical git repo looks like</h2>
<p>Typically, when you initialize or clone a git repo, it consists of two parts: <em>the working tree</em> and <em>the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain#ch10-git-internals"> <code>.git</code> directory</a></em>. The working tree contains things like source code and the README. The <code>.git</code> directory contains <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">git internals</a>, such as commit objects, local git config, and hooks. For example, when you checkout a different branch, git updates the <em>working tree</em> based on data stored in the <code>.git</code> directory.</p>
<p><img src="https://marcel.is/img/bare-repo-typical.png" alt="bare-repo-typical"></p>
<h2>Cumbersome symlinking</h2>
<p>Now, when symlinking dotfiles, the working tree for dotfiles is located in the dotfiles git directory, not in <code>$HOME</code>. So to make dotfiles work, one needs to create symlinks. And the symlinks need to be managed. That's the pebble.</p>
<p><img src="https://marcel.is/img/bare-repo-symlinks.png" alt="bare-repo-symlinks"></p>
<p>You may wonder why not initialize a git repo directly in  <code>$HOME</code>? If git doesn't find the <code>.git</code> directory in the current directory, it continues the search in parent directories. So if a directory is not versioned, git would still assume we are in the dotfile git repo. That could be confusing &amp; prone to errors.</p>
<p>If only there would be a way to put the  dotfiles working tree directly in <code>$HOME</code>, while keeping the <code>.git</code> directory separated.</p>
<h2>Say hello to bare repositories</h2>
<p>It turns out there is a way: a <em>bare</em> git repository. A bare git repo is a repo that contains only the content of the <code>.git</code> directory, not the working tree. When interacting with git, you specify the working tree directory as a command-line parameter. That's pretty nice.</p>
<p><img src="https://marcel.is/img/bare-repository.png" alt="bare-repository"></p>
<p>Technically, it's done like this.</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>DOTFILES</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/projects/dotfiles.git


$ <span>git</span> init --bare <span>$DOTFILES</span>




$ <span>alias</span> <span>gitdf</span><span>=</span><span>'git --git-dir=<span>$DOTFILES</span> --work-tree=<span>$HOME</span>'</span>


$ gitdf config status.showUntrackedFiles no


$ <span>echo</span> <span>"syntax on"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> .vimrc
$ gitdf <span>add</span> .vimrc
$ gitdf commit 
</code></pre>
<p>I've been using this setup for a few days now, and it feels smoother. I like it.</p>
<h2>Further reading</h2>
<p>Here I focus on the high-level concept. If you want to read more about the technical workings, checkout <a href="http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ackama.com/blog/posts/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained">this</a> post.</p>
<p>Additionally, it turns out that git supports <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">multiple working trees</a> in one git repository. See the <code>git-worktree</code>. Interesting, I haven't used it yet.</p>
<h2>Side note on complexity</h2>
<p>I now try to see everything through the eyes of <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Rich Hickey's Simple Made Easy</a> &amp; to spot complexity. The dotfiles use case is, perhaps, more of a theoretical exercise, but I find it valuable nevertheless. By doing thought experiments like this, I aim to solidify my understanding of complexity.</p>
<p>So, in this case, it seems that the symlinking approach complects two things: the dotfiles (the <code>.gitconfig</code>, the <code>.zshrc</code>) with the dotfile management (symlinks). These are two different concepts, intertwined in one repository. With a bare repository, we remove the complexity: the dotfiles are taken care of by the working tree, while dotfiles management is taken care of by git.</p>
<p><img src="https://marcel.is/img/bare-repo-complexity.png" alt="bare-repo-complexity"></p>
<p>Another form of complexity is the imperative code for symlinking: first symlink that, then symlink that. At least that's how I had it coded. Since imperative programming complects <em>how</em> with <em>what</em>, it's complex. With a bare repository, we remove this form of complexity: the dotfiles become declarative; it's only the <em>what</em>.</p>
<p>There is one tradeoff, though. We introduce complexity in the form of inconsistent interaction with git. For dotfiles, we use an alias, such as <code>gitdf</code>; while for all other repos, we use <code>git</code>. For me, this complexity is negligible compared to the benefit of simplifying the symlinking process.</p></div></div>]]>

Our responsiveness on issues and pull requests is now much better, developers get new releases on a regular basis, and we also have the opportunity to work on new investments in the area of React Native Open Source. A prominent example of such an investment is the work on the next iteration of the Reanimated library (<a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.swmansion.com/introducing-reanimated-2-752b913af8b3">read more in the announcement post</a>). But we constantly seek out for new ways to contribute our skills to the development of React Native platform and its ecosystem, and it feels like the best way to do so in our position is to undertake new projects and experiment with some ideas that we have. In this post, I want to share the story of one such experiment we decided to try out recently and the lesson we learned from it — the experiment was about building a SwiftUI-backed renderer for React Native.</p><p id="cbe7">Ever since React became mainstream we have observed a trend of new UI systems being designed around very similar, declarative principles. This trend goes beyond JavaScript frameworks, and recently reached the native mobile ecosystem with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" rel="noopener">SwiftUI</a> (by Apple) and <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose" rel="noopener">Jetpack Compose</a> (for Android) being the new contenders for becoming the default UI systems for their corresponding platforms.</p><p id="95a3">We believe that React Native will need to adapt to those new ways of interacting with the platform-specific native UI APIs — the problem here is that there are many different ways of approaching such an integration, and none of them seemed trivial to us. React has been designed to work with tree-based UI systems (e.g., DOM, Android’s view system, UIKit, AppKit) by performing direct tree manipulations like adding new nodes or changing node attributes. With SwiftUI we no longer interface with the UI tree structure directly, and in fact the underlying tree does not even need to exist in some cases. This means that in React Native we can no longer hold references to native view instances and further use these references to make updates to the UI.</p><p id="bee7">With a number of different ideas in mind, we decided to build a prototype implementation of the SwiftUI renderer for React Native — a drop-in replacement for the core’s UIKit renderer which may allow us to remove the dependency on UIKit altogether. It is important to note that embedding custom SwiftUI components in React Native is already possible (this can be done using a “hosting” container where components written with SwiftUI can be placed as a part of the UIKit view structure — we recommend <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/react-native-meets-swiftui-d1606a8e1681" rel="noopener">this great post by Alexey Kureev</a> which covers this approach). However, building a React Native renderer is a completely different thing that opens up a new set of possibilities and not only brings full control over how all view primitives are rendered, but also allows to freely build nested hierarchies of such views.</p><p id="e9ed">SwiftUI is a declarative UI framework introduced by Apple in 2019. The keyword “declarative” makes it sound similar to React, doesn’t it? Behind the scenes, SwiftUI follows the same principles as React and React Native, especially the reconciliation concept that makes the rendering engine only re-render those views whose state has changed.</p><p id="a84b">We are already seeing Apple invest heavily in unifying the software running on all of its platforms (and even hardware by switching Macs to ARM architecture). This also applies to the way they recommend developers build apps for these platforms. I wouldn’t be surprised if some new UI features come only to SwiftUI, just like how new features or frameworks are made available from Swift but not from Objective-C. Additionally, SwiftUI has some other advantages over UIKit:</p><ul><li id="5aaa">First-class support for all Apple platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and extensions such as iOS widgets or watchOS complications.</li><li id="b321">It provides many great perks right out of the box like handy built-in SVG-like shapes and visual effects such as shadows, masks, blurred views or even changing a view’s saturation.</li><li id="a15d">A more composable approach. Instead of having a base class (<code>UIView</code>) that is heavy and complex as it has to know how to handle a lot of different properties, SwiftUI uses lightweight primitive views responsible for applying only specific kinds of effects. Every view in SwiftUI is just a struct that implements the<code>View</code> protocol, thus we’re not dealing with any base class.</li><li id="e87d">A much easier and cleaner way to create custom native components. It’s as easy as writing a few lines of code.</li></ul><p id="a6cb">During this research I tried to cover some core, currently existing functionality of React Native. The goal was to build a functioning React Native app demo without relying on UIKit for rendering any views. Below I listed the steps that I have gone through as part of this project:</p><ul><li id="0f0a">Investigate how to integrate with Fabric and how to map shadow nodes to SwiftUI views instead of <code>UIView</code>s.</li><li id="4390">Use Yoga layout metrics to set the proper view size and offset.</li><li id="4017">Listen for shadow tree updates and update the UI accordingly.</li><li id="f186">Read component props passed from the JavaScript side and be able to use them in Swift.</li><li id="1638">Implement adding some basic styles like: background, color, border, and opacity.</li><li id="36ab">Deal with text and its frame size that we must calculate and pass on to Yoga. Native text view takes only as much space as it needs and so Yoga itself cannot measure it properly in a cross-platform manner.</li><li id="d9b8">Send native events to JavaScript using event emitters.</li><li id="e687">Implement some of the most commonly used components like <code>Button</code>, <code>ScrollView</code>, <code>Image</code> and <code>TextInput</code> to check how much of the existing functionality we’re able to cover.</li><li id="1142">Try out some SwiftUI features such as masking a view with another, adding a shadow to the view or adding a blur.</li></ul><p id="1f10">I managed to put all the bricks together and came up with a foundation that allows us to build and run a simple application with proper layout, some styling and interactions. As it would be too much for a single blog post to discuss the implementation details, in this article we only focus on the results and limitations that we discovered while we will share some more insights about the internals in the follow up blog post.</p><p id="5975">iOS 14.0 introduced a new kind of app extensions — widgets. It turns out that they don’t support the traditional way of making apps based on UIKit. Surprisingly, UIKit is available there, however, it’s impossible to use it for rendering, making them the first feature of iOS that is designed to only support SwiftUI as the UI framework. The lack of UIKit support means we cannot use React Native for building widgets, and even if we know how we can embed SwiftUI components within the React Native view tree that still wouldn’t help here. However, since widgets can’t be too complex visually (they occupy a small portion of the screen and aren’t really interactive), we would only have to expose a small number of SwiftUI components to React Native. This sounds easy, but it’s actually a long way off. The SwiftUI-based React Native rendering layer would work here, even if the main app were to use the standard React Native renderer.</p><p id="3fb8">Recently, Apple announced the Mac Catalyst project (also known as UIKitForMac) which enables developers to make iPad apps available for macOS users too. That is amazing and good enough for many projects that don’t have to care too much about this platform and don’t use any of its platform-specific features. However it was never meant to be a fully-fledged solution to developing macOS apps. Some people <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/131" rel="noopener">got it running in React Native</a> with a few modifications, but it isn’t going to be officially supported any time soon.</p><p id="97d0">I must applaud Microsoft for putting a lot of effort into creating and maintaining <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos" rel="noopener">react-native-macos</a> which is a react-native fork with a lot of patches that makes React Native work on macOS based on the OS native UI framework — AppKit. As it turned out, React Native uses UIKit framework in many more places than just the UI-related codebase, so I had to use some of those patches to make my SwiftUI renderer compile on this platform.</p><p id="112e">Life is real, nothing is ideal. With SwiftUI we gain a lot but lose something else. To put it bluntly—SwiftUI is still not as powerful as UIKit or AppKit and probably won’t be for the next few years.</p><p id="2225">For instance, I found it quite painful to work with text inputs (<code>TextField</code> in SwiftUI’s nomenclature). The only thing that can configured is the value and placeholder. It’s not possible to change the tappable area, get cursor position nor read text selection. To support multiline input we have to use <code>TextEditor</code> which doesn’t even let us know once something is changed. Moreover, triggering on-demand events such as <code>focus</code> or <code>blur</code> is not possible and most methods that we call on components’ refs have no counterparts in SwiftUI yet. Lastly, there is no way to scroll to a specific point in scroll views like you can in UIKit. Instead, we can only scroll to a subview by its identifier (although this may actually be a good thing because it’s what we usually want to do).</p><p id="33da">A SwiftUI renderer may be a good solution to bring React Native to more devices, with just one UI codebase used across all Apple platforms. Of course, it’s hard to predict the direction of SwiftUI development and how fast we’ll get to the point where using SwiftUI is a reasonable choice, but it’s always better to be prepared</p><p id="1ee2">Here is a sneak peek of a React Native app and a widget that I’ve been using as a playground, entirely rendered by SwiftUI. It presents all of the currently implemented functionality.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7053">In the next blogpost I’ll describe the technical side, show you some examples, and finally make the repository with our proof of concept public and open it for contributions.</p><p id="f25d">… to be continued soon.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

</ul>

<p>I’m pleased to finally have some results to show for a project I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last year or so.</p>

<p>The idea originated when I was trying to think of an interesting idea for a project to help me learn Verilog and FPGA design, and the notion of building a simple raytracer came to mind (partly inspired by a scarily smart friend of mine who is building his own GPU). A bit later - because sometimes my brain hates me and delights in coming up with silly things to do - this turned into “wouldn’t it be interesting to try making a SNES do raytracing?”, and thus the SuperRT chip idea was born.</p>

<p>What I wanted to try and do was something akin to the Super FX chip used in titles such as Star Fox, where the SNES runs the game logic and hands off a scene description to a chip in the cartridge to generate the visuals. To that end I’ve deliberately tried to restrict myself to just using a single custom chip for the design, not making use of the ARM core available on the DE10 board or any other external processing resources.</p>

<p>The end results look something like this:</p>

<p>Apologies for the poor screenshot quality, incidentally - for some reason my capture card produces terrible results when capturing from my SNES, so I had to resort to the good old “photograph the screen in a darkened room” approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Hardware.jpg" alt="SuperRT development hardware"></p>

<p>The Super Nintendo (technically a Super Famicom) seen here has had the case removed to make room for the cabling, but other than that is totally unmodified. Attached to it is the PCB from a copy of an <em>awful</em> Pachinko game I picked up for 100 yen at a local second-hand store, with the game ROM removed and replaced with a cable breakout. This then passes through a set of level shifters to convert the SNES’s 5v down to 3.3v and then into a DE10-Nano FPGA development board with a Cyclone V FPGA. The level shifter boards are anything but pretty - and assembling them was a nightmare thanks to the necessary ICs only being available in surface-mount packages - but they do the job.</p>

<p><img src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide3.jpg" alt="Hardware layout diagram"></p>

<p>The SuperRT chip constructs the scene using a specialised command language which is executed by one of three parallel execution units on the chip - essentially specialised CISC processors - to perform ray intersection tests. The scene description allows objects to be constructed using a subset of CSG operations, using spheres and planes as the basic building blocks and then performing OR, AND and subtraction operations using them to build up the desired geometry. AABBs are also supported, although primarily for use in culling tests (they can be rendered if desired, but they have a lower positional accuracy than other primitives and thus this is not generally very useful except for debugging purposes).</p>

<p>

  <source src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Artefact.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</p>

<p>The renderer casts up to four rays per screen pixel, calculating direct shadows from a directional light source and a single reflection bounce. Surfaces each have a diffuse colour and reflectivity property, and it’s possible to apply modifiers to these based on CSG results or specialised functions - this is used to generate the checkerboard pattern on the floor.</p>

<p><img src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide2.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The ray colour for each pixel is calculated by a “ray engine”, which handles the overall ray lifecycle and uses an “execution engine” module to run the command program describing the scene as many times as is required to resolve the ray. The command program itself is uploaded from the SNES and stored in a local 4K RAM buffer - animation is performed by writing modified commands into this buffer as required. A disassembled command buffer looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>0000 Start
0001 Plane 0, -1, 0, Dist=-2
0002 SphereSub OH 2, 1, 5, Rad=5
0003 SphereSub OH 4, 1, 4, Rad=4
0004 SphereSub OH 5, 1, 9, Rad=9
0005 SphereSub OH 2, 1, 2, Rad=2
0006 SphereSub OH -0.5, 1, 2, Rad=2
0007 RegisterHitNoReset 0, 248, 0, Reflectiveness=0
0008 Checkerboard ORH 48, 152, 48, Reflectiveness=0
0009 ResetHitState
0010 Plane 0, -1, 0, Dist=-2.150146
0011 RegisterHit 0, 0, 248, Reflectiveness=153
0012 AABB 4, -2.5, 11,    8, 3.5, 13
0013 ResetHitStateAndJump NH 44
0014 Origin 6, 2, 12
0015 Plane -0.2929688, 0, -0.9570313, Dist=0.2497559
0016 PlaneAnd OH 0.2919922, 0, 0.9560547, Dist=0.25
0017 PlaneAnd OH 0, 1, 0, Dist=1
0018 PlaneAnd OH 0, -1, 0, Dist=4
0019 PlaneAnd OH -0.9570313, 0, 0.2919922, Dist=-1
0020 PlaneAnd OH 0.9560547, 0, -0.2929688, Dist=1.499756
0021 RegisterHit 248, 0, 0, Reflectiveness=0
</code></pre>

<p>Each execution engine is a processor module with a 14 cycle pipeline, and in general one instruction is retired per cycle, so each execution unit can calculate about 50 million sphere, plane or AABB intersections per second. The exception to this is that branch operations have to flush the entire pipeline and thus have a  16 cycle overhead (14 cycles to flush the pipeline + 2 cycles instruction fetch delay). To try and avoid this as much as possible a branch prediction system is used - fortunately a lot of the time the spatial coherency of nearby rays means that a high prediction hit rate is achievable.</p>

<p><img src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide5.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>Intersections in the execution engine are carried out by two pipelines, one handling AABBs and the other spheres and planes. The system as a whole works exclusively using 32-bit integer maths in 18.14 fixed point format, with 16-bit (2.14) format used where values are known to be in the +-1 range, and the sphere/plane intersection pipeline has two dedicated additional maths units that calculate reciprocal and square root operations.</p>

</p>

<p>Once a frame is rendered, the PPU converter module turns the framebuffer into a format that can be DMAed directly to the SNES VRAM for display, reducing it to 256 colours and swizzling it into character tile bitplanes. The screen resolution is 200x160 - this results in exactly 32000 bytes of image data for a full frame, which is transferred to VRAM in two 16000 bytes chunks over successive frames due to bandwidth constraints. Thus the full image can only be refreshed once every two frames, effectively limiting the maximum framerate to 30FPS - although the test scene runs at closer to 20FPS (primarily due to some bottlenecks with the logic on the SNES side at present).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to the participants in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=20068">this thread</a> over at SNESdev for a lot of useful ideas on fullscreen expansion chip DMA that inspired the solution used here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide4.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The chip also implements a number of other basic functions - there is an interface to the SNES cartridge bus, along with a small program ROM holding 32K of code for the SNES (this is constrained by the fact that the interface board currently only connects up the SNES Address Bus A lines, and thus the effective usable address space is a mere 64K, of which 32K is used for memory-mapped IO registers to communicate with the SuperRT chip). There is also a multiplication accelerator unit that lets the SNES perform 16x16bit multiply operations rapidly.</p>

<p><img src="https://shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Shot13.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>For debugging, I used the HDMI interface on the DE10 board to output data to a second monitor, along with a Megadrive joypad connected to the GPIO pins to manipulate the debug system. Resource constraints mean that this has to be disabled if all three ray engine cores are enabled, however.</p>

<p>So that’s a broad overview of the system - I intend to post some articles giving more details of how individual components work in the near future. In the meantime, though, if you have any questions or thoughts then please get in touch and I’ll do my best to answer!</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matt, Jaymin, Rick and everyone else who has helped with advice, inspiration and support!</p>

<p><span>There is a war going on for your mind</span></p>

<p>Doesn’t it feel like it?</p>

<p>Each time you step onto the Internet you enter into a battlefield where all the opposing forces are fighting for that most valuable prize: your attention.</p>

<p>There are bullets shot in this war, but they are of a different sort.</p>

<p>The artillery barrages of old have been replaced by the incessant bombardment of messages and notifications. Instead of subterfuge and espionage, you have to defend yourself against a myriad of dark user experience patterns designed to get you to do things that are not in your interest - but are very much in the interest of the companies that employ them.</p>

<p><span>It is you against them, and it’s not a fair fight.</span></p>

<p>Just as your attention is important to those companies, it is even more so to you. In fact, I would go so far as saying your attention is your most valuable asset.</p>

<p>Think of it this way.</p>

<p>If you’re not able to direct your attention to get things done, you could be the smartest person in the world and it wouldn’t matter one bit. You’d just waste all your raw intellect capacity by spending your days playing videogames and refreshing Twitter.</p>

<p>However, if you were able to focus your mind and do what needs to be done, you’d be able to wring every drop of value from the intellectual firepower you do have and run circles around the genius whose mind is always chasing butterflies.</p>

<p><span>Attention is multiplicative with productivity.</span> Without the first, you can’t have the latter.</p>

<p>Now, I’m under no impression that this idea that your ability to focus your attention is the most valuable asset you can develop is new, or innovative or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>Deep down, we all know this. We have all felt in our bones what it’s like when we’re not in control of our minds, when our attention, our focus, is repeatedly being yanked away from us by the constant stream of messages and notifications, alongside the tantalizing allure of the many websites and apps whose primary goal is for us to ignore the world outside so we can keep in using them.</p>

<p>What’s more, <span>we also know how to fight back against it.</span></p>

<p>We know we check our phones too much and should leave them in another room when we want to be productive. We know we should sign off all our social media accounts, perhaps even install one of those programs that block distracting websites.</p>

<p>I’m not here to tell you what you already know and have read elsewhere, but I do want to share with you instead a little tool that has helped me, and might help you, regain your focus.</p>

<p>That tool?</p>

<p><span>The adblocker.</span></p>

<p>That’s right. The regular old trustworthy adblocker.</p>

<p>Now, most people who use an adblocker only use it to block, well, ads. But this helpful tool has a feature that I haven’t seen many people talk about.</p>

<p>And that feature is that not only can your adblocker block ads, but it can also block whichever part of a website you tell it to block.</p>

<p>Don’t want to see that pesky <em>“who to follow”</em> sidebar on Twitter?</p>

<p><span>Block it.</span></p>

<p>Don’t want to see all those videos Youtube says you should watch?</p>

<p><span>Block them.</span></p>

<p>Because it can be used to block anything and everything on a website, the adblocker is one of the best tools you can have in the war against distraction, and chances are, you already have it installed in your browser, ready to go. You just didn’t know you could use it this way.</p>

<p>It’s quite simple actually.</p>

<p>First off, if you don’t have uBlock installed on your browser, do so. You can find it for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Chrome here</a>, and for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox here</a>.</p>

<p>Now go to a website where you want to block something that’s constantly snatching your attention away from you.</p>

<p>For me this is Youtube. I love Youtube, but its algorithms are too good. I can spend hours going through video after video non-stop like a zombie searching for brains, and it’s time I stop doing that. I could try to exercise self-control, but that’s leaving it to chance. Instead, I’ll just use the adblocker uBlock to… hmm, block it.</p>

<p>Because I don’t want to run the risk of getting distracted each time I open Youtube, a logical place to start is to make that list of videos that Youtube greets us with not appear. There are multiple supercomputers behind Youtube built solely with the purpose of showing me videos that they think will get me to continue using it, so if I don’t see any of them I will be protected against it.</p>

<p>Let’s say you think that’s a good idea and want to do it for yourself as well, how would you go about it?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c421ab7328f4a77bd844db4d81a0ad5134022f6/5ddc1/assets/images/usinganadblocker/adblocker.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>First, right-click the part of the page you want to block. In this case that is the main page, where all the videos show up. Then select “Block Element”. When you do so, a small window will appear in the bottom-left corner of your screen, and uBlock will color the section you’ve told it to block in red.</p>

<p>If when you do this uBlock selects the wrong part of the page, you can adjust it by moving the cursor and clicking once elsewhere. This will allow you to choose what you want to block once more.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve selected the part of the website you want to block with uBlock, all you have to do now is click where it says “Create” on the small window at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>And voila, you’ve now added some shielding between your mind and an Internet that’s out to get it.</p>

<p>Easy as that.</p>

<p>You can use this process to block parts of other websites that continuously tantalize your attention, and as you accumulate these you’ll create an Internet that works for you rather than against you. Instead of jumping straight into a minefield each time you open your browser, you can be safe in knowing that you’ve diffused the mines and they won’t blow up in your face.</p>

<p>It’s an unorthodox use of an adblocker, I’ll give you that, but this process has been key in my own attempts at maintaining control of my focus and attention as I navigate across the web, and I now hope you can use this to help in your as well.</p>

<p>It may sometimes happen that you block something you didn’t mean to. You can, by accident, make it so that you can’t use Youtube at all because you’ve blocked the entire website from showing. Ups.</p>

<p>If you blocked something you didn’t mean to, click on the uBlock icon in your browser and select the rightmost icon at the bottom where it says “Open the dashboard.”</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dfc70657b6aa37c10c12b77c500e26b16e8cc84f/3fb4f/assets/images/usinganadblocker/adblock_opendashboard.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>There, look for the “My filters” tab. This will open what amounts to a text file with all the filters you created. Each line includes the URL of the websites they apply to, so to reverse a mistake you need only delete the appropriate line.</p>

<p>If you have multiple lines related to a single website, it might just be easier to delete all of them, which will bring that website to its original state, without anything being blocked, and start from scratch.</p>

<p>BERGEN/OSLO (Dagbladet): She is the festival director of the Bergen International Literary Festival (LitFestBergen). One of the highlights of the 2019 festival was scheduled for that afternoon.</p><p>Four months had passed since the assassination of journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, carried out by agents of the Saudi Arabian government in Istanbul. Participants at the festival included female artists from two authoritarian regimes who were scheduled to discuss how they managed to practice their craft in two oppressive countries – one of which was Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Two artists were on the programme.</p><p><strong>Only one turned up.</strong></p><h2>Kept secret</h2><p>The drama that ensued in Bergen has been kept a secret for nearly two years. Dagbladet has now confirmed the incident from several sources.</p><div id="parallax-73170119">

<p>For the artist's own safety, Dagbladet has chosen not to identify her by name. She has become well-known, partly because she dares to criticize the role of religious authorities in Saudi Arabia through her art. The artist was present on the opening day of the festival and was scheduled to participate in two new panel discussions. The next day, however, she was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>- What happened was that she failed to appear for her first stage discussion. We were concerned when she didn’t turn up, says Teresa Grøtan to Dagbladet.</p><h2>Police search</h2><p>- At first, I couldn’t reach her on the phone. Then she said she would come, but that she had gotten lost. I asked her to tell me where she was, and I said I would come and pick her up. Then she didn’t answer her phone and turned her phone off. We realised something was wrong and contacted the police, who began searching for her.</p><p>Dagbladet has recently revealed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened when Saudi Arabia requested that Norway regdiplomatic immunity to a security team of ten men, who work for the oil-rich Kingdom's embassy in Oslo. Both the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PST (the Norwegian Police Security Service) were involved in the case. It ended with Norway refusing to grant diplomat status to nine of the ten security people.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) connected the incident with Iyad el-Baghdadi, a known Saudi dissident, and a friend of the assassinated Jamal Khashoggi. He currently resides at an unknown address in Norway.</p>

<p>According to the festival director, Embassy personnel arrived so early on Friday, that they likely started driving just after the artist had participated in the official opening, making a journey across the mountains during the night.</p>
<p><strong>- I was told she had been visited at the hotel and threatened by representatives of the Saudi Arabia Embassy, Grøtan told Dagbladet.</strong></p><p>- They had gone to her hotel, threatened her, told her not to participate, and instead return home to Saudi Arabia.</p><p><em>- Did you notice anything?</em></p><p>- She did ask for her fee in cash – but I had no idea why. She also left her mobile phone behind before returning to Saudi Arabia.</p><h2>Investigation by Norwegian Police Security Service (PST)</h2><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p><strong>The Western Norway Police District in Bergen have confirmed, in a statement to Dagbladet, that they participated in the search for the artist. In an email to Dagbladet, Communication Consultant Gry Benedicte Halseth from Western Norway Police District responded as follows:</strong></p>
<p>- The police log is exempt from public disclosure, so we cannot give you that. We can confirm that the management of the literary festival contacted the police, and that we had contact with the organiser and the hotel where the lecturer stayed, until she returned to the hotel just two hours after police were alerted. Any questions about the investigation must be directed to the central PST office.</p><article>

</article>
<p><strong>Norwegian Police Security Service has declined to comment on this specific case. However, Senior Advisor Martin Bernsen with PST told Dagbladet:</strong></p><p>- I do not wish to go into detail on what we may have initiated in terms of operative and preventive measures in this case. Generally, the activity Dagbladet describes is related to what we refer to as refugee espionage. The purpose of this type of activity is to undermine, neutralise or eliminate political opposition. There are several countries involved in refugee espionage here in Norway. Threatening people who are living in Norway, or their families in their native countries, is a common procedure. Refugee espionage is something PST has worked to prevent and investigate. There are few known examples, since these cases are often difficult to prosecute, and we assume that there are many unrecorded cases.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

</blockquote>
<p>Many governments and other well-resourced actors around the world implement some form of censorship to assert control over the flow of information on the Internet, either because it is deemed “sensitive” or because it is inconvenient for those with power.</p>
<p>Suppose there is some adversary, Eve, that wants to prevent users from accessing some content. There are many ways of implementing such censorship but they broadly fall into one of two categories: <strong>endpoint-based</strong> or <strong>flow-fingerprinting</strong> attacks.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://spacetime.dev/assets/images/rosen-isp-model.png" alt="A user attempting to access censored material through an adversarial Internet service provider." width="60%"></p><center><p>A user attempting to access censored material through an adversarial Internet service provider.</p></center>
</div>
<p>Eve could maintain a list of banned services and refuse to serve any network request she receives if it is on this list. Here Eve is deciding based on the <em>destination</em> of the request: this is endpoint-based censorship. In response a user, Alice, could use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a> to disguise the destination so that from Eve’s perspective, the destination will appear to be the VPN server or the TOR entry node instead of the censored service.</p>
<p>This is a working solution in many places, but Eve is not beaten. In response she can add the IP addresses of known VPN providers as well as <a href="https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes">public TOR nodes</a> to her blocklist, reasoning that only a user who wants to bypass her blocking efforts would use these services. Alice could then setup her own VPN server or access the TOR network through a non-public <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en">TOR bridge</a> that is not blocked.</p>
<p>Eve could actively probe the servers that Alice connects to in order to find out if they are TOR entry nodes, for example, but apart from this she has stretched endpoint-based censorship to its limits. An alternative is to censor a connection based on characteristics of the network flow instead of its destination: this is flow-fingerprinting. This is usually accomplished using some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection</a> engine that can detect and group traffic into protocols and applications. With this capability Eve can block any traffic that is detected as a proxy regardless of whether any particular server is known.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://spacetime.dev/assets/images/rosen-dpi-layout.png" alt="An adversary using a deep packet inspection engine to decide whether to censor traffic." width="60%"></p><center><p>An adversary using a deep packet inspection engine to decide whether to censor traffic.</p></center>
</div>
<p>To bypass this technique, Alice must disguise the fingerprint of her traffic so that a DPI engine does not classify it as a blocked protocol or application. There are a few approaches to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomisation</strong>. The goal here is to make the traffic look indistinguishable from randomness, or put another way, to make it look like “nothing”. This would successfully hide which category traffic belongs to, but a lack of a fingerprint is a fingerprint itself and that’s a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Examples of randomising obfuscators include <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/obfsproxy-next-step-censorship-arms-race">Obfsproxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NullHypothesis/scramblesuit">ScrambleSuit</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mimicry</strong>. Instead of making traffic look like random noise, mimicry-based obfuscation makes packets look like they belong to a specific protocol or application that is assumed to be unblocked. For example, <a href="https://sri-csl.github.io/stegotorus/">StegoTorus</a> and <a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2012/cacr2012-08.pdf">SkypeMorph</a> produce traffic that looks like HTTP and Skype, respectively, but they are prohibitively slow.</p>
<p>Another option is <a href="https://libfte.org/">LibFTE</a> which is roughly a cryptographic cipher that produces ciphertext conforming to a given regular expression. DPI engines also commonly use regular expressions so with LibFTE it is possible to precisely force misclassification of a protocol.</p>
<p>Mimicry only tries to make packet payloads look like some cover protocol and so the syntax and semantics of the overall network flow can deviate substantially from the protocol specification or any known implementation. This makes mimicry-based obfuscators <a href="https://kpdyer.com/publications/ccs2015-measurement.pdf">easily detectable</a> and results in the approach being <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6547102">fundamentally flawed</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tunnelling</strong>. A tunnelling obfuscator encapsulates traffic within some cover protocol using an actual implementation of the cover protocol instead of simply trying to mimic the way its packets look. An example is <a href="https://github.com/arlolra/meek">meek</a> which uses HTTPS to communicate between the client and the server and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting">domain fronting</a> to hide the true destination of the traffic, but since domain fronting relied on an undocumented feature of major CDNs, it no longer works.</p>
<p>Tunnelling obfuscators have to be careful to look like a specific and commonly used implementation of a cover protocol since a custom implementation may be distinguishable. China and Iran managed to distinguish TOR TLS and non-TOR TLS first-hop connections even though TOR used a real implementation of TLS to tunnel traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An important metric to consider is the <strong>false positive</strong> detection rate associated with each method. This is the proportion of traffic that a DPI engine falsely detects as coming from an obfuscation tool. A high false-positive rate results in lots of innocent traffic being blocked which will cause frustration for ordinary users. Therefore the goal of an obfuscator should be to look as much like innocent traffic as possible to maximise the “collateral damage” of any attempted censorship. Overall, it seems like tunnelling is the best approach.</p>
<p>This brings us to <a href="https://github.com/awnumar/rosen">Rosen</a>, a modular, tunnelling proxy that I have developed as part of my ongoing masters thesis. It currently only implements HTTPS as a cover protocol, but this has been tested against <a href="https://github.com/ntop/nDPI">nDPI</a> and a commercial DPI engine developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto_Networks">Palo Alto Networks</a>, <strong>both of which detected TOR traffic encapsulated by Rosen as ordinary HTTPS</strong>. The goals of Rosen are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unobservability</strong>. It should be difficult to distinguish obfuscated traffic from innocent background traffic using the same protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoint-fingerprinting resistance</strong>. It should be difficult to use active probing to ascertain that a given server is actually a proxy server. This is accomplished by responding as a proxy if and only if a valid key is provided and falling back to some default behaviour otherwise. For example, the HTTPS implementation serves some static content in this case.</li>
<li><strong>Modularity</strong>. It should be relatively easy to add support for another cover protocol or configure the behaviour of an existing protocol to adapt to changing adversarial conditions. This is facilitated by a modular architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>. It should be possible to route most application traffic through the proxy. This is why a SOCKS interface was chosen, but TUN support is also a goal.</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong>. It should be easy to use.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p><img src="https://spacetime.dev/assets/images/rosen-high-level.png" alt="High-level overview of Rosen's architecture." width="75%"></p><center><p>High-level overview of Rosen's architecture.</p></center>
</div>
<p>HTTPS was chosen as the first cover protocol to be implemented as it provides confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity; and it is ubiquitous on the Internet making it infeasible for an adversary to block. The implementation is provided by the Go standard library and most configuration options are set to their defaults so that it blends in with other applications. There is a option to disable TLS 1.3 as it <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/11/china_blocking_tls_1_3_esni/">could be blocked by some nation-state firewalls</a>. The server will automatically provision a TLS certificate from LetsEncrypt and the client pins <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">LetsEncrypt’s root</a> by default.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to know how effective this truly is without further battle-testing by security researchers and users, but we can theorise to some extent.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Endpoint-based censorship</strong>. Users are able to setup Rosen on their own servers behind their own domains so there is no generic firewall rule that can block all of them. An adversary could instead try to actively probe a Rosen server in order to detect it.</p>
<p>One option is to provide a key and detect a timing difference as the server checks it. The delta I measured between providing a 32 byte key and not providing a key is 29ns (on an AMD Ryzen 3700X). Since network requests have a latency in the milliseconds, I assume this attack is practically infeasible.</p>
<p>A simpler attack is to look at the static files that the HTTPS server responds with. If the user does not replace the default files with their own, an easy distinguishing attack is possible. This could be easier to avoid with a different protocol. For example, if an incorrect SSH password is provided to an SSH server, it simply refuses the connection and there are no other obvious side-effects for an adversary to analyse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flow-fingerprinting</strong>. The cover protocol uses the standard library implementation of HTTPS which should be widely used by many different applications in various contexts. Default cipher suites are chosen and other aspects of the implementation are deliberately very typical.</p>
<p>However, this does not cover the <strong>behaviour</strong> of Rosen clients. For example, HTTP requests to an ordinary website are usually a lot smaller than responses. Also, an adversary could compare the traffic between Alice and a Rosen HTTPS server with the static content available on that server to ascertain if something else is going on.</p>
<p>To handle these attacks, the protocol could use some kind of random padding, limit the size and frequency of round trips, or replace the static decoy handler with a custom one that has different traffic characteristics.</p>
<p>Timing patterns are particularly of importance. Currently the client waits a random interval between 0 and 100ms before polling the server for data. This choice was made to minimise latency but it is not typical of an ordinary website. Analysing timing patterns is what <a href="https://kpdyer.com/publications/ccs2015-measurement.pdf">allowed researchers to detect meek</a>, for example. There’s no evidence that this attack is employed by real-world censors, but a configuration flag that implements a tradeoff between performance and behaving “more typically” will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have the capability to test out Rosen, especially if you are behind a firewall that implements censorship, I would greatly appreciate you telling me about about your experiences at my Email address (available on <a href="https://github.com/awnumar">GitHub</a> and on this website’s <a href="https://spacetime.dev/">homepage</a>).

<p>You don’t know a problem exists if nobody has complained to you about it. </p>



<p>You can’t assume that problem X annoys anyone. You can’t even ask them “are you annoyed by X?” because then they might decide they are even if they’ve never thought about it before. And if they’ve never thought about it before, then it’s not a problem worth solving.</p>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52283963-the-mom-test">The Mom Test</a> is about the art of sneakily uncovering people’s problems without letting them tell you what you want to hear. If you go to your mom with an idea, then she’s going to support it no matter how dumb it is. </p>



<p>Here’s how it goes down:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You</em>: “Hey Ma, it’s pretty frustrating to kick your dog’s food bowl and spill it everywhere, right?” </p><p><em>Mom</em>: “Yes honey, that is frustrating!”</p><p><em>You</em>: “Well what would you say if I created a food bowl that automatically covered itself when it got kicked?!”</p><p><em>Mom</em>: “That sounds like a great idea! I’d buy that!”</p></blockquote>



<p>And now you have validated an idea for a product nobody would ever buy, because you led her to the answer you wanted. Good job.</p>



<p>How about this?</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You</em>: “Hey Ma, why is there dog food all over the floor?”</p><p><em>Mom</em>: “Oh I just kicked it accidentally.”</p><p><em>You</em>: “Does that happen a lot?”</p><p><em>Mom</em>: “Nope, that’s the first time. Usually I keep the dog bowl in that corner so it’s out of the way, but I was sweeping this morning.”</p></blockquote>



<p>See the difference? When you don’t lead her to the answer you’re looking for, you get a real answer. This problem isn’t a problem.</p>



<p>I see this a lot with <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/01/pretend-your-internal-initiative-is-a-startup/">internal initiatives</a>. People <em>assume</em> that a problem frustrates their coworkers, because why wouldn’t it? So they end up with agile transformations that address all the wrong issues or internal technology platform teams that build all the wrong tools. </p>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32493686">When Coffee &amp; Kale Compete</a> talks about this in the context of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/24/jobs-to-be-done-is-a-terrible-name/">Jobs To Be Done</a>. It says that you should look for the <em>fire </em>around a problem. If someone gets fired up when they talk about a problem they’re having, that one is worth solving.</p>



<p>Stop solving problems that nobody’s fired up about.</p>

<p>Question from a follower: If I have had COVID-19 already, do I need to get the vaccine and why?</p>



<p>The simple answer is yes.</p>



<p>Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to decrease over time, with some individuals losing measurable antibodies as soon as 6 months post-infection. While there isn’t a lot of data as to whether the lack of circulating immunoglobulins means that the individual is again susceptible to the virus, there have been a few reported cases where individuals have had re-infections which may indicate this as a possibility. There are other questions about whether the lack of circulating antibodies may not be indicative of a loss of infection (see this article by Cox and Brostad (2020), which looks into why the lack of circulating antibodies may only be part of the story) </p>



<p>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-00436-4 </p>



<p>There are a few different theories as to why it is important to be vaccinated, even if you have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2. I want to talk briefly about one of them, and then give a little explanation of why this is important.</p>



<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus (CoV) and shares similar structures to the original SARS, MERS, and other coronaviruses. The main structures of the coronaviruses include five (5) primary structures: Spike Protein (Protein S), Membrane Protein (Protein M), Envelope Protein (Protein E), Nucleocapsid Protein (Protein N), and RNA (see image)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="270" src="https://i2.wp.com/onevaxxednurse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img_3481.jpg?resize=624%2C270&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/onevaxxednurse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img_3481.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i2.wp.com/onevaxxednurse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img_3481.jpg?resize=300%2C130&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image Source: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each of these proteins can be an antigen, and the body is theoretically capable of developing antibodies in response to any or all of the proteins, but in practice, we predominantly develop immune responses to Protein N and Protein S almost exclusively (https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15730). Even with the primary immunological targets being the nucleocapsid and the spike protein, the body’s humoral response (B Cells) heavily focuses on the nucleocapsid protein. There are multiple antigenic sites on each of the proteins, allowing the proteins to be targeted by both cellular (T-Cell et al.) and humoral (B-Cell, Immunoglobulins et al.) action.</p>



<p>https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15730 </p>



<p>One study by Huang et al. (2004) found that over 95% of individuals tested developed N protein-specific antibodies to the original SARS, while less then 50% of individuals developed S protein-specific antigens (https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.20096). With SARS-CoV-2, Burbelo et al. (2020) found slightly different values, such that N protein-specific antigens were present 100% of the time &gt; 14 days post infection, while S protein-specific antigens were present 91% of the time in the same timeframe in their sample of RT-PCR positive individuals (https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa273).</p>



<p>https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.20096</p>



<p>https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa273 </p>



<p>Where this gets interesting is the antigenic drift (small mutations and changes) seen with SARS-CoV-2. When we look at the changes seen in SARS-CoV-2 over the last 12 months, there are few changes to Protein S and moderate changes to Protein N. Of the changes which have been discovered to Protein S, none of these changes have significantly altered the protein, nor have they changed the antigen binding sites (https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15730). Forni et al. (2020) found that the spike protein mutation D614 has increased the infectious capacity but hasn’t changed the antigen sites.</p>



<p>https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15730 </p>



<p>Since the main humoral target for SARS-CoV-2 is the nucleocapsid protein and the nucleocapsid protein has moderate antigenic drift, there is a possibility that mutations to Protein N could allow re-infection without the loss of antibodies. A second factor is that many individuals will have a minor encounter with the virus, which could result in a lower level of immunoglobulins.</p>



<p>By vaccinating against a singular protein (Protein S) which has low antigenic drift, we are able to ensure that the body is able to recognize both the virus and viral-infected cells. Targeting a single protein also allows the body to focus a higher response focused on a smaller number of antigenic sites. Even with the genetic changes that have been seen on the spike protein, they haven’t altered the antigen targets and hence they don’t affect the antigenicity of the virus. This combination of a single protein structure combined with low antigenic changes, should allow a higher immune response (and longer lasting) combined with a longer lasting (less possibility of mutation) immunity.</p>



<p>For more information on Antigenic Drift and Shift, see the Khan Academy video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubp-Dz5uGUk</p>

        </h2>
                    <p>That's right! You can now update WordPress plugins and themes using WP Git Updater.</p>
<p>The primary goal of WP Git Updater is to optimize and automate updates on your Git controlled WordPress websites. We started with plugins but early on it became clear theme updates were a must have. We felt this was such a critical feature we needed to make sure it was available before we officially released WP Git Updater.</p>
<p>Additionally we have been able to retain the same configuration format with some new additions. This is down to some forward thinking knowing theme features were coming in the future.</p>
<p>In short just adding:</p>
<pre><code>themes:
  enabled: true
  path: themes</code></pre>
<p>To your config file is sufficient to enable theme updates.</p>
<p>There are of course further customizations available if required. Full details can be found in the <a href="https://wpgitupdater.dev/docs/latest/configuration">Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Just like plugins you can now automate theme branch and pull request creation on infrastructure and terms you define.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
<p>A while ago I purchased a Nest camera because I liked the idea of only having to provide power and a WiFi connection to get a nice security system.</p>
<p>The fact that you could control it with <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9293712?hl=en">Works with Nest</a> (their open API) was a major factor in that decision.</p>
<p>Then Google bought Nest, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-home/things-to-know-about-works-with-nest-shutdown/">disabled access</a> for users who didn’t sign up in time (including me).</p>
<p>There were some promises that a new open API will be created “soon”.</p>
<p>Eventually, they released the <a href="https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/api">Smart Device Management API</a>, and although you can do some things (get camera stream), you can’t set the “Home/Away” status.</p>
<p>Bummer.</p>

<p>You can read more about it <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9257400">here</a>, but <strong>TL;DR</strong> the Nest camera movement/sound alarms only trigger if it’s set to “Away”.</p>
<p>For reasons I don’t want to go into, the automatic Home/Away feature doesn’t work for me so I need a way to control it from code so it can be automated, as all good things.</p>

<p>Like all pros, my first try was to just open the Nest webapp with DevTools open, click the Home/Away toggle, copy as curl, run it from the CLI and… nothing.</p>
<p>Didn’t work.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection I noticed the payload was binary, never a good sign :)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl --data-binary <span>$'\nB\n\u001aSTRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u0012$XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\u0012\u0095\u0001\n\u000estructure_mode\u0012u\nTtype.nestlabs.com/nest.trait.occupancy.StructureModeTrait.StructureModeChangeRequest\u0012\u001d\u0008\u0002\u0010\u0001\u001a\u0017\n\u0015USER_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u001a\u000c\u0008ü¸Ìþ\u0005\u0010\u0080É\u0087¸\u0001'</span> <span>'https://grpc-web.production.nest.com/nestlabs.gateway.v1.ResourceApi/SendCommand'</span>  
</code></pre></div><p>(some details redacted)</p>

<p>The host endpoint at the end of the <code>curl</code> command was a very good hint that they are using <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, which I didn’t have any experience with so far.</p>
<p>On the gRPC website was our next clue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define your service using Protocol Buffers, a powerful binary serialization toolset and language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That matches the binary payload that we previously saw, now it’s getting exciting!</p>

<p>Since the simple payload replay didn’t do anything, I needed to figure out what’s actually in there.</p>
<p>The first (surprising) problem was actually just getting the binary payload into a text file, I guess the binary was getting messed up somewhere between the browser and the file I was pasting to.</p>
<p>The “Save all as HAR with content” feature was very helpful here, especially since there’s a base64 encoded field beneath the binary one.</p>
<p>Extracting that only took a bit of bash magic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat set-away-home.nest.com.har                           <span>\
</span><span></span>    | gron                                               <span>\
</span><span></span>    | grep <span>'json.log.entries[1].response.content.text'</span>   <span>\
</span><span></span>    | cut -d <span>'"'</span> -f <span>2</span>                                    <span>\
</span><span></span>    | base64 -d                                          <span>\
</span><span></span>    | base64 -d
</code></pre></div><p>(If you don’t know about <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron">gron</a>, you should definitely check it out, it makes JSON grep-able)</p>
<p>(No idea why it was base64-encoded twice)</p>

<p>Going through the official protobuf documentation it seemed like I needed the <code>.proto</code> files to do anything useful.</p>
<p>Which I couldn’t figure out how to extract from the Nest website, or if that’s even possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, I stumbled upon <code>protoc --decode_raw</code>, which gave the following output:</p>
<pre><code>1 {
  1 {
    1: "STRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    2: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
  2 {
    1 {
      1: "STRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      2: "structure_mode"
      3: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    2: 4
    4 {
      1 {
        1: "type.nestlabs.com/nest.trait.occupancy.StructureModeTrait.StructureModeChangeResponse"
        2 {
          1: 1
        }
      }
    }
    6 {
      1 {
        1: "STRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        2: "structure_mode"
        3: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
      }
      2 {
        1: "type.nestlabs.com/nest.trait.occupancy.StructureModeTrait.StructureModeChangeRequest"
        2 {
          1: 2
          2: 1
          3 {
            1: "USER_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
          }
        }
      }
      3 {
        1: XXXXXXXXXX
        2: XXXXXXXXX
      }
    }
  }
}
15: ""
2: ""
15: "\000\000"
</code></pre><p>Quite a heavy payload to set a flag.</p>
<p>Then I tried to manually create the <code>.proto</code> files going by the output from above.</p>
<p>Not fun.</p>
<p>By luck (aka searching GitHub for those types) I found out that somebody a lot smarter than me had actually <a href="https://github.com/derek-miller/nest-protobuf">managed to extract the proto files</a> from the Nest website, thank you stranger!</p>

<p>Time to make use of those <code>.proto</code> files.</p>
<p>Start up the IDE and follow the protobuf tutorial on how to build a payload.</p>
<p>It was a lot harder than I expected.</p>
<p>I’m sure most of the hardness came from me never using protobuf before, but it also took me a bit to realize that they serialize the command we care about (<code>StructureModeChangeRequest</code>) into a generic type (<code>ResourceCommandRequest</code>) which is then also serialized.</p>
<p>Eventually I was able to send the protobuf payload to the Nest API and oh boy, seeing that icon switch from “Home” to “Away” was like an early christmas :)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.emilburzo.com/2020/12/reverse-engineering-nest-home-away-status-api/images/nest-home-away.gif" alt="Nest home to away animation"></p>
<p>Hmm, but why isn’t the HTTP connection closing? It just hangs there.</p>
<p>Comparing the headers from the original request I could see that there’s an <code>X-Accept-Response-Streaming: true</code> header, adding it caused the connection to directly close as expected.</p>
<p>Strange, especially since <code>false</code> keeps the connection open. Mystery for another day.</p>
<p>I packaged everything nicely into a <a href="https://github.com/emilburzo/nest-rest">GitHub repo</a> and moved on to the last part.</p>

<p>The standard approach here would be to install some location tracker on all the “home” phones and periodically send it to a server which then decides when to toggle the Nest status.</p>
<p>Although I actually built an <a href="https://graticule.link/">android location sharing app</a>, I didn’t like this approach due to having to make a tradeoff between battery life and responsiveness.</p>
<p>I also looked into Google Location Sharing, but it involved creating another Google Account, permanently sharing my location with it and using that as the source. Too fragile.</p>
<p>The solution I went with in the end was:</p>
<ul>
<li>assign static IPs to all the relevant phones</li>
<li>try to connect to them from the internal network</li>
</ul>
<p>If the response is <code>connection refused</code>, they are on the network/“home”.</p>
<p>Anything else, they aren’t “home”.</p>
<p>Well, maybe also <code>connection accepted</code> if you’re weird and have a server on your phone.</p>
<p>I’m still surprised how well this works, because I read a lot of “don’t do this” online with reasons like:</p>
<ul>
<li>phones will automatically switch off their WiFi overnight</li>
<li>they won’t respond when they are in deep sleep</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I got lucky, but it works, and it works very well:</p>

<p>I prepared another <a href="https://github.com/emilburzo/nest-home-away">GitHub repo</a>, fired everything up, and… it works!</p>

<p>It really sucks that I had to spend a day for something that either should just work, or at least I should have access to change on my own.</p>
<p>If the camera quality wasn’t so high I would have just ditched it and gone self-hosted with a DVR/NVR.</p>
<p>It would have taken longer to build all the features, but then I have control over every part.</p>
<p>The Nest app is still annoying me to migrate to a Google account, so let’s see for how long this solution actually works.</p>

<p>In 2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation by stacking only (self-)attention layers. Compared to recurrent neural networks, Transformer models exhibit efficient parallel processing of tokens, leading to better modeling of long-range correlations and, most importantly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable scaling in terms of data and compute</a>. Since then, Transformers seem to have taken over natural language processing. Widespread adoption of attention-based architectures seems likely given recent work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale</a> and the flurry of developments addressing the architecture’s quadratic scaling bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Recently, the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> provided complementary post-facto explanations of some of the success of Transformers from the perspective of energy-based models. In this post, I provide a biased overview of (self-)attention in Transformers and summarize its connections to modern Hopfield networks. Along the way, I look for intuition from physics and indulge in hand-wavy arguments on how an energy-based perspective can shed light on training and improving Transformer models.</p>

<p>Let’s start off with an overview of the components in a vanilla Transformer model. Since our focus is on (self-)attention, I am going to assume some prior knowledge<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and skip comprehensive architecture descriptions and experimental results. In <a href="#3-from-hopfield-networks-to-transformers">Section 3</a>, we will start from scratch and use Hopfield networks to build back up to the attention module described below.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-transformers">Vanilla Transformers</h2>
<p>The proto-Transformer was introduced in an encoder-decoder context for machine translation in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a>. The original motivation seems to have been mostly driven by engineering efforts to model long-range correlations in sequence data and the recent successes of attention mechanisms stacked on top of recurrent neural networks. The main contribution and selling point of the paper was making an attention-only approach to sequence modeling work.</p>
<p><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/vanilla_transformer.png" alt="alt text" title="Vanilla Transformers encoder-decoder architecture"></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the encoder on the left and ignore the decoder on the right. Transformer models accept (batches of) sets of vectors, which covers most inputs people care about in machine learning. Text can be modelled as a sequence of embedded tokens. Images can be viewed as a snaky sequence of embedded pixels or embedded patches of pixels. Since sets have no notion of ordering, learned or fixed positional information needs to be explicitly added to the input vectors.</p>
<p>The main module in the Transformer encoder block is the multi-head <em>self-attention</em>, which is based on a (scaled) dot-product attention mechanism acting on a set of $d$-dimensional vectors:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Attention}\left( \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V} \right) = \mathrm{softmax} \left( \frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \mathbf{V}
\label{eq:vanilla-attention}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Here, queries $\mathbf{Q}$, keys $\mathbf{K}$, and values $\mathbf{V}$ are matrices obtained from acting with different linear transformations — parametrized respectively by weights $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{Q}}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{K}}$, and $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{V}}$ — on the same set of $d$-dimensional inputs. <em>Cross-attention</em> takes the inputs for its queries from a different source than for its keys and values, as can be glimpsed from the decoder part of the architecture on the right.</p>
<p>For every input query, the updated output query of \eqref{eq:vanilla-attention} is a linear combination of values weighted by an attention matrix quantifying the overlap of the input query with the keys corresponding to these values. Since all objects are vectors and the attention mechanism is just a dot product between vectors, we can think of the attention module as matching query vectors to their “closest” key vectors in latent space and summing up contributions from value vectors, weighted by the “closeness” of their keys to the queries.</p>
<p>The remaining components of the Transformer encoder block are needed to make the module work properly in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>multi-headedness</em> of the attention module refers to chunking up the dimension of the vector space and having multiple attention operations running in parallel in the same module, yet with each acting on a lower-dimensional segment of the full space. This is a trick to (1) get around the fact that every input vector only couples to one query at a time to calculate its attention coefficient, and (2) provide multiple starting points in the subspaces for the queries, which might help to avoid bad local minima in parameter space during optimization.</li>
<li>A positional feed-forward network, made up of two linear layers with a non-linearity in between, is inserted at the end of the module. Folklore wisdom tells us that the feed-forward layer needs to blow up the dimension of the latent space by a factor of four for it to be able to “disentangle” the represention. More likely though, it’s a way to increase model capacity and warp latent spaces since the attention modules on their own are pretty much linear apart from the $\mathrm{softmax}$-operator used to obtain the normalized attention coefficients.</li>
<li>Residual connections are added to control the flow of gradients.</li>
<li>Layer normalisation is used to control learning dynamics and keep vector norms from exploding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beyond-vanilla-confronting-quadratic-scaling">Beyond vanilla: confronting quadratic scaling</h2>
<p>Most architectural variations of the vanilla Transformer are targeted at the attention module, which scales poorly with respect to the input sequence length $N$. Since the overlap of all queries with all keys is required, calculating a dense attention matrix scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in time and space. Limits on the context window of the attention mechanism during training prevent the model from learning how to deal with long sequences and long-range correlations. The majority of post-vanilla Transformer species can be classified into one of the following buckets<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-rank approximations: truncate the matrix product $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T$ since it’s likely not full rank for structured data</li>
<li>Sparsification: reduce the attention calculation from all query-key pairs to a subset because not all of them feel the need to talk to each other</li>
<li>Recurrence: keep track of a (compressed) history of context</li>
<li>Kernels: approximate the attention operation with kernel methods</li>
</ul>
<p>For the remainder of our discussion, we will focus on vanilla Transformers. One of the goals of this blog post is to explore how a different perspective on the <em>function</em> of attention-based algorithms might lead to qualitatively different improvements beyond what is possible by relying on scaling and reducing computational complexity alone.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide a short history of Hopfield networks and gradually build up intuition until we can recognize the Transformer self-attention mechanism for what it really is. We refer to the <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> for more details and insightful visualizations of pattern storage and retrieval.</p>
<h2 id="classical-discrete-hopfield-networks">Classical discrete Hopfield networks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield network</a> is a simple model for associative memory popularized by John Hopfield in his 1982 paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Networks and Physical Systems with Emergent Collective Computational Abilities</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The task of an associative memory is to store and retrieve patterns, preferably in a way that allows one to recover stored patterns quickly with a low error rate.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the Hopfield network — and other energy-based models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boltzmann machines</a> — is to construct an <em>energy function</em> which defines an <em>energy landscape</em> containing basins of attraction around patterns we want to store. Starting at any pattern, we want to have an update rule pointing towards the closest stored pattern, guided by a scalar “closeness” score provided by the energy function.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/energy_landscape.png" alt="alt text" title="Toy energy landscape of a Hopfield Network"></a></p>
<p>Let’s make this a bit more formal but not too formal. Consider trying to store a set of $N$ binary patterns $\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector whose entries are either $-1$ or $1$. For example, in the case of storing black-and-white images, every image would correspond to a string of pixel values, a binary pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.</p>
<p>For any query $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, or <em>state pattern</em>, we want to find a way to retrieve the closest <em>stored pattern</em>. In his paper, Hopfield considered the energy function</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
E = - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{b} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{ij} \xi_{i} \xi_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{d} b_{i} \xi_{i} ,
\label{eq:ising}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>where $\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denotes a bias vector and the weights $\boldsymbol{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are set to the sum of the outer products of the patterns we want to store</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{x}_{i} \otimes …</p></div></div>

        </p></div><div><p>DRY,
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a>
is frequently touted as a principle of software development.
"Copy-pasta"
is the derisive term applied to a violation of it,
tying together the concept of copying code
and
pasta as description of software development bad practices
(see also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a>).</p>
<p>It is so uniformly reviled that some people call DRY a
"principle"
that you should never violate.
Indeed, some linters even detect copy-paste
so that it can never sneak into the code.
But copy-paste is not a comic-book villain,
and DRY does not come bedecked in primary colors to defeat it.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to know
<em>why</em>
DRY
started out as a principle.
In particular,
some for some modern software development practices,
violating DRY is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The main problem with <em>repeating</em> a code chunk
is that if a bug is found,
there is more than one place where it needs to be fixed.
On the surface of it,
this seems like a reasonable criticism.
All code has bugs,
those bugs will be fixed,
why not minimize the cost of fixing them?</p>
<p>As with all engineering decisions,
following DRY
is a
<em>trade-off</em>.
DRY leads to the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of locality</li>
<li>Overgeneralized code</li>
<li>Coordination issues</li>
<li>Ownership issues</li>
</ul>
<div id="loss-of-locality">
<h2>Loss of locality</h2>
<p>The alternative to copy-pasting the code is usually to put it in a
function (or procedure, or a subroutine, depending on the language),
and call it.
This means that when reading through the original caller,
it is less clear what the code does.</p>
<p>When you are debugging, this means we need to "Step into" the function.
While stepping into, it is non-trivial to check the original variables.
If you are doing "print debugging",
this means finding the original source for the function and adding
relevant print statements there.</p>
<p>Especially when DRY is pointed out and reactions are instinctive,
the function might have some surprising semantics.
For example, mutating contents of local variables is sensible
in code.
When you move this  code to a function as a part of a straightforward
DRY
refactoring,
this means that now a function is mutating its parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="overgeneralized-code">
<h2>Overgeneralized code</h2>
<p>Even if the code initially was the same in both places,
there is no a-priori guarantee that it will stay this way.
For example, one of those places might be called frequently,
and so would like to avoid logging too many details.
The other place is called seldom, and those details are
essential to trouble-shooting frequent problems.</p>
<p>The function that was refactored now has to support an extra parameter:
whether to log those details or not.
(This parameter might be a boolean, a logging level, or even a logging
"object" that has correct levels set up.)</p>
<p>Since usually there is no institutional memory to undo
the DRY refactoring,
the function might add more and more cases,
eventually almost being two functions in one.
If the "copy-pasta" was more extensive,
it might lead to extensive over-generalization:
each place needs a slightly different variation of the functionality.</p>
</div>
<div id="coordination-issues">
<h2>Coordination issues</h2>
<p>Each modification of the
"common"
function now requires testing all of its callers.
In some situations,
this can be subtly non-trivial.</p>
<p>For example,
if the repetition was across different repositories,
now updates means updating library versions.
The person making the change might not even be aware of all the callers.
The callers only find out when a new library version is used in their code.</p>
</div>
<div id="ownership-issues">
<h2>Ownership issues</h2>
<p>When each of those code segments were repeated,
ownership and responsibility were trivial.
Whoever owned the surrounding code also owned
the repeated segment.</p>
<p>Now that the code has been moved elsewhere,
to a
"shared"
location,
ownership can often be muddled.
When a bug is found,
who is supposed to fix it?
What happens if that
"bug"
is already relied on by another use?</p>
<p>Especially in case with reactive DRY refactoring,
there is little effort given to specifying the expected
semantics of the common code.
There might be some tests,
but the behavior that is not captured by tests
might still vary.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Having a common library which different code bases can be relied on is good.
However, adding functions to such a library or libraries should be done
mindfully.
A reviewer comment about
"this code duplicates the functionality already implemented <em>here</em>"
or,
even worse,
something like
<cite>pylint</cite>
code duplication detector,
does not have that context or mindfulness.</p>
<p>It is better to acknowledge the duplication,
perhaps track it via a ticket,
and let the actual
"DRY"
application take place later.
This allows gathering more examples,
thinking carefully about API design,
and make sure that ownership and backwards compatibility issues
have been thought of.</p>
<p>Deduplicating code by putting common lines into functions,
without careful thought about abstractions,
is <em>never</em> a good idea.
Understanding how to abstract correctly is essentially
API design.
API design is subtle, and difficult to do well.
There are no easy short-cuts,
and developing expertise in it takes a long time.</p>
<p>Because API design is such a complex skill,
it is not easy to give general guidelines except one:
wait.
Rushing into an API design does not make a good API,
even if the person rushing <em>is</em> an expert.</p>

<p>I recently bought a webcam from Amazon (late to the party, I know), and when it came it was fine but not amazing.</p>
<p>When I went through the packaging I saw a little card saying "send us a screenshot of your 5-star review and we'll give you a $10 Amazon gift card":</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.kevmod.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_16902.jpg" alt="$10 for 5-star reviews" width="400/"></p>
<p>I thought that other Amazon shoppers would want to know that this was happening and that the reviews were less trustworthy, so I wrote up a review and submitted it to Amazon.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got a notification that my review was rejected.  I heard of Amazon being ham-fisted about this stuff but it was still shocking that it would happen to me:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.kevmod.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot.png" alt="Amazon review rejection"></p>
<p>I assume they rejected this due to the first rule, "Feedback on the seller ... should be provided [elsewhere]".  I could understand this being a good policy in some cases, but here they're using it to justify silencing talk about reviews.  I suppose we don't know whether they disallow positive comments about other reviews, but I would guess that that never happens.</p>
<p>I remember that I used to use Amazon ratings as the main driver behind my purchases, so it's sad to see the review system become less helpful over time.  It's extra sad that Amazon would rather try to hide the issue and not improve it.</p>
<p>Update:<br>
My premise was that the reviews section should be helpful for making purchasing decisions.  Some people (including Amazon) are saying that the reviews should be about the product, which is coherent but I would argue makes them less useful.  For example I feel quite helped when a review for chocolate mentions that the chocolate arrived melted -- this is not a review about the product intrinsically, but is still very helpful for deciding whether or not to buy the item.  Similarly, as a purchaser I would want to see a warning that there may be paid reviews for the product, and I was very surprised to learn that Amazon disallows such warnings.</p>
<p>Update 2:<br>
I submitted feedback through the link they requested, and here's the result:</p>
<p>https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=B087NN41JH&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=1&amp;ref_=olp_merch_name_1&amp;seller=AD5F1I5PAE5XB</p>
<p>I don't think this serves either goal of educating future purchasers or changing the sellers behavior.</p>
<p>Update 3:<br>
I've chatted with an Amazon rep on the issue, and to their credit they seemed to take it seriously and "noted the report violation against the seller".  They said to expect an update in 2-3 business days, though it's not clear what sort of update it will be.</p>

                    <div title="Guide to AR Cards">
                <p>Business cards are pretty much dead. They have been around forever and they don't do much for creating great impression. With many other means of sharing contact details or business information, exchanging these obsolete pieces of papers will at best get the other person snapping a photo of the card and promptly throwing it away.</p><p>In the age of technology, to make these babies work, you gotta step up your game. We need to do something better.</p><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image7.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338"></p><p>That's why we are going to build an augmented reality business card. It's got a wide range of options. It's not just a great marketing tool, but you can surprise your family with AR postcards.</p><p><strong>P.S.: <a href="https://circuitstream.com/workshop/ar-cards-workshop/">This tutorial has a video component as well. Request a video for AR Cards here.</a></strong></p><p>Here's how you build a Merry Christmas AR postcard, for example.</p><p><strong><em>Table of Contents:</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href="#arcard1">How do AR Cards Work?</a></li><li><a href="#arcard2">How to Make Your Own 3D Animated Cards</a></li><li><a href="#arcard3">AR Card Tutorial</a><ul><li><a href="#arc1">Step 1: Design your Business Card</a></li><li><a href="#arc2">Step 2: Unity Project Setup</a></li><li><a href="#arc3">Step 3: Create the AR Reference Library</a></li><li><a href="#arc4">Step 4: Create AR Scene</a></li><li><a href="#arc5">Step 5: Create Tracked Image Prefab</a></li><li><a href="#arc6">Step 6: Make it Pop</a></li><li><a href="#arc7">Step 7: Build and Test your app</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#arcard4">Where to next?</a><a href="#mr10"></a><ul></ul></li></ul><p>AR takes your content to a whole new level, allowing you to add 3D Objects, animations, interactions and what have you, on top of that same old boring physical business card, and all of this moves together with the physical card, as if they were as real as the card itself.</p><p>Best thing, all you need to do is a free version of Unity with a couple of API and a phone's camera (either iOS or android devices are fine). You don't need to a special ar designer — you just need to slap a QR code on it.</p><p>Now you can add even more info about yourself and do that in a striking manner! Sometimes the ideal product presentation is you - and what's the better way to impress your potential customers, than with a memorable tech app.</p><h2 id="arcard1">How Do AR Cards Work?</h2><p>



Using live image tracking technology, available for both Iphone and Android, using their respective techs ARKit and ARCore, the application is able to detect and track your card, allowing you to attach anything you’ve come to expect from mobile apps to the tracked image, be it more info, some dope interactive AR experiences: from animations or even a mini game.</p><p>After creating an app with this tech, it’s just a matter of pointing the phone's camera to your card and watching the magic happen on the screen of a mobile phone.</p><p>This is really just the tip of what ARKit and ARCore can really do, but is already a huge improvement on a dying means of communication.</p><h2 id="arcard2">How To Make Your Own 3D Animated Cards</h2><p>Fortunately for us, creating an AR Business Card is pretty easy, thanks to Unity and one of it’s packages, ARFoundation, that leverages and abstracts the many <a href="https://circuitstream.com/blog/augmented-reality-guide/">ARKit and ARCore features</a>, with simple to use and platform agnostic ar components.</p><p>To create an AR card (or postcard) all you need is a working PC with <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Engine</a>, any asset you might use (3D models, extra images, ...), a physical business card, and some cool ideas! Imagine showing your animated social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn) beside just your contact information.&nbsp;</p><p>No code required..</p><h2 id="arcard3">AR Card Tutorial</h2><h3 id="arc1">Step 1: Design your Business Card</h3><p>A good AR business card should follow the traditional guidelines for readability, layout and creativity, but it must also be a good image target for AR tracking, lucky for us, here are <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/blog-image-recognition-tracking-best-practices-and-target-guidelines/">some guidelines and best practices on that</a>.</p><h3 id="arc2">Step 2: Unity Project Setup</h3><p>Download and install <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html">Unity</a>, make sure to add support for building to your desired platform (Android / Iphone). In this example we are using version 2019.4.16f, targeting Android.</p><p><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStarted.html">Create a new project</a> from the Universal Render Pipeline template.<br><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html">Switch the project target platform</a> to Android or iOS.</p><p>Install the following <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@2.0/manual/index.html">Packages</a>:</p><ul><li>XR Plugin Management</li><li>ARCore / ARKit, version 4+.</li><li>AR Foundation</li></ul><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image1-1-1024x682.png" alt="" width="1024" height="682"></p><p>Configure the XR Plugin Management:</p><ul><li>Access the Project Settings window (menu: Edit &gt; Project Settings).</li><li>Select the XR Plugin Management tab on the left.</li><li>Under the desired platform, check ARCore / ARKit plug-in.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image3-1.png" alt="" width="767" height="448"></p><h3 id="arc3">Step 3: Create the AR Reference Library</h3><p>The AR Reference Library is where you configure which images should be tracked by the ARKit / ARCore libraries.</p><p>From the <em>Project</em> window, create a Folder called <em>“Textures”</em> inside the <em>“Assets”</em> folder, and move your business card image there.</p><p>Under the folder called <em>“Settings”</em>, right click and <em>Create &gt; XR &gt; Reference Image Library</em>.<br>With the <em>Reference Image Library</em> selected, on the Inspector window, hit <em>“Add Image”</em>.</p><ul><li>Click the “Select” button inside the square, and find and select your business card image.</li><li>On the name field add <em>“BusinessCard”</em>.</li><li>Check <em>“Specify Size”</em>, and input the real world dimensions of your card.</li><li>Check <em>“Keep texture at Runtime”</em>.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image4.png" alt="" width="695" height="378"></p><h3 id="arc4">Step 4: Create an AR Scene</h3><p>A <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html">scene in Unity</a> contains the objects of your application, and in our case will be used to add the necessary components that make AR work.</p><p>Under the folder called <em>“Scenes”</em>, right click and <em>Create &gt; Scene</em> and name it <em>ARScene</em>.<br>Double click the <em>ARScene</em>, and let’s start adding the AR components needed.</p><p>Right click the <em>hierarchy</em> window and <em>XR &gt; AR Session</em>.<br>Right click the <em>hierarchy</em> window and <em>XR &gt; AR Session Origin</em>.<br>Delete the main camera.</p><p>Select the “<em>AR Session Origin</em>” object, on the Inspector window click <em>“Add component”</em> and choose <em>“AR Tracked Image Manager”</em>.</p><p>Click the circle with a dot on the field “Serialized Library” of the newly created component, and choose the only entry (that is our previously created Reference Image Library).<br>Set <em>“Max Number of Moving Images”</em> to 1.<br>We will set the <em>“Tracked Image Prefab”</em> in a bit.</p><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image6-1.png" alt="" width="781" height="404"></p><h3 id="arc5">Step 5: Create Tracked Image Prefab</h3><p>Now we need to create what will actually be created when the AR Foundation detects the tracked image. Unity has a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html">prefab feature</a> for this.</p><ul><li>Right click the hierarchy window and hit <em>“Create Empty”</em>.</li><li>Right click the created gameObject, hit <em>“Rename”</em> and change it to <em>“ARBusinessCard”</em>.</li><li>Right click the ARBusinessCard gameObject, and hit <em>“3D Object &gt; Quad”</em>.</li><li>Rename the Quad to <em>“CardReference”</em>, and let’s edit its components from the inspector window.</li><li>Change the X rotation to 90, and the scale to match your business card size. Here 1 means 1 meter, so a default card of 3.5” x 2” would be equal to 8.9 cm x 5.1 cm, and on the inspector 0.089 x, 0.051 y, 1 z.</li></ul><p>Now we create a material so this quad displays the image of your business card, then we can use it as reference to the AR effects we lay on top of it. The <em>“CardReference”</em> is only meant to be a <strong>reference during development</strong>, when you actually build for production, remember to <strong>deactivate it</strong>.</p><p>From the Project window, Inside the Materials folder, Right click and hit <em>“Create &gt; Material”</em> and name it <em>“ReferenceMaterial”</em>.</p><p>With the newly created material selected, on the Inspector window, click the circle with a dot right beside the <em>“Base Map”</em>, and find and select your business card image.</p><p>Select the <em>CardReference</em> gameObject in the <em>Hierarchy</em> window, and on the <em>Inspector</em> window click the circle with a dot on the field <em>“Element 0”</em> under Materials in the <em>Mesh Renderer</em> component, find and select the previously created <em>“ReferenceMaterial”</em>.</p><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image2.png" alt="" width="1005" height="572"></p><p>From the <em>Project</em> window, create a Folder called “<em>Prefabs</em>”, and drag the “<em>ARBusinessCard</em>” gameObject from the Hierarchy window to the newly created “<em>Prefabs</em>” folder, the gameObject should turn blue on the Hierarchy.</p><p>Now we just need to tell the AR components to use this prefab when it detects the tracked images.<br>With the “<em>AR Session Origin</em>” selected on the Hierarchy window, drag the newly created “<em>ARBusinessCard</em>” from the Prefabs folder to the “<em>Tracked Image Prefab</em>” field we left blank earlier.</p><h3 id="arc6">Step 6: Make it Pop</h3><p>With the previous setup you are ready to create your custom AR Card experience, any 3D Model, animation or effect you add to the prefab will appear when your card is visualized through the app.</p><p>The possibilities are endless, here are some Unity features that might help you:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationSection.html">Animations</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/timeline#">Timeline</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/ParticleSystems.html">Particle Effects</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html">Post Processing</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/540/Documentation/Manual/FBXImporter-Model.html">3D Models</a></li></ul><p>The example shown in the initial gif is made entirely of prebuilt Unity features, and requires no code whatsoever. You can get the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W_YtlNEI9Hx7vTMlDSEkTkIF5QnfVVJW/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, or through <a href="https://github.com/circuit-stream/ARBusinessCard">github repository</a>.</p><h3 id="arc7">Step 7: Build and Test your app</h3><p>Finally we need to build our app.</p><p>Setup ARCore build settings following these <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/android-11-build">instructions for android</a>.</p><p>Open the <em>Build Settings</em> windows through “<em>File &gt; Build Settings</em>”.<br>Delete any scene that might be on the Scenes in Build, then click “<em>Add Open Scenes</em>” which should add our <em>ARScene</em> to that list.</p><p><img src="https://cs-wordpress-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/image5-1.png" alt="" width="632" height="607"></p><p>Make sure your mobile is connected to the pc, hit <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/building-for-mobile?uv=5.x"><em>Build and run</em></a>, choose a location to create the build files and wait for it to complete.</p><p>The app should open automatically when the process is complete, then just point it to your business card, and watch the magic happen.</p><h3 id="arcard4">Where to next?</h3><p>AR is a promising technology with many usages yet to be explored.

        <div>
          <p>The lessons and advice that have stuck with me over the years and proved themselves over and over have not come from the board room or on the internet. </p><p>The best business advice I ever received came from little mountain towns in the Rocky Mountains. I've read a lot of advice over the years in different publications. In the tech world now, it's hard to go one day without a new blog post coming across your screen. However, I've never come across any advice that has been better than what I learned inside my own family circle growing up. My great-grandfather and grandfather were both successful businessmen that I learned a lot from. Both successful in their own rights, they instilled a pursuit of entrepreneurship in me and taught me how to work smarter. My work ethic and leadership advice comes from years of working side-by-side with my father in the rural Rockies. </p><p>Why does that matter? A couple of these have been echoed with similar sentiments online as well, but these are bits of advice that I know are over a century old and have worked for many people across at least 5 different industries*. As I was responding to a request for advice the other day, I compiled this list and decided to share it here for those who are interested:</p><h2 id="1-worrying-is-like-paying-interest-on-a-debt-that-you-don-t-have">1. Worrying is like paying interest on a debt that you don't have</h2><p>This is probably one of my favorites that I try to remember. Worrying fixes, literally, nothing. Nothing. If you're worried about something, get busy. You solve a big problem by breaking it into a bunch of little problems. One foot in front of the other and press on. You can bury yourself with worry and anxiety to the point where you get paralyzed. On top of doing nothing to help your situation, it hurts you and usually is not based in reality but rather a set of hypotheticals that may or may not happen. You're paying interest on a debt you don't have yet.</p><h2 id="2-work-on-the-mine-not-in-the-mine">2. Work on the mine, not in the mine</h2><p>It's easy as entrepreneurs, small businesses, startups, and even in a small corporate team to want to handle the day-to-day operations/services yourself. That's working <em>in</em> the business. It can be easy to do for many reasons: saving money, doing it "right", wanting to work side by side with the team, etc. Your main focus, however, should be working <em>on </em>the business. This would include stuff like building new business relationships, optimizing processes, talking with customers to improve your product, business development etc. Find the right people, trust them, and focus on your responsibilities which are to keep the company moving forward.</p><h2 id="3-lead-from-the-front">3. Lead from the front</h2><p>Now this is going to seem to counterintuitive to the previous advice, but it's not. While you should always try to be working on your business and not in your business, it's also important lead from the front. Another way to put this advice, is never ask your team to do anything that you wouldn't do yourself. If you have a technology team largely involved in programming, learn a bit of code and their processes. If you have a bakery, work a full day with your team baking. If you expect your team to work 14 hour days on a deadline, then you damn well better be doing the same. This bit of advice fosters mutual respect in your team, helps you understand their challenges so you can move obstacles out of their way, and fosters a culture of collaboration.</p><h2 id="4-persistence-and-hard-work-is-90-of-success">4. Persistence and hard work is 90% of success</h2><p>The other 10% is a bit of luck and brains. The '4-hour Workweek' was a book that spawned a bunch of praise and people looking for an easy fix. The book has good processes and solutions for efficiency, but I've yet to meet a real world entrepreneur that doesn't have to work very hard day in and day out for a number of years before realizing a business that can operate with such little input. If success was easy, we would have an entire world filled with millionaires. As well as hard work, persistence is a common denominator of great people doing great things. Something I heard a while back from Jason Roks could be paraphrased by, "A hacker isn't only a genius writing code. A hacker is defined by persistence -- never giving up until you find your way through or around an obstacle."</p><h2 id="5-the-best-investments-free-your-time-up-for-other-investments-projects">5. The best investments free your time up for other investments/projects</h2><p>I am not quite sure how to best summarize this advice, but the basic principles are working smarter and investing in processes and efficiencies. This goes hand and hand with the advice "Work on the mine, not in the mine." Your time is your most valuable asset that you have to invest - even &nbsp;more so than the capital that is being reinvested into the company. There are only so many hours in the day. Nearly every investment that you make with your time should be doing 1 of 2 things. #1, directly impacting revenue or #2, improving a process*. If you're doing #2 then it should be a process that allows more of #1. 20% of your effort gets, 80% of the results. In your own business, find what that 20% is that works and maximize it.</p><hr><ol><li>Probably more. Just 5 that I know of. </li><li>What about stuff like education and employee development? Happy employees impact revenue. You need processes and policies informing employees of their benefits as such. This rule isn't meant to be ruthless. It's meant to drive the question for everything you invest your time in, "How is this impacting revenue and business health?" The truth is many activities, if you asked that question, would not pass the test.</li></ol><hr><h3 id="listen-to-cody-talk-about-the-problems-with-corporate-innovation-on-the-startup-or-start-over-podcast"><a href="https://www.startuporstartover.com/2020/10/corporate-innovation-cody-littlewood/">Listen to Cody talk about the problems with corporate innovation on the Startup or Start Over podcast</a></h3>

<p>Customer satisfaction often gets left behind in a fast-growing company’s list of priorities. But, the sooner you start tracking customer satisfaction metrics, the sooner you can diagnose potential problems in your business and solve them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to walk you through all of the key customer satisfaction metrics you should be tracking.</p>



<p>We’ll look at:</p>



<ul><li>How Do You Measure Customer Satisfaction?</li><li>Why Do Your Customer Satisfaction Metrics Matter So Much?</li><li>6 Key Customer Satisfaction Metrics You Should Be Measuring</li><li>How to Collect Customer Satisfaction Data</li></ul>



<p>By the end, you’ll have actionable steps to implement in your business, allowing you to easily set up a system to collect feedback, and track your customer satisfaction metrics.</p>



<p>Sounds good?</p>



<p>Let’s dive in.</p>



<h2>How Do You Measure Customer Satisfaction?</h2>



<p>There are a variety of metrics that you can use to measure customer satisfaction, including Net Promoter Score, Customer Satisfaction Score, Customer Health Score, and more.</p>



<p>Most companies don’t need to measure every single metric (but it won’t hurt). Pick a few to focus on, figure out how to improve them, and move on to a new area to improve.</p>



<p>By looking at multiple metrics together, you can get a better understanding of how happy your customers are, and understand how different parts of your customer experience affect satisfaction.</p>



<p>As well as looking at quantitative data, run surveys and customer interviews to find insights that would be impossible to learn from quantitative methods.</p>



<h2>Why Do Your Customer Satisfaction Metrics Matter So Much?</h2>



<p>Just because someone is paying you, doesn’t mean they’re happy with the service you provide.</p>



<p>By keeping your ear to the ground, you’ll have a feedback loop between your customers and your team.</p>



<p>You can use your feedback to:</p>



<ul><li>Identify pain points in your product or service</li><li>Implement user onboarding email or live chat sequences to improve the service experience</li><li>Find out what your users truly care about and use that in your marketing</li></ul>



<p>It’s not just a feel-good measure, either.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/future-of-cx">96% of people</a> say that <a href="https://www.customerly.io/blog/marketing/2019/10/18/how-to-use-great-customer-service-for-your-marketing-strategy">customer service</a> is important in their choice of brand.</p>



<p>Once you start measuring your customer satisfaction levels, you can make decisions to improve them and ensure your customers stick around, which is key to sustainable business growth.</p>



<p>In the next section, let’s take a look at some of the most important customer service metrics to track.</p>



<h2>6 Key Customer Satisfaction Metrics You Should Be Measuring</h2>



<p>Every business will have slightly different definitions of customer success, so some of these metrics will be more relevant than others.</p>



<p>The key is to adapt them to your business and use them appropriately.</p>



<h3>1. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)</h3>



<p>First, we have Customer Satisfaction score, or CSAT for short. It’s a general measure of customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>The most simple way to calculate CSAT is to ask your customers: “<em>How satisfied are you with [product / service name]?”.</em></p>



<p>Then, they respond on a one to five scale:</p>



<ol><li>Very unsatisfied</li><li>Unsatisfied</li><li>Neutral</li><li>Satisfied</li><li>Very satisfied</li></ol>



<p>Once the results are in (aim to collect as many responses as possible), you can calculate CSAT with this formula:</p>



<p><strong><em>(Positive Responses / Total Responses) * 100 = CSAT</em></strong></p>



<p>Depending on the service you provide, a good CSAT will vary, but aim for at least 80%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can easily run CSAT surveys via a live chat widget, or the occasional email survey.</p>



<p>Anything less than that and there’s likely to be undiagnosed problems in your product/service delivery.</p>



<h3>2. Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.customerly.io/blog/marketing/2019/02/14/saas-measuring-nps">Net Promoter Score</a>, or NPS, is a popular customer satisfaction metric to measure.</p>



<p>You’ll ask your customers: “<em>How likely are you to recommend [company] to a [friend/ colleague]?</em>”</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6caTPn0i2qrQ878x_3sjCqJNYdYjHCHk_B2puphjXwHy5HUKBD-pQGzOsC38gPgHU7ov4cS_F-lAVb7l9zPhgPya3_7UYGE_-SyUW48vYZfKlB0IdlGUUjd2N25AL9YsoQSK1PdX" alt="Essential Customer Satisfaction Metrics to Track NPS"></figure>



<p>You then categorize answers into three buckets based on the score they gave.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Promotors</strong>: gave a score of 9-10&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Passives</strong>: gave a score of 7-8</li><li><strong>Detractors</strong>: gave a score of 0-6</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/are-you-experienced-infographic/">Research by Bain</a> found that a customer experience promoter has a lifetime value of 600-1,400% more than a detractor.</p>



<p>To calculate your NPS, use the following formula:</p>



<p><strong><em>% Promoters – % Detractors = NPS</em></strong></p>



<p>It’s a great metric to track because it’s holistic. Your customers wouldn’t recommend your product to their friends or coworkers if the support was terrible (even if your product is useful).</p>



<p>If your NPS is low, you can start by breaking up the customer experience into different parts, and work on improving them individually.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you have an average NPS of 60. You redesign your <a href="https://www.customerly.io/blog/saas/2019/10/17/saas-onboarding-emails-increase-engagement-plus-6-sizzling-saas-email-templates">onboarding process</a>, changing nothing else in your product. Users signing up after the redesign now give an average NPS score of 75. You now know that your onboarding was a key pain point in the customer journey.</p>



<p>You can work on improving different parts of the customer experience, and track how each one affects NPS.</p>



<p>You can easily measure NPS using Customerly. Simply head to the NPS tab in your dashboard, then set your parameters.</p>



<p>Once it’s running, you’ll see data on your NPS score, vote distribution, and more.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/25tuMUCQwYDO3pjXLjg8QkN3i0q-LkA8sk7B7__m5sEeza6E1ynEtVWJ8uSrWJCCFsML2s20hmcs6kEAroKFTXu2L6B3wuVak9Nf8iqW1bWsBa2hqKG7P5ZBQ3IxTucDsUJn8Jsr" alt="Essential Customer Satisfaction Metrics to Track Net Promoter Score"></figure>



<p>As well as seeing quantitative data, you’ll see what your customers are saying about your company.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/d5C99E9uXk3EkuiNzmyxlOKPbUDpfkVQ4N1yPCLEAEKXcDCo4vC2Y_rmRoPlCRrb2r_Ng5WMau_J9egMToRFxW0jKGsAuXdNi_jbmJ31xP3XU0s353OmswUoDLuVBV7d75Wyo4oX" alt="Essential Customer Satisfaction Metrics to Track NPS Analysis"></figure>



<p>With the combination of quantitative and qualitative feedback, you’ll get a full picture of how your customers are feeling.</p>



<p>Looking at your NPS will force you to confront that not everyone would recommend your product to others, and you can then figure out how to take the customer experience to the next level.</p>



<p>These are <a href="https://www.customerly.io/blog/marketing/2019/02/14/saas-measuring-nps">7 Reasons why every SaaS needs to start measuring NPS</a>.</p>



<h3>3. Customer Effort Score (CES)</h3>



<p>Customer Effort Score (CES) is a good indicator of how easy it is for your customers to have their problems solved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a good metric to understand how effective your customer support is.</p>



<p>To measure your Customer Effort Score, ask your customers to score the ease of ticket resolution on a 1-10 scale. Then, use this formula:</p>



<p><strong><em>Total CES Sum / Number of Responses = Customer Effort Score</em></strong></p>



<p>But, why measure CES? A couple of reasons.</p>



<p>CES is <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/unveiling-the-new-and-improved-customer-effort-score/">40% more accurate</a> at predicting customer loyalty than CSAT.</p>



<p>It’s also a good way to identify areas to improve in your customer service systems, for example, by adding a self-service knowledge base or chatbot.</p>



<p>Customers will spend less time looking for information they need, and your team will spend less time on support calls or writing replies.</p>



<p>As always, it’s key to remember that the metric doesn’t exist in a vacuum. A CES will show a customer’s feeling at one point in time. For example, you might consistently score well on your CES, but if a single customer then says it took a look of effort to resolve a problem, it will reflect poorly on your customer support team.</p>



<p>To improve your CES, focus on improvements such as:</p>



<ul><li>Reducing response time (even if the problem isn’t resolved immediately)</li><li>Creating a self-service knowledge base</li></ul>



<p>You can easily create an effective knowledge base using <a href="https://customerly.io/">Customerly</a> that users can search through to quickly solve problems.</p>



<p>First, head to the <em>Help Center</em> on your dashboard.</p>







<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k0_xxGTG3dE74wg59p6dRxi5p2EZ_mTbIs45aHb7pAwEsQXsNqPSIeDX8vMxPTfqlj_Pos-KB03V6DdAw1HFe6_7wXaTfUKJQOqknqOb63H8gvwr1hD6YIh2mroT4M-3hyQYm9F5" alt="Essential Customer Satisfaction Metrics to Track Help Center"></figure>



<p>Create your help center, and create docs around common pain points your leads and customers have.</p>



<p>Once your help docs are live, your users will be able to search through them directly from your live chat widget.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VDMBfoXGjlg5YFcgFotMEIhmHb9lawpA5tPbQpHVsQtkLzf4_W39s-nt2yjcrDftJqYIdcKDuof6Lv1jSNAcVagaXtgLXE3Hcs40i8IEjlwHRQ6Wa-uOPSD0aUZSvwWUdl4FvIOR" alt="Essential Customer Satisfaction Metrics to Track Help Center Live Chat"></figure>



<p>They’ll get instant answers, making the problem-resolution process effortless.</p>



<p>If there’s no answer to their question, they can easily start a new conversation with your support team.</p>



<p>It’s a simple and effective way to help people solve their problems without routing every new question to your already-busy team.</p>



<p>At the end of every help doc, you can also ask your customers how helpful it was by letting them react to it in a click.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d_BQBWO5038Toh8SMl_6_otEiva8szur12jnqpTopBUcKXKMOX4iYrqHKDXG1A6f3QLxTNo-TXxOHffnzqfGcMkzzH5AArS5t22VdRvw8hiUI3XQ8iRA7YCAN33OuG6swHNR8BKn" alt="Essential Customer Satisfaction Metrics to Track Help Center Feedback"></figure>



<p>If people aren’t satisfied with the answer you provided, you know that there’s an opportunity to update your answers to help your customers.</p>



<h3>4. Customer Health Score (CHS)</h3>



<p>Customer Health Score (CHS) is a metric unique to your company and product. It’s a score you give customers based on if they’re taking actions you consider important.</p>



<p>For example, if you run an email marketing platform, you’ll consider outcomes like:</p>



<ul><li>If they’ve integrated their account with their email provider</li><li>Number of subscribers a user imports to their email list</li><li>First email campaign sent</li></ul>



<p>These are metrics that are tied to success and <a href="https://www.customerly.io/blog/marketing/2019/10/31/6-unique-customer-retention-strategies">customer retention</a> with your product.</p>



<p>At Customerly, our CHS is linked to actions like:</p>



<ul><li>Help Desk being setup</li><li>Customer feedback surveys implemented</li><li>Number of contacts imported</li><li>Whether someone launches an NPS or not</li></ul>



<p>One way to calculate CHS for key actions is:</p>



<p><strong><em>(Number of new users doing [valuable action] within 30 days / Total new users in last 30) days * 100</em></strong></p>



<p>Your CHS will need to be updated whenever you ship new product updates, or your onboarding process changes. The key is that it’s linked to someone being successful with your product.</p>



<p>An easy way to improve your CHS is to use an in-app live chat triggered at key moments, or to run regular customer interviews with new users to find areas to improve in your onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>5. Customer Churn Rate</h3>



<p>Surveys, feedback, and customer interviews are nice, but the real test of how happy your customers are is your churn rate.</p>



<p>To calculate your customer churn rate, you can use the following simple formula:</p>



<p><strong><em>Total Number of Churned Customers / Total Number of Customers = Churn Rate</em></strong></p>



<p>There are other ways to calculate churn depending on your business model and growth rate. But, however you choose to measure it, it’s a critical metric to keep track of. If your churn is high, it’ll be hard to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The typical churn rate for SaaS companies is in the range of 2-8%, according to <a href="https://www.profitwell.com/customer-churn/calculate-churn-rate">data from ProfitWell</a>. If your churn is higher than that, you’ll have trouble growing.</p>



<h3>6. Don’t Forget Qualitative Questions</h3>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Process_Methodology"> <b>Object Process Methodology (OPM)</b></a><b> </b>is a conceptual modeling language and methodology for capturing knowledge and designing systems. Based on a minimal universal ontology of stateful objects and processes that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains. OPM was conceived and developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Dori">Dov Dori</a>. The ontology of OPM and ontology of <b><a href="https://samim.io/p/2020-01-08-introduction-to-knowledge-representation-and-navya-nyay/">Navya-Nyāya</a></b> an ancient Hindu school of thought in india are identical.</p>

</div><p><b>Following text from the blog post "<a href="https://www.gollner.ca/2008/03/object-process.html">Object Process Methodology</a>" - by Joe Gollner:</b></p><p>My encounter with OPM was facilitated by attending the above-referenced course at MIT. This course was delivered by Professor Dov Dori, the driving force behind OPM, and by Professor Edward Crawley, Head of the Cambridge MIT Institute and advocate for how OPM can be leveraged to model business as well as system considerations. The course, I should note, represents the best value I have ever encountered in a professional education program. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the general question of modeling complex systems in a way that all stakeholders can intuitively understand.</p><p>I will attempt an unforgivably brief description of OPM here. The Object Process Methodology offers an astoundingly simple framework for modeling systems and scenarios of unlimited complexity. The root of its ability to do so lies in the fact that it departs from the prevailing fixation with Object Orientation (OO) which, in ultimately trying to represent the world using constructs relevant to software, inevitably spawns bewildering models as soon as it moves beyond anything more "real" than a software component. The main departure that OPM makes, as its name suggests, is the elevation of "processes" to being peers to "objects". In the real world, there are things and there are things that happen to things and this basic decomposition of conceptual units fits reality to a tee. So it is that whereas the full envelope of UML diagrams provides over 150 individual symbols, OPM manages to get by with literally a handful. This simplicity then makes a second major departure possible - the elimination of the litany of diagram types. In OPM, there is only one diagram type and only one integrated view. This is one major reason why business people can immediately grasp the contents of an OPM model.</p><p>Equally interesting is the fact that associated with any visual representation that can be constructed using the OPM notation will be a supporting "natural language" expression. The above image illustrates a very simple OPM model. The image is taken from the OPCAT modeling tool and along the bottom of the screen shot can be seen both the limited set of symbols used and a segment of the natural language expression associated with the model. [...]<br></p><p>The short summary of this argument is that anyone interested in the general problem of understanding complex systems, and representing and communicating that understanding to a broad community of stakeholders, absolutely must take a closer look at the Object Process Methodology.</p><p><b>Short video interview with Dov Dori.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Major feature changes have successfully pushed Lambda workloads into the mainstream, even if FaaS purists feel betrayed</em></p><p>Is serverless winning?</p><p>If you ask AWS, they’ll say <em>definitely</em>. Nearly half of all new applications built inside Amazon this year are <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/30/exclusive-aws-chief-andy-jassy-wakeup-call-cloud-adoption/">running on Lambda</a>. Andy Jassy took time in his re:Invent keynote to call out the thousands of enterprises who now run Lambda workloads in production, but perhaps most interesting was that this year the new serverless feature announcements graduated to Jassy’s keynote — a spot usually reserved for the flashiest, most strategic reveals of the year. AWS, at least, clearly believes that serverless is now one of the primary selling points for its cloud.</p><p>(On the other hand, there’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/adoption-of-aws-lambda-serverless-stalls/">this odd article</a>, which spends most of its length demonstrating FaaS growth, but ran under the headline “Serverless Adoption Stalls” because … Kubernetes teams say they aren’t using as much Lambda? In other news, cats report eating fewer vegetables.)</p><p>What’s not in debate is that Lambda, still the 900-pound gorilla of FaaS, looks a lot different today than when it went GA in 2015. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/">loud, weird niche of engineers</a> who bought into serverless early have always had <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1336765475615879181">very specific ideas</a> about what good serverless systems look like … and lately, Lambda’s been rattling their assumptions.</p><h2 id="h-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-serverless-manifesto">The Decline and Fall of The Serverless Manifesto</h2><p>Those original ideals of FaaS purity didn’t just materialize out of thin air. As recently as 2016, AWS serverless leadership was talking up something they called the Serverless Compute Manifesto. This was a radical vision for how Functions-as-a-Service should, uh, function. The manifesto showed up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOgc3MRUrs">all sorts of talks</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Serverlessconf/status/735839492431548418">at ACG’s ServerlessConf</a>. Here are its key tenets:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2016)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</em></li><li><em>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</em></li><li><em>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</em></li><li><em>Scales per request; Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</em></li><li><em>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</em></li><li><em>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</em></li></ul><p>This manifesto formed a shocking and highly countercultural blueprint for how to build and deploy software. It attracted a small but vibrant community of true believers and a somewhat larger and much louder set of skeptics.&nbsp;</p><p>But in retrospect, the serverless compute manifesto had trouble penetrating beyond that small, engaged nucleus. The bold vision just left out too many existing, legacy workloads and teams.</p><p>So, gradually, like the commandments in Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm, </em>AWS’s non-negotiables of serverless compute began to change. Let’s run through each point of the manifesto and see if Lambda still adheres to it.</p><p><strong>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling?</strong></p><p><em>Sorta, but not strictly. </em>You can deploy multi-function Lambda Layers to manage large binaries, or (now in preview) Lambda Extensions to plug in third-party agents that I’ve been told should definitely not be thought of as “sidecars for Lambda”.</p><p><strong>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>As of re:Invent 2020, Lambda <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">now allows you to bring your own containers</a> instead of just shipping a ZIP file of code.</p><p><strong>Permanent storage lives elsewhere?</strong></p><p><em>Not necessarily. </em>Lambda now integrates with EFS, which I guess is technically “elsewhere”, but no more so than any other NFS share attached to a server is “elsewhere”. It’s a persistent filesystem mounted to your compute.</p><p><strong>Scales per request?</strong></p><p><em>Yes!</em> Now that Lambda can run containers, I believe the request model is now the biggest remaining conceptual difference between Lambda and a managed container service like AWS Fargate. Lambda gives you a new execution environment per concurrent request, whereas a Fargate-like service will still process multiple concurrent requests on the same (long-lived) container.</p><p><strong>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>Meet Provisioned Capacity, which trades your cold start problem for a hot cost problem. (I snark, but Provisioned Capacity is way better than running your own Lambda pre-warming job, which a LOT of people used to do.)</p><p><strong>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true – </em>not if you use Provisioned Capacity or EFS, anyway.</p><p><strong>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere?</strong></p><p><em>Ehhhh. </em>This one is about abstracting away availability zones, which a lot of higher-level AWS services besides Lambda (including Fargate!) now do. That said, we’re starting to hear more guidance from AWS that really, the fault domain you need to be thinking about is regions. That’s right: regions are the new availability zones, and savvy Lambda developers are rolling their own (very un-managed) multi-region architectures as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>To reinforce the trend, let’s check in with two other defining early features of Lambda:</p><p><strong>Intentional time and space constraints?</strong></p><p><em>Less and less true</em>. Function disk sizes, runtime limits, and CPU and memory sizes have steadily increased over the last 5 years. Today you can run a Lambda function for 15 minutes with 10 GB of memory and 6 vCPUs – a hefty enough blob of compute to make you think seriously about multi-threading, multi-purpose functions, and other things that are against the old ideals of FaaS.</p><p><strong>Zero-trust networking?</strong></p><p><em>Only if you want it. </em>In the old days, Lambda architectures biased heavily toward IAM security rather than using VPCs, partly for ideological reasons but also because attaching functions to custom ENIs added tremendous cold start overhead. Today, innovation from AWS has made customer-managed VPCs much more compatible with Lambda.</p><p>So what we have now is an updated manifesto that looks like this:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2020)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><s>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</s></em></li><li><em><s>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</s></em></li><li><em><s>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</s></em></li><li><em>Scales per request; </em><em><s>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</s></em></li><li><em><s>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</s></em></li><li><em><s>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</s></em></li><li><em><s>Intentional time and space constraints</s></em></li><li><em><s>Zero-trust networking</s></em></li></ul><p>I feel like Willy Wonka at the end of the chocolate factory tour, looking around to see where all the children went. Of all those ideological principles, those lines in the sand, <em>per-request scaling is the only thing left.&nbsp;</em></p><p>You can still build according to the original serverless manifesto, of course. But the service doesn’t <em>require </em>you to.</p><p>If you had to distill the revised value prop of Lambda down into a single maxim, <em>Animal Farm-</em>style, what would you even say at this point? “<em>All workloads are managed, but some are more managed than others?</em>“</p><h2 id="h-the-rise-of-serverless-for-everyone">The rise of serverless for everyone</h2><p>This seems like the right time to clarify that I mostly like the additions to Lambda. I think they are necessary and in many cases, an unmixed good.</p><p>I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. I was much more of a FaaS purist at that time. What changed my mind was years of hearing a very particular type of statement from engineering teams, repeated over and over in different variations:</p><p><strong><em>I would love to use Lambda, if only it …</em></strong><em> </em>[connected back to my on-prem VPC, was big enough to run my workload, let me use the same language or developer tooling as my other systems, was always warm, supported some form of shared storage, etc, etc]</p><p>My first reaction to these statements was: Why would you want to use Lambda if you can’t or won’t embrace stateless, containerless, scale-to-zero functions? That’s the whole <em>point </em>of Lambda. It sounded to me like those Kubernetes cats from the New Stack survey, saying they’d really like to eat vegetables if they only contained more meat.</p><p>But I’ve since come to understand that the really powerful part of that statement is the beginning part. It’s a statement of longing.</p><p><em>I’d love to use Lambda, if only …</em></p><p>What is it about Lambda, and serverless compute in general, that inspires this reaction in so many people? Why does a brand-new baby computing paradigm spark such compulsive interest everywhere from tiny startups to big ol’ legacy enterprises?</p><p>Because more than any specific technical detail, serverless computing is an idea. An idea expressed in a simple phrase: <em>Own less, build more. </em>All the serverless doctrine, all the technical guidance boils down to this goal. Lambda is an aspirational lifestyle.</p><p>Lambda, circa 2016, was massively ahead of its time, and to some extent still is. But because of the new feature additions, up to and including container support, it’s making the <em>own less, build more </em>identity more accessible to more builders than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>What AWS is doing is, one by one, taking away the <em>if only</em>s<em>. </em>They’re removing reflexive objections to serverless by providing reassuring options — shared storage, provisioned capacity — for teams that need them. <em>I’d love to use Lambda!</em></p><h2 id="h-guiding-the-future">Guiding the future</h2><p>Will some teams use these features out of confusion or inertia, not realizing that they could build something more radical, more manifesto-like?

It’s got more tacked-on feature creep and incoherent UX paths than a 2001 VCR. And say what you will about infrastructure-as-code, the console is still how people explore new services.

Unfortunately, when it comes to competing for talent, private companies have always been at a disadvantage to public companies. Let’s imagine a scenario where an employee has two competing offers where the cash offer is the same.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Private Company:</strong> $100K worth of stock, 100% YoY Growth</li><li><strong>Public Company:</strong> $100K worth of stock, 35%YoY Growth</li></ul><p>On paper, the private company offer looks better. The company is doubling every year so the stock will grow much faster. In practice, however, people discount the stock because it’s illiquid. That puts the private company at a significant disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><p>We think there’s a better way. <a href="http://www.angellist.com/recurring-transfers">Recurring Transfers</a> enables private companies to offer recurring liquidity as a way to attract and retain great talent. We built the product to provide maximum control on who gets to sell how much and when. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Control the process while reducing overhead:</strong> set parameters for incoming LPs, percentages individuals can sell, and more, while AngelList manages the entire process end-to-end on a recurring basis</li><li><strong>Streamline the cap table, future voting, and signatures:</strong> the buying entity will vote with the majority of non-conflicted holders of the same class and only a single signature is needed from AngelList for all buyers</li><li><strong>Protect private information:</strong> information rights are held by the single block and not provided to the underlying investors</li><li><strong>Offer recurring liquidity</strong> as a benefit to employees to differentiate compensation offerings from competitors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.pipe.com/">Pipe.com</a> uses Recurring Transfers to make sure their employees can get liquidity on a recurring annual basis - something private companies historically haven't actively promoted. </p><p><strong>Harry Hurst, co-founder and co-CEO said, </strong></p><blockquote>“At Pipe, we believe that our entire team should have the same access to liquidity usually only afforded to founders. Everyone at the company may go through life-changing events such as buying a house or starting a family, we want to make sure that our team can get access to liquidity along the way to provide the financial cushion they need and deserve. AngelList's reputation for being startup-friendly gave us the confidence to choose them as our trusted partner.” </blockquote><p>Furthermore, companies can attract investors and talent by offering liquidity as part of a compensation package, reducing pressure for early investors and employees. </p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://angellist.com/blog/introducing-transfers-the-company-friendly-liquidity-solution?_ga=2.224275995.1222680455.1608045226-1365692428.1604910835">we introduced Transfers</a>, which enabled companies to take control of their liquidity options, while reducing operations, time, and expenses. With Recurring Transfers, we've further streamlined the process allowing for end-to-end liquidity management on a recurring basis. This added flexibility permits companies to offer shareholders liquidity on a recurring basis without having to incur extra overhead.</p><p><a href="http://www.angellist.com/recurring-transfers">Recurring Transfers</a> allows companies to manage their liquidity without having to manage the process periodically.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article we are going to explore <b>lateral joins. </b></p><p><b>"What is a lateral join?"</b> you may ask. It's a new kind of <i>join</i> that allows to extract and work with the single elements found inside an array, as if the array was a normal table.</p><p>Lenses 4.1 comes with a lot of new features that make your life easier when working with arrays: we introduced <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/functions/#array-functions">6 new functions to work with arrays</a>, better support for array literals, and lateral joins.</p><p>All these features are available both for our Snapshot and Streaming Engine.</p><p>You can read more about <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/streaming/laterals/">this functionality in our docs</a>, as well as trying it yourself following <a href="https://help.lenses.io/sql/streaming/explode-arrays/">this self-contained tutorial</a>.</p><p>What we would like to focus on in this post, however, is how this feature came to be; designing this functionality has been an exciting journey and we thought it would be useful to share the thought process and iterations behind the implementation.</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->We will initially explore the high-level requirements that motivated this feature;</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Then we will explore what a possible solution could look like and the implications of each approach</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Finally we will go through our design iterations, concluding with the final result and how it delivers all that we set out to achieve.</p></li></ul><p>Let's get cracking.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>Assume that you have a topic called <code>batched_readings</code> that collects readings from some kind of sensor meter.</p><p>The upstream system stores "batches" of reading per meter. That means that each single record will contain multiple readings for its meter:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[81,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;81]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[95,&nbsp;94,&nbsp;93,&nbsp;96]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[80,&nbsp;82]&nbsp;}</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Our goal is to extract the single readings for each record, and build a new topic where each record contains only one reading:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;100&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;101&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;102&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;81&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;82&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>...</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
How can we do that?</p><h2>Exploring the solution space</h2><p>Before starting to work on the feature, we did some research to see if and how this functionality was implemented in other SQL streaming systems or more traditional RDBMS systems.</p><p>We found two main different approaches to the problem:</p><h3>The "Explode" approach</h3><p>
Some systems implement the functionality introducing special functions that can be used as a normal projections, right after the <code>SELECT&nbsp;</code>clause. The idea is that a special function will "explode" the array, making the select emit a record for each item in the array.</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading</pre><p>The syntax is quite straightforward and easy to use in this simple case, but we found it a bit more complex and less predictable in more complicated scenarios, like when multiple <code>EXPLODE</code>s are used or when multi-level arrays need to be worked with.</p><p>Another limitation of this approach is that it is hard to work with the exploded array elements outside the projection. For example, something like this is not possible in KSqlDB:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;100</pre><p>

In general, we soon realized that treating <code>EXPLODE</code> as a normal function (albeit one that generates more than one output per each input) was not the right choice for us. We could do better.</p><h3>The "Table Function" approach</h3><p>Not satisfied with the solution above, we considered whether moving the <code>EXPLODE</code> to the source would solve the some of the highlighted problems.</p><p>After some research, we realized that this was an approach already embraced by other classical RDBMS systems like PostgreSQL, with its <code>unnest</code> table function.</p><p>This approach is based on two concepts:</p><ol><li><p> <b>Table functions: </b>functions that transforms normal values to tables</p></li><li><p> <b>Lateral joins: </b>with lateral joins it is possible to express a relation between the value of a field on the left-hand side of a join, and its right-hand side. This contrasts with traditional joins, where you can only join tables that are completely independent of one another.</p></li></ol><p>With these concepts to hand, our first design iteration defined a new <code>EXPLODE</code> table function and a new <code>LATERAL</code> keyword, to be able to join a source to the result of a table function:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</pre><p>The table function <code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code> should be read as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>Take the current value of the </i><i><code>readings</code></i><i> array and transform it to a table. Such table will have only one column, called </i><i><code>reading</code></i><i>, and each element of the original array will be a row in that table.</i></p></blockquote><p><code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code> is a table that depends on the value of the <code>readings</code> field for each single record. Every record will then produce a table.</p><p>Going back to our meter reading example, consider the first record, where <code>readings</code> is <code>[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]</code>. For that record, the expression <code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)&nbsp;</code>will produce the following table:</p><pre>|&nbsp;reading&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>-----------</pre><pre></pre><pre>|&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|&nbsp;101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|&nbsp;102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Since we gave the name <code>reading</code> to the elements inside <code>readings</code>, we can use it in the <code>SELECT</code> as if it were a normal field.</p><p>But not only that, we can use it wherever we want, like in a <code>WHERE</code> or in a <code>GROUP&nbsp;BY</code> !</p><p>The table expression <code>batched_reading&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code> can at this point be read as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>For each record in </i><i><code>batched_reading</code></i><i>, compute the table </i><i><code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code></i><i>, and join that table with the original record.</i></p></blockquote><p>That means that if we take again the record <code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;}</code> as an example, the above table expression will result in the following table:</p><pre>|&nbsp;meter_id&nbsp;|&nbsp;readings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;reading&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|----------|----------------|---------|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;|100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;|101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;|102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre>
<h3>Our final approach</h3><p>After exploring the table function approach, we realized that the only real concrete example of a table function would be <code>EXPLODE</code>; we then understood that we could use directly the array expression as the argument of the <code>LATERAL</code> join, without the <code>EXPLODE</code> function.</p><p>With that simplification the query becomes:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><p>This brings a small but effective improvement to the syntax, as well as making an important aspect of our approach to lateral joins more prominent: we can treat <i>any</i> array as a valid right-hand side of a lateral join, including any expression returning an array.</p><h2>Filtering the results of a lateral join</h2><p>With the approach to lateral joins we just described, we can use the exploded item not only in the projections of a <code>SELECT</code>, but also in all the other places of the query where you can use fields coming from a source. This includes <code>WHERE</code> and <code>GROUP&nbsp;BY</code>.</p><p>Using the same example used above, this query allows you to keep only the readings greater than <code>90</code>:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;90</pre><h2>Nested lateral joins</h2><p>The result of a <code>LATERAL</code> is a table expression, so  it can be used inside the left-hand-side of a <code>LATERAL</code>. This can be useful when you want to extract elements inside a nested array.</p><p>Let's take  a slight modification of the <code>batched_readings</code> example:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[100,&nbsp;101],&nbsp;[102]]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[81],&nbsp;[82,&nbsp;81]]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[95,&nbsp;94],&nbsp;[93,&nbsp;96]]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[80,&nbsp;82]]&nbsp;}</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Here <code>nested_readings</code> is an array of arrays. We can get the same results as before with the following query:</p><pre>SELECT&nbsp;STREAM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_readings_nested</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;nested_readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;readings</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><h2>Working with multiple arrays</h2><p>The <code>EXPLODE</code> function approach allowed to specify multiple arrays to be exploded at the same time. When multiple <code>EXPLODE</code>s are used, the arrays are traversed in parallel, and elements with the same index are returned together.</p><p>To achieve similar behavior with <code>LATERAL</code> join it was enough to introduce a new <code>zip</code> array function: <code>zip</code> takes two (or more) arrays, it traverses them in parallel, and it builds a single new array where the elements are objects containing values from the original arrays.</p><p>For example, the following expression:</p><pre>zip([1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3],&nbsp;'a',&nbsp;['x',&nbsp;'y',&nbsp;'z'],&nbsp;'b')</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
will be evaluated to the following array:</p><pre>[{"a":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"b":&nbsp;"x"},&nbsp;{"a":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"b":&nbsp;"y"},&nbsp;{"a":&nbsp;3,&nbsp;"b":&nbsp;"z"}]</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Let's go back to our original example, and assume now we have a new array where the time of the reading was reported (the time is here a simple integer just to keep the code concise):</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[81,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;81],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[1,&nbsp;2]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[95,&nbsp;94,&nbsp;93,&nbsp;96],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[4,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;6,&nbsp;7]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[80,&nbsp;82],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[4,&nbsp;5]&nbsp;}</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
We can use <code>zip</code> to build an intermediate array that will then be passed to the <code>LATERAL</code> join:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading.value,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading.time</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_readings</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;zip(readings,&nbsp;'value',&nbsp;times,&nbsp;'time')&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><h2>Lateral joins for streaming data</h2><p>Something that we strive to achieve with Lenses <a href="https://lenses.io/product/sql/">SQL </a>is a consistent and seamless experience over all type of user data, be it static or streaming.</p><p>It will come as little surprise then that lateral joins are fully supported in our Streaming SQL as well as in our Snapshot one.</p><p>The syntax and concepts are the same the we have been explaining throughout this post, but now are used as part of an <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/streaming/">SQL Processor</a> rather than an <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/snapshot/">SQL Studio</a> query.</p><p>To illustrate how this would work, let's go back to our sensor meter example, and let's assume that we have the same <code>batched_readings</code> topic as before, which will receive events as below:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[81,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;81]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[95,&nbsp;94,&nbsp;93,&nbsp;96]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[80,&nbsp;82]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>....</pre><pre></pre><pre>....</pre><pre></pre><pre>....</pre><p>

What if we wanted to <i>split</i> our data to ensure that readings that are inside a <i>normal</i> range are sent downstream to be processed, but readings outside such …</p></div></div>

                        <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain"><em>Originally appeared in Coindesk on May 14 2019</em></a></p><p>There’s a certain kind of developer who states that blockchains are just <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13420777">terrible</a> databases. As the narrative goes, why not just use PostgreSQL for your application? It’s mature, robust, and high performance. Compared to relational databases, the skeptic claims that blockchains are just slow, clunky and expensive databases that don’t scale.</p><p>While some critiques of this critique are already out there (<a href="https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/why-blockchains-dont-suck-and-the-perils-of-distributed-databases-1a522cc7cfe1">1</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@chainfrog/5-reasons-that-blockchain-is-not-just-a-slow-database-55fe9d913578">2</a>), I’d propose a simple one sentence rebuttal: public blockchains are massively multiclient databases, where every user is a root user. They are useful for storing shared state between users, particularly when that shared state represents valuable data that users want to export without fail — like their money.</p><h2 id="the-data-export-import-problem"><strong>The data export/import problem</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png 1122w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>AWS has icons for everything, other than shared state between accounts.</figcaption></figure><p>To motivate public blockchains from the standpoint of a non-crypto engineer, take a look at the cloud diagrams for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/features/azure-architecture-diagram-tool/">Microsoft Azure</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/icons/">Google Cloud</a>. </p><p>There are icons for load balancers, transcoders, queues, and lambda functions. There are icons for VPCs and every type of database under the sun, including the new-ish <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/">managed blockchain</a> services (which are distinct from public blockchains, though potentially useful in some circumstances).</p><p>What there isn’t an icon for is <em>shared state between accounts</em>. That is, these cloud diagrams all implicitly assume that a single entity and its employees (namely, the entity with access to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html">cloud root account</a>) is the only one laying out the architecture diagram and reading from or writing to the application it underpins. More precisely, these diagrams typically assume the presence of a single economic actor, namely the entity paying the cloud bills.*</p><p>But if we visualize the cloud diagrams for not just one but one hundred corporate economic actors at a time, some immediate questions arise. Can these actors interoperate? Can their users pull their data out and bring it into other applications? And given that the users are themselves economic actors, if this data represents something of monetary value, can the users be confident that their data wasn’t modified during all this exporting and importing?</p><p>These are the types of questions that arise when we think about the data export and import from each entity’s application as a first-class requirement. And (with exceptions that we’ll get into), in general, the answer to these questions today is typically no.</p><p>No — different applications typically don’t have interoperable software, or allow their users to easily export/import their data in a standard form, or give users certainty that their data wasn’t intentionally tampered with or inadvertently corrupted during all the exporting and importing.</p><p>The reason why boils down to incentives. For most major internet services, there is simply <em>no financial incentive to enable users to export their data</em>, let alone to enable competitors to quickly import said data. While some call this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability">data portability</a> problem, let’s call it the data export/import problem to focus attention on the specific mechanisms for export and import.</p><h2 id="how-we-do-data-export-import-today-apis-json-pdf-csv-mbox-and-or-sftp"><strong>How we do data export/import today: APIs, JSON, PDF, CSV, MBOX, and/or SFTP</strong></h2><p>Even though the financial incentives aren’t yet present for a general solution to the data export/import problem, mechanisms have been created for many important special cases. These mechanisms include APIs, JSON/PDF/CSV exports, MBOX files, and (in a banking context) SFTP.</p><p>Let’s go through these in turn to understand the current state of affairs.</p><ul><li><strong>APIs.</strong> One of the most popular ways to export/import data is via Application Programming Interfaces, better known as APIs. Some businesses do let you get some of your data out, or give you the ability to write data to your account. But there’s a cost. First, their internal data format is typically proprietary and not an industry standard. Second, sometimes the APIs are not central to their core business and can be <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/twitter-apis-ending">turned off</a>. Third, sometimes the APIs are central to their core business and the price can be <a href="https://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/">dramatically raised</a>. In general, if you’re reading or writing to a hosted API, you’re at the mercy of the API provider. We call this platform risk, and being unceremoniously de-platformed has <a href="https://nordicapis.com/twitter-10-year-struggle-with-developer-relations/">harmed</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/meerkat-founder-on-getting-the-kill-call-from-twitter/">many</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/">a</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gmail-ifttt-shutdown-google/">startup</a>.</li><li><strong>JSON.</strong> Another related solution is to allow users or scripts to download JSON files, or read/write them to the aforementioned APIs. This is fine as far as it goes, but JSON is very free form and can describe virtually anything. For example, Facebook’s <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api">Graph API</a> and LinkedIn’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/profile-picture?context=linkedin/consumer/context">REST API</a> deal with similar things but return very different JSON results.</li><li><strong>PDF.</strong> Another very partial solution is to allow users to export a PDF. This works for documents, as PDF is an <a href="https://blog.marconet.com/blog/bid/326753/8-types-of-pdf-standards-each-serves-a-unique-purpose">open standard</a> that can be read by other applications like Preview, Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, Dropbox, and so on. But a PDF is meant to be an end product, to be read by a human. It’s not meant to be an input to any application besides a PDF viewer.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>.</strong> The humble comma separated value file gets closer to what we want for a general solution to the data import/export problem. Unlike the backend of a proprietary API, CSV is a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml">standard format</a> described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">RFC 4180</a>. Unlike JSON, which can represent almost anything, a CSV typically represents just a table. And unlike a PDF, a CSV can typically be edited locally by a user via a spreadsheet or used as machine-readable input to a local or cloud application. Because most kinds of data can be represented in a relational database, and because relational databases can usually be <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/sql-copy.html">exported</a> as a set of possibly gigantic CSVs, it’s also pretty general. However, CSVs are disadvantaged in a few ways. First, unlike a proprietary API, they aren’t hosted. That is, there’s no single canonical place to read or write a CSV representing (say) a record of transactions or a table of map metadata. Second, CSVs aren’t tamper resistant. If a user exports a record of transactions from service A, modifies it, and re-uploads it to service B, the second service would be none the wiser. Third, CSVs don’t have built-in integrity checks to protect against inadvertent error. For example, the columns of a CSV don’t have explicit type information, which means that a column containing the months of the year from 1-12 could have its type auto-converted upon import into a simple integer, causing <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/318420/formatting-a-comma-delimited-csv-to-force-excel-to-interpret-value-as-a-string">confusion</a>.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">MBOX</a>.</strong> While less well known than CSV, the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000383.shtml">MBOX format</a> for representing collections of email messages is the closest thing out there to a standardized data structure built for import and export between major platforms and independent applications alike. Indeed, there have been <a href="https://mobisocial.stanford.edu/papers/hotpets11.pdf">papers</a> proposing the use of MBOX in contexts outside of email. While CSV represents tabular data, MBOX represents a type of log-structured data. It’s essentially a single huge plain text file of email messages in chronological order, but can also represent <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-mbox-files-store-images-file-attachments-of-emails">images/file attachments</a> via MIME. Like CSV, MBOX files are an <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000383.shtml">open standard</a> and can be exported, edited locally, and reimported. And like CSV, MBOX has the disadvantages of no canonical host or intrinsic data integrity check.</li><li><strong><a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/">SFTP</a>.</strong> Before we move on, there’s one more data export/import mechanism that deserves mention: the secure file transfer protocol, or SFTP. While quite old-fashioned, this is actually the way that individuals send ACH payments back and forth to each other. Essentially, financial institutions use SFTP servers to take in electronic transaction data in <a href="https://secureinstantpayments.com/sip/help/interface_specs/external/NACHA_format.pdf">specially formatted files</a> and transmit it to the Federal Reserve each day to sync ACH debits and credits with each other (see <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/">here</a>, <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-2/">here</a>, <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-3/">here</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-4/">here</a>).</li></ul><p>Each of these mechanisms is widely used. But they are insufficient for enabling the general case of tamper-resistant import and export of valuable data between arbitrary economic actors — whether they be corporate entities, individual users, or headless scripts. For that, we need public blockchains.</p><h2 id="how-public-blockchains-solve-the-data-import-export-problem"><strong>How public blockchains solve the data import/export problem</strong></h2><p>Public blockchains enable shared state by incentivizing interoperability. They convert many types of data import/export problems into a general class of shared state problems. And they do so in part by incorporating many of the best features of the mechanisms described above.</p><ul><li><strong>A canonical API without centralization.</strong> Public blockchains provide canonical methods for read/write access like a hosted corporate API, but without the same platform risk. No single economic actor can shut down or deny service to clients of a decentralized public blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</li><li><strong>Lossless import/export.</strong> Public blockchains also enable individual users to export critical data to their local computer or to a new application like JSON/CSV/MBOX (either by sending out funds or exporting private keys) while providing cryptographic guarantees of data integrity.</li><li><strong>Incentivized interoperation.</strong> Public blockchains provide a means for arbitrary economic actors (whether corporations, individual users, or programs) to seamlessly interoperate. Every economic actor who reads from a public blockchain sees the same result, and any economic actor with sufficient funds can write to a public blockchain in the same way. No account setup is necessary and no actor can be blocked from read/write access.</li><li><strong>Cryptographic data integrity.</strong> And perhaps most importantly, public blockchains give financial incentives for interoperability and data integrity.</li></ul><p>This last point deserves elaboration. A public blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum typically records the transfer of things of monetary value. This thing could be the intrinsic cryptocurrency of the chain, a token issued on top of the chain, or another kind of digital asset.</p><p>Because the data associated with a public blockchain represents something of monetary value, it finally …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

				<p>Monitoria is a service you can use to monitor your website and get alerted when something goes wrong. Today we are introducing SSL certificate monitoring.</p>
<p>It’s a general consensus that every website should use an SSL certificate and communicate through an encrypted connection.</p>
<p>However, certificates will expire. Automation will fail, or the renewal is forgotten. When this happens, your users will see a scary warning instead of your site. Or your service will have an outage. This happened countless times <a href="#link-1">[1]</a><a href="#link-2">[2]</a><a href="#link-3">[3]</a>.</p>
<div>

        </p>
    </div>
    <p>A website with an expired SSL certificate</p>
</div>

<p>The main purpose of the SSL certificate monitoring is to remind you before your certificate expires.</p>
<p>Monitoria will check the certificate every 24 hours. When your certificate is close to expiration, you will receive a notification. Notification will be sent 30 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the expiration. Then every 24 hours, when SSL connection can’t be established.</p>
<p>To establish an SSL connection, the whole SSL certificate chain must be valid. That’s why Monitoria will also verify the expiration time of all intermediate and root certificates.</p>

    <p>Overview of the SSL monitor</p>
</div>
<p>To create an SSL monitor, open the Dashboard and click on the New SSL Monitor button. Fill in the URL you want to monitor and click on the Create Monitor button.</p>
<p>That’s it. Two clicks can save you from a big outage.</p>
<p>You can find more information about SSL monitoring in <a href="https://monitoria.ca/docs#ssl-monitoring">our documentation</a>.</p>

						<p>Whenever you read news about researchers killing cancer cells, you must first remind yourself of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1217/">an XKCD comic</a> before getting too excited. In the case of a recent Scripps study, it may be possible to target and kill only cancerous cells in lymphoma patients. </p><p>More than 20,000 people die of lymphoma every year in the United States. Lymphoma is a category of cancers that originate in immune system cells called lymphocytes that battle infection. Some current lymphoma therapies are indiscriminately aimed and largely wiped out of B cells. A more precise approach, with natural killer cells, immune cells, which patrol the blood stream and tissue, has been created. </p><p>These warriors in the immune system can recognize some tell-tale surface molecules that cause serious damage or malignancy to a cell. To tackle this disease, scientists altered NK-92MI cells to minimize lymphoma cancer without harming healthy cells. These NK-92MI cells are spread throughout the body when infused in the bloodstream.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TnO474Zou0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The cells can recognize some tell-tale surface molecules that cause serious damage or malignancy to a cell and can then destroy this objective cell by a range of means, including by secreting proteins which punch holes in the outer membrane of the cells. The scientists re-engineered NK-92MI cells with the goal of including a surface molecule that binds to a B-cell surface receptor. The alteration in cell cultivation experiments has greatly increased the capacity of NK cells to destroy lymphoma.</p><p>A new molecule named Sialyl-Lewis X was then &nbsp;introduced to the NK cells by the development of the cells in the bone marrow between the lymphoma cells. With this treatment, the development of lymphoma in the mice has been significantly delayed.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1576086631093-32b333463801?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fGNhbmNlciUyMGNlbGxzfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Human colon cancer cells with the cell nuclei stained red and the protein E-cadherin stained green.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>
									Welcome to the third interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most interesting founders in technology and commerce - Tobi Lütke, Founder
									and CEO of Shopify. This interview was published on December 16th, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Tobi is one of the most thoughtful and first principles oriented founders I've met and
								this was a fascinating conversation. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Tobi Lütke.</strong></em>
							</p><p>
								Here’s the honest answer: obviously I have a schedule and people helping me manage my
								time, however, I think a lot about where to devote my attention. In this way, there is
								no typical day.

							</p><p>My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have. Even back in the day
								when Shopify went public, I spent a good deal of time pre-selling the various investors.
								During meetings, I would say, “Hey, I'm here, and we've been doing this roadshow, but I
								actually spend a lot of my time on the product.” This was to set expectations because I
								knew I wasn't going to attend very many investor conferences. Fundamentally, my
								attention belonged to the product, not to the sales and marketing of it. </p><p>A day in my life really depends on what's happening. That said, usually I have themes.
								For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the
								things I am trying to figure out. </p><p>
								These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how
								would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to
								make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the
								calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it's incredibly easy—and it has
								happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this,
								there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the
								kind of things that have to be done.

							</p><p>So, I end up trying to insert themes into my days. Like today, for instance, I have a
								meeting with my small team to begin the week; I reserved my afternoon for product
								reviews—what we call “greenpathing exercises”—where, oddly, I'm trying to discern how
								everyone is thinking about the main things we're working on. I do this because
								oftentimes I feel as though I am the connective tissue combining operations, finance,
								and more formal business functions with the product itself. This connection helps me to
								make good decisions.</p><p>Lastly, on Wednesdays, Shopify doesn't do scheduled meetings. Usually, I have a list of
								memos to read or reactions to record to various mock-ups and so on. This is basically my
								very loosely defined schedule.</p><p>
								<b><i>How do you work with your so-called “expansion pack team” on reallocating your
										portfolio management on time? What does that loop look like?
									</i></b>
							</p><p>
								A lot of this is almost automatic by just having a good color coding system, which is
								really fun.
								<i>[laughs]</i>

							</p><p> At one point, I started complaining about blue weeks where every single time slot was
								taken. And someone said, “Well, if you don't like blue, I can make any color.” And I
								replied, “Well, how about we color based on leverage?” And that’s just what we did. </p><p>
								We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related
								things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced
								week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the
								product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects,
								and one-on-ones.

							</p><p>
								And so, if my calendar becomes too external or too much of anything, it's the first
								thing we see when we sit down for our priorities meeting. This makes scheduling a lot
								easier.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										This is a very natural segue to my next question. One of the theories behind
										this whole set of interviews is diving into the atomic bits of how we spend our
										time in meetings. This time compounds over the long term and has a massive
										effect. What does a good meeting with Tobi look like? Alternatively, what does a
										bad meeting with you look like?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<p>So actually, agendas are not terribly successful with me. I admire how other CEOs I’ve
								spoken with always have a strict agenda where everyone has a speaking slot. I find that
								absolutely fascinating. Even if I really set myself to an agenda and say, “Okay, great,
								this is going to happen,” I can't get through half of a meeting like this. Partly
								because a good meeting is, for me personally, when I learn something.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
										just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
										incorrect...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							<p>
								I started a company because I love learning. I went into programming because I found it
								fascinating. During meetings, I just love to hear the things that teams have discovered.
								When you're discussing an idea or a decision, I want to know what has been considered.
								To be honest, I find myself more interested in the inputs of an idea than the actual
								decision. I say this because when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
								just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
								incorrect. This is actually something that I have to explain to people that I work with.
								If I like someone's idea, I tend to do the same thing: I try to poke holes in it.
							</p>

							<p>I usually say, “Well, the implication of this choice means you've made the following
								assumptions. What inputs did you use to make these foundational assumptions?”
								Effectively, I'm trying to figure out if an idea is built on solid fundamentals. I find
								that shaky fundamentals tend to be where things often go wrong. The decision being
								discussed could be the perfect decision according to the various assumptions that
								everyone came into the room with. But if those assumptions are faulty, the seemingly
								perfect decision is faulty too. Interestingly, assumptions are rarely mentioned in the
								briefing docs or in the slide deck. Usually, I'm trying to make sure those are rock
								solid. Through this process, I invariably end up learning something completely new about
								a field. That gives me great confidence and comfort both in the decision and the
								direction.</p>

							
							<h2 id="enneagrams"><b>On Enneagrams and Comprehensivists</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>Two words have come up a lot in preparatory conversations: comprehensivist and
										enneagrams. Could you talk about both?

									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>Interesting.</p>
							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								I feel like I'm becoming known for pointing people towards the enneagram. I actually
								don't think it's that valuable on its own. The valuable thing about any of these
								personality-type constructs is that they do a really good job of teaching people that
								other people are very different. That realization is probably one of the biggest growth
								moments for people in general. It tells you that different people play different roles.
								On that note, I do think that, ideally, people should play their own roles really,
								really well.

							</p>
							<p>
								I play the role of challenger, personally. I find that the enneagram helps me remind
								myself that with different people I have to talk about the same things in different
								ways. I think it allows you to skip some time which would otherwise be touch and go at
								the beginning of a relationship and helps build trust better. In short, it enables us to
								have fruitful and effective conversations.
								And comprehensivist, I mean, that's a fancy word.
							</p>
							<p>

								<i>[Laughs]</i> I don't think I've ever used it outside of putting it into my Twitter
								bio when I was reading Buckminster Fuller. That said, I do like range. I find that the
								first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto
								principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
								in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.

								</p><blockquote>
									<p>..creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
										in another field in different ways...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							
						


							<h2 id="decisionmaking"><b>On Time and Attention on Shopify<br></b></h2>
							<p>
								<b><i>
										You try and design how your company spends time and attention. One particular
										incident came up recently which I found really fascinating. You wrote a script
										to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and
										what you ended up learning from it.


									</i></b>
							</p>


							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								So, going back a little bit further there—you know what, I should talk about books. One
								thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly
								veiled as a public company.

							</p>
							<p>We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one
								person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think
								Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…” </p>

							<p>Now, I come from an engineering perspective. One of my biggest beefs with engineers, in
								general, is …</p></div></div>

December 17, 2020 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>The most used tool for voice user interfaces on the browser is the Web Speech API and SpeechRecognition API, but there are major limitations with both technologies.</p><p>First, Web Speech API is <a href="https://caniuse.com/speech-recognition">only available</a> for Chrome. SpeechRecognition API is also available for Firefox and some derivates of these, but the low support makes them unfeasible for production use in any real-life application.</p><p><img src="https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/webspeech-api-support.png" alt="Support for WebSpeech API is limited"></p><p>Second, Web Speech API and SpeechRecognition API provides only the transcription of the user's speech. They don't provide any context or meaning (natural language understanding) for this input. While in some use cases that only need the transcription it's not an issue, for more complicated user tasks and for building user interfaces natural language understanding needs to be solved somehow.</p><p>Speechly is the first developer tool built from the ground up for building <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/what-is-voice-user-interface">voice user interfaces</a>. Our Spoken Language Understanding API integrates <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/blog/nlu-voice-speech-recognition-terms-glossary/#s">speech recognition</a> (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) to a single Spoken Language Understanding API for low latency and improved accuracy.</p><p>In addition to wide browser support, Speechly is available for touch screen platforms (Android, iOS and React Native) which makes building cross-platform applications very simple. This makes Speechly the best WebSpeech API alternative for voice user interfaces.</p><h2>What is natural language understanding and why do I need that?</h2><p>Natural language understanding is a branch of machine learning that enables computer systems to extract meaning from text or speech input. It reduces natural language into structured data that typically consists of intents and entities (slots) that modify these intents.</p><p>While this might sound complicated, let's give a simple example to clarify it. If the user says something like "Show t-shirts", the user intent is probably something like "show_products" and it has an entity "t-shirt". Naturally, the user might also say something like "Show jeans". In this case, the entity would be the same – "show_products" but the entity would be "jeans".</p><p>If we are 100% sure that our users will always use either of these two utterances in exactly this format, we can use a very simple regular expression as our natural language understanding algorithm.</p><p>But most often this is not the case. Rather, the user can express this same intent in many different ways. Maybe they say something like "I'd like to see turtlenecks" or "Do you have any tees?"</p><p>A good natural language understanding algorithm can extract the meaning out of all these utterances and always return with the same intent and entity, no matter how the user expresses themselves.</p><p>WebSpeech and SpeechRecognition APIs don't have any natural language understanding capabilities and if you need that, you'll need to start learning <a href="https://spacy.io/">SpaCy</a> or some other natural language understanding tool. This increases development time significantly and adds complexity.</p><h2>Why Spoken Language Understanding?</h2><p>Now as we've learned, a voice user interface needs two distinct parts: speech recognition to transform user speech into text and natural language understanding to extract meaning (intents and entities) from that text. WebSpeech and SpeechRecognition APIs only offer speech recognition.</p><p>If you have ever used Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri, you've probably seen that while the text transcript appears in near real-time while the user speaks, when the user stops speaking there is a small delay after which the action happens. This is where the natural language understanding happens and the action that the user wanted is performed.</p><p>Speechly is a Spoken Language Understanding API that provides both of these functions in a fully streaming fashion. When the user starts talking, the API begins returning both the transcript and the "meaning", eg. intents and entities for this input. This makes applications built with Speechly very responsive and fast to react to user input.</p><p>In fact, Speechly returns both interim and final results for both the transcript and for intents and entities for even faster feedback.</p><p>Unlike SpeechRecognition or WebSpeech API, Speechly <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/web-client/">browser-client</a> is supported by <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/supported-browsers/">all modern browsers</a> on mobile and desktop. You can also use Speechly for iOS and Android and we are adding more client libraries in the future, too. You can find all our client libraries <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/">here</a> for up-to-date status.</p><p>The streaming fashion of Speechly enables natural end-user utterances such as "Show me t-shirts... sorry I mean jeans". For most other voice UI APIs, this kind of query fails because of end pointing (or failure in natural language understanding): the system recognizes the small pause in between as a signal for the end and starts processing the first part of the utterance without taking into account the last part.</p><p>Another important thing that streaming enables is real-time visual feedback. If we think about our example utterance "Show t-shirts" it can show the t-shirts as soon as the user has stopped speaking. This encourages the user to go on and they can continue with something like "for men... in size large".</p><p>Configuring the natural language understanding model on Speechly is very simple and can be done either in our web dashboard or by using our command line tools. The former works great for simple projects and initial models and the latter is better for projects with several developers collaborating on the same model.</p><h2>Spoken Language Understanding demo</h2><p>Here's a quick demo showing this a web application built with Speechly Spoken Language Understanding in action:</p><p>As you can see from the demo, real-time visual feedback is the key to natural voice user interfaces. We believe that the lack of real-time feedback is the reason, why <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/real-time-voice-user-interfaces">the "iPhone moment" has not happened yet</a> for voice UIs.

    <p>In February, I will be teaching a new course on Functional Programming at TU Delft. The course will mostly cover Haskell using <a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html">Graham Hutton’s excellent book</a>, though there will be a part on basic usage of dependent types in Agda towards the end as well. For the exercises, we will use the Delft-grown <a href="https://weblab.tudelft.nl/">Weblab platform</a> for letting the students code and run the automated tests using QuickCheck. Unfortunately for me, the book does not talk about QuickCheck at all. Fortunately for you, that means I decided to write a tutorial myself, which you can read here.</p>
<p>Of course there are many excellent QuickCheck tutorials out there already. However I found all of them either assumed too much Haskell knowledge (since I want to introduce QuickCheck as early as possible), skipped out on interesting parts (such as conditional and quantified properties), or were just not up-to-date with the latest version of QuickCheck (such as the new approach for generating random functions using <code>Fun</code>). So I hope this post closes a gap in the current menu of tutorials for at least a few people.</p>
<p>If you spot any errors or opportunities for improvement, please let me know. The students at TU Delft will be grateful!</p>

<p>When you were first learning to program, at some point you were probably told about the importance of writing <em>unit tests</em>: small test cases that each test a small piece of functionality of your code. And while it is true that writing unit tests is important, it is also at the same time <em>boring</em> and <em>difficult</em>. It is boring because you need to write many separate unit tests for each piece of functionality, which all look more or less the same. And it is difficult because it is very easy to miss a certain combination of inputs for which the program crashes. Would it not be nice if we could just write down how the program should behave and have the test cases be generated automatically? That is precisely the approach of <strong>property-based testing</strong>.</p>
<p>In short, property-based testing is an approach to testing where you as the programmer write down properties that you expect to hold of your program. When running the tests, the test runner will generate a lot of different random input values, and then check that the property holds for all these (combinations of) input values. Compared to writing individual unit tests, property-based testing has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You spend <strong>less time writing test code</strong>: a single property can often replace many hand-written test cases.</li>
<li>You get <strong>better coverage</strong>: by randomly generating inputs, QuickCheck will test lots of combinations you’d never test by hand.</li>
<li>You spend <strong>less time on diagnosis of errors</strong>: if a property fails to hold, QuickCheck will automatically produce a minimized counterexample.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>QuickCheck</strong> is a tool for property-based testing of Haskell code. Since its introduction for Haskell in 1999, QuickCheck has become very popular as a testing framework and has been ported to many other programming languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Scala, and many others (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck</a> for a more complete list). However, QuickCheck really benefits from the fact that Haskell is a pure language, so that is where the approach continues to be the most powerful.</p>
<p>This introduction will show you the basic usage of QuickCheck for testing properties of Haskell code, as well as how to use alternative random generators. All the functions that are used come from the module <code>Test.QuickCheck</code> from the QuickCheck package. This package can be installed using the Cabal package manager for Haskell by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cabal install QuickCheck</code></pre>

<p>To write a QuickCheck test case, all you have to do is define a Haskell function that defines a <strong>property</strong> of your program that you expect to hold. In the simplest case, a property is just a value of type <code>Bool</code>. For example, suppose we have written a simple Haskell function to calculate the distance between two integers:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>distance ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">distance x y <span>=</span> <span>abs</span> (y<span>-</span>x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can then express the property that the distance between <code>3</code> and <code>5</code> equals <code>2</code>:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>prop_dist35 ::</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">prop_dist35 <span>=</span> distance <span>3</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By convention, names of QuickCheck properties always start with <code>prop_</code>. We can express more general properties by defining a function that returns a <code>Bool</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>-- The distance between any number and itself is always 0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>prop_dist_self ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">prop_dist_self x <span>=</span> distance x x <span>==</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>-- The distance between x and y is equal to the distance between y and x</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><span>prop_dist_symmetric ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">prop_dist_symmetric x y <span>=</span> distance x y <span>==</span> distance y x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When testing a property that takes one or more inputs, QuickCheck will randomly generate several inputs (100 by default) and check that the function returns <code>True</code> for all inputs.</p>
<p>The main function used to call QuickCheck is <code>quickCheck</code>, which is defined in the module <code>Test.QuickCheck</code>. To import it, you can either add <code>import Test.QuickCheck</code> at the top of your file or import it manually if you are working from GHCi. Assuming you have installed the QuickCheck package, you can then load the file and run tests by calling <code>quickCheck</code>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>&gt;</span> ghci</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>GHCi</span>, version <span>8.10</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>:</span> https<span>://</span>www<span>.</span>haskell<span>.</span>org<span>/</span>ghc<span>/</span>  <span>:?</span> for help</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>Loaded</span> package environment from <span>~/.</span>ghc<span>/</span>x86_64<span>-</span>linux<span>-</span><span>8.10</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>/</span>environments<span>/</span>default</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>l QuickCheckExamples.hs</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist35</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>1</span> test<span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>QuickCheck tells us that everything is as it should be: it ran the test and got the result <code>True</code>. Since there are no inputs to the test, it is run only once. Let us try out some more properties!</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist_self</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist_symmetric</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Huge success! For each of the tests, QuickCheck has generated 100 random inputs and verified that for each one the property returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>To get more information about the test inputs that are generated by QuickCheck, you can replace the function <code>quickCheck</code> with <code>verboseCheck</code>. This will print out each individual test case as it is generated. Try it out for yourself!</p>
<h2 id="shrinking-counterexamples">Shrinking counterexamples</h2>
<p>What happens if there’s a mistake in our code? Say we forgot to write <code>abs</code> in the definition of <code>distance</code>?</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist_symmetric</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>***</span> <span>Failed</span><span>!</span> <span>Falsified</span> (after <span>2</span> tests)<span>:</span>                  </span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>QuickCheck has found a counterexample: if the first input <code>x</code> is 0 and the second input <code>y</code> is 1, then <code>y-x</code> is not equal to <code>x-y</code>.</p>
<p>When QuickCheck finds a counterexample, it will not always return the first one it encounters. Instead, QuickCheck will look for the smallest counterexample it can find. As an example, let us try to run QuickCheck on the (false) property stating that every list is sorted.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>sorted ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> </span>
<span id="cb8-2">sorted (x<span>:</span>y<span>:</span>ys) <span>=</span> x <span>&lt;=</span> y <span>&amp;&amp;</span> sorted (y<span>:</span>ys)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">sorted _        <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><span>-- A (false) property stating that every list is sorted</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>prop_sorted ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">prop_sorted xs <span>=</span> sorted xs</span></code></pre></div>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>&gt;</span> verboseCheck prop_sorted</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>Passed</span><span>:</span>  </span>

<p>The first list that is generated that is not sorted is <code>[2,1,3]</code>. Note that this will be a different list every time we run QuickCheck since it is randomly generated. However, QuickCheck does not stop there and instead tries smaller and smaller lists until it converges to a minimal counterexample: <code>[1,0]</code>. This process is called <strong>shrinking</strong>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that despite the inherent randomness of QuickCheck, shrinking will often converge to one of a small set of minimal counterexamples. For example, if we run <code>quickCheck</code> many times on <code>prop_sorted</code>, we always end up with either <code>[1,0]</code> or <code>[0,-1]</code> as a counterexample.</p>
<p>The precise strategy that QuickCheck uses for shrinking counterexamples depends on the type of the counterexample:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For numeric types such as <code>Int</code>, QuickCheck will try a random number that is smaller in absolute value (i.e.&nbsp;closer to 0).</p></li>
<li><p>For booleans of type <code>Bool</code>, QuickCheck will try to replace <code>True</code> with <code>False</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For tuple types <code>(a,b)</code>, QuickCheck will try to shrink one of the components.</p></li>
<li><p>For list types, QuickCheck will try to either delete a random element from the list, or try to shrink one of the values in the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing-many-properties-at-once">Testing many properties at once</h2>
<p>Instead of running individual tests from GHCi, you can also combine all your tests in a <code>main</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">  quickCheck prop_dist35</span>
<span id="cb10-3">  quickCheck prop_dist_self</span>
<span id="cb10-4">  quickCheck prop_dist_symmetric</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This code makes use of Haskell <code>do</code> keyword that we will study in the chapter on monads. Once you have defined this <code>main</code> function, you can invoke it by calling <code>runghc</code> from the command line:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>&gt;</span> runghc QuickcheckExamples.hs</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>1</span> test<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that a file may only contain a single <code>main</code> function. In a realistic project, we would instead create a separate file that just defines all QuickCheck properties and puts them together in a <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> When you are writing code in the WebLab instance for this course, you do not need to write a main function for QuickCheck tests: WebLab will automatically collect all functions in the <code>Test</code> tab whose name starts with <code>prop_</code> and run <code>quickCheck</code> on each one.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge in making effective use of QuickCheck lies in coming up with good properties to test. So let us take a look at some examples of good properties to test.</p>
<h2 id="roundtrip-properties">Roundtrip properties</h2>
<p>When one function is an inverse to another function, we can create a property test for that. For example, we can test that reversing a list is its own inverse:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>prop_reverse_reverse ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">prop_reverse_reverse xs <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> (<span>reverse</span> xs) <span>==</span> xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As another example, we can test that inserting an element into a list and then deleting it again …</p></article></div>

<p>There’s this narrative in the Bitcoin community that you may have heard: The government doesn’t care about you and is printing money with no conscience. Preserve your wealth with Bitcoin! Money printers go brrrr! </p>



<p>It makes Bitcoin sound virtuous. </p>



<p>But it’s a sales pitch.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll talk about how Bitcoin stacks up to gold as a hedge against inflation and why we don’t think wealth preservation is what really motivates most Bitcoin investors.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Bitcoin-Is-Compared-to-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Compared to Gold</h2>



<p>People call Bitcoin “digital gold” because both Bitcoin and gold have a limited supply. Unlike fiat/paper currency, which can be printed at the discretion of the government, Bitcoin will only ever have 21 millions coins unless +51% of its miners agree to change the protocol (which is highly unlikely). As for gold, there’s only so much that can be mined out of the earth.</p>



<h2 id="Why-Bitcoin-Is-Better-Than-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Better Than Gold</h2>



<p>Many believe Bitcoin is superior to gold because:</p>



<ol><li>It’s digital so potentially harder to get seized by the government or stolen by a criminal. (Of course, if someone knows you own Bitcoin, they could still threaten you with force or violence to access it). </li><li>It’s easy to send. Anyone with a basic internet connection and some sort of computing device can send/receive Bitcoin. But gold is not because it’s a physical object and a heavy one at that.</li><li>It’s easily verifiable through cryptographic technology.</li><li>It’s infinitely divisible, which of course gold is not. There’s actual a unit of currency called a Satoshi, and 1 Bitcoin equals 100 million Satoshis.</li><li>It is somewhat programmable (though not nearly as advanced as a <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/why-invest-in-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>).</li></ol>



<p>But Bitcoin has some important disadvantages:</p>



<ol><li>It’s not fully private. Because the Bitcoin ledger aka blockchain is open to the public, Bitcoin transactions can reveal information about the senders and recipients. Authorities have taken advantage of this lack of complete anonymity to catch criminals.</li><li>It’s not as widely accepted or trusted: by society, financial institutions, governments, etc.</li><li>It’s very speculative &amp; volatile and has a much shorter a track record.</li></ol>



<h2 id="The-Store-of-Value-Argument">The “Store of Value” Argument</h2>



<p>Because both Bitcoin and gold are scarce, people think Bitcoin can serve the same purpose as gold: act as a better store of value over paper money and hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>You may have heard worries over inflation because of governments printing money to provide financial relief due to Covid-19. Some notable investors, like Raoul Pal and Ray Dalio, have said so, too.</p>



<p>So in the eyes of many Bitcoin enthusiasts, one of the most compelling arguments in support of Bitcoin is the fact that it can preserve wealth from being inflated away.</p>



<p>(NOTE: We know <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-says-he-s-reminded-of-gold-in-70s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Tudor Jones</a> says that a store of value must have purchasing power, trustworthiness, liquidity and portability. But scarcity is what the majority of folks focus on).</p>



<h2 id="Is-Preserving-Wealth-What-People-Really-Care-About">Is Preserving Wealth What People Really Care About?</h2>



<p>Let’s rephrase this question a bit: Let’s say inflation was high at 10% per year. But a total stock market ETF gave a 15% return on the year. Would anyone give a rat’s ass about Bitcoin, if it kept up with inflation but <em>didn’t</em> beat the market?</p>



<p>We think not. Because, let’s be honest, the excitement around Bitcoin <em>as an “investment</em>” is its outstanding returns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people promote Bitcoin, arguing that it is the best inflation hedge. But protecting against inflation is not as important to them as seeing the price of Bitcoin go up. Because Bitcoin is scarce, getting more people to adopt Bitcoin as an inflation hedge drives up the price. So the justification is your wealth preservation. But the motivation is their wealth accumulation.</p>



<p><em>Now, does this detract from Bitcoin as a financial innovation? </em>No.</p>



<p><em>Does this mean Bitcoin does NOT act as a hedge against inflation? </em>No, it can despite other people’s ulterior motives advocating for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Does this stop us <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Prudes</a> from buying and hodling Bitcoin? </em>Not at all.</p>



<p>We just think it’s important to have clear eyes when betting on Bitcoin because Bitcoin as a “store of value” is not what is truly motivating current investors. The truth is they wanna see Bitcoin beat the pants off all other investments. Otherwise, nobody would really give a shit (us included). </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Language is a logical structure that, in theory, should be easy for a machine to work with. How difficult is it, really, to train an ML text analysis system? Let’s find out today.</p><h2 id="what-is-text-analysis-in-machine-learning%3F">What is text analysis in machine learning?</h2><p>Text analysis is the process of obtaining valuable insights from texts.</p><p>ML can work with different types of textual information such as social media posts, messages, and emails. Special software helps to preprocess and analyze this data.</p><h3 id="text-analysis-vs.-text-mining-vs.-text-analytics">Text analysis vs. text mining vs. text analytics</h3><p><strong>Text analysis</strong> and <strong>text mining</strong> are synonyms. They describe the same process of extracting meaning from data by observing patterns.</p><p>However, <strong>text analysis</strong> and <strong>text analytics</strong> are a bit different things:</p><ul>
<li>Text analysis works with the concepts, the meaning of the text. Text analysis can be used to answer these questions: is a review positive or negative? What is the main topic of the text?</li>
<li>Text analytics studies patterns. The results can be shown on graphs, schemes, and spreadsheets. If you want to estimate the percentage of positive customer feedback, you will need text analytics.</li>
</ul><p>In this post, we will talk about ML text analysis techniques and use cases.</p><h2 id="why-is-text-mining-important%3F">Why is text mining important?</h2><p>Every piece of content can be analyzed on a deeper level in order to understand more about the author or the topic of the text. By introducing ML text analysis, we can provide users with better services:</p><ul>
<li>provide answers to FAQs;</li>
<li>translate into different languages;</li>
<li>monitor public sentiment towards products and services;</li>
<li>facilitate paperwork through clustering and classification of documents.</li>
</ul><p>Companies become much more efficient at communicating with their customers: by studying customer feedback, a company can discover public opinion about their products. ML algorithms can automatically classify customer support tickets or reviews by topic or language they are written in.</p><p>ML makes textual analysis much faster and more efficient than manual processing of texts. It allows to reduce labor costs and speed up the processing of texts without compromising on quality.</p><h2 id="how-does-machine-learning-text-analysis-work%3F">How does machine learning text analysis work?</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/83/83p22f9a.1_(40)_(1).jpg" alt="data mining, data processing, and machine learning" loading="lazy"></p><p>What do you need to build a text analysis tool? Let’s look at it step-by-step.</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gather the data.</strong> Decide what information you will study and how you will collect it. These samples will be used to <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/machine-learning-testing">train and test your model</a>. There are two major types of information sources. If you go to resources such as forums or newspapers, then you are collecting <em>external data</em>. <em>Internal data</em> is what every person or company generates every day: emails, reports, chats, etc. Both internal and external resources can be valuable for text mining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare the data.</strong> Unstructured data needs to be prepared, or preprocessed. Otherwise, the program won’t understand it. In our blog, we have already talked about different strategies for <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/data-preprocessing">data preprocessing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply a machine learning algorithm for text analysis.</strong> You can write your algorithm from scratch or use a library. Pay attention to <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>, <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">TextBlob</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP">Stanford’s CoreNLP</a> if you are looking for something easily accessible for your study and research.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>These are the techniques used for ML text analysis:</p><h3 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h3><p>Every token is a meaningful unit. Words and punctuation are tokens, while whitespaces are not. Example: This post is about text analysis. = [“This”, “post”, “is”, “about”, “text”, “analysis”, “.”]</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/yq/yqlyeg6p.2_(31)_(1).jpg" alt="Tokenization" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="part-of-speech-tagging">Part-of-speech tagging</h3><p>When you assign a grammatical category to each token, it’s part-of-speech tagging.</p><p>Example: This post is about text analysis. = [“This”: ADJ, “post”: NOUN, “is”: VERB, “about”: PREP, “text”: NOUN, “analysis”: NOUN, “.”: PUNCT]</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/dd/ddr1bum1.3_(29)_(1).jpg" alt="Part of speech analysis" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="lemmatization">Lemmatization</h3><p>Putting the word back to its dictionary form (lemma) is done for natural language processing. You map all the possible forms of the word to one ‘root’ verb, and the machine will still understand it. ‘Being’, ‘was’, ‘were’ have the lemma ‘be’.</p><h3 id="stemming">Stemming</h3><p>By removing affixes from the word, you get the stem, ‘clean’ form of the word. Google uses stemming for indexing the requests. Instead of storing all the forms of the word, the lexicon is reduced to stems. The process becomes much faster but also less accurate than lemmatization. For instance, the stem or ‘Buying’ is simply ‘buy’.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/w7/w7c7raxz.4_(23)_(1).jpg" alt="Stemming" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="parsing">Parsing</h3><p>There are two kinds of parsing: dependency and constituency. You conduct parsing when you want to understand the grammatical structure of a sentence.</p><p>During <strong>constituency parsing,</strong> you break the text into sub-phrases, also called constituents. This helps to represent the structure of the sentence. Disadvantage: it is context-free grammar. In a sentence like ‘Visiting relatives can be boring’, the algorithm would fail to understand the ambiguous meaning. However, it’s good for grammar checking. For instance, it’s hard for Grammarly to parse a grammatically incorrect sentence, but, thanks to constituency parsing, it uses models of how the sentence should look like to find the right solution.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/v1/v142xc89.5_(19)_(1).jpg" alt="consitutency parsing" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Dependency parsing</strong> identifies the main words in the sentence and finds related words that modify their meaning. Syntactic relationships help to understand what the sentence means, especially in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language">synthetic languages</a> such as Slavic languages. Dependency parsing is also applied to grammar checking and word processing because it can parse free word order and fragmented sentences.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/fu/fuytdlvy.6_(9)_(1).jpg" alt="dependency parsing" loading="lazy"></p><p>For the demonstration, we have used the <a href="https://demo.allennlp.org/dependency-parsing">Allen NLP system</a> that determines the relationship between the words automatically with a neural network trained on a large dataset of texts.</p><h2 id="text-mining-techniques">Text mining techniques</h2><p>Now let us discover some of the approaches that allow you to work with textual data.</p><h3 id="word-frequency-analysis">Word frequency analysis</h3><p>This technique allows you to measure <a href="https://methods.sagepub.com/base/download/DatasetStudentGuide/word-frequency-analyse-political-language-moral">how frequently words appear in the text</a>.</p><p>This is exactly how humans are able to identify the topic of the text and conduct sentiment analysis. We know that the word “interesting” usually refers to positive impressions. So if you see this word in a review, that means that the client is satisfied. However, this method is not sensitive to sarcasm, which might affect the general results of your analysis.</p><h3 id="collocation-analysis">Collocation analysis</h3><p>Two, three, or more words that are often used together in speech are called collocations. The same word in different collocations can have different meanings. The word “free” means “liberated” as in “free spirit”. “Free” can also mean “free of charge”. “Free’ is much more likely to appear on an online store’s website together with “shipping”, rather than with “spirit” or even separately. <a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io/statistical-analysis/collocation/#:~:text=A%20collocation%20analysis%20allows%20us,on%20capitalization%20in%20English%20texts.&amp;text=You%20can%20also%20discover%20collocations%20longer%20than%20two%20words.">Taking collocations into account</a> makes semantic analysis more accurate.</p><h3 id="concordance-analysis">Concordance analysis</h3><p>A concordance is a table that displays different meanings of the same word in different contexts. Here is an example from a contextual dictionary showing how different people use the word “concordance”:</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/45/45j42sv0.8_(6)_(1).jpg" alt="Contextual dictionary" loading="lazy"></p><p>Contextual dictionaries are good for language learners because they contain real-life examples showing different ways of using the same word. They are just as good for machine translation and speech generation systems.</p><p>Concordance and collocation analysis are useful for keyword meaning disambiguation.</p><p>Using these basic techniques, you can proceed to more advanced types of ML text analysis.</p><h2 id="text-classification">Text classification</h2><p>ML algorithms detect different patterns in data and break the text into clusters. Let us talk a bit more about typical text classification tasks.</p><h3 id="sentiment-analysis">Sentiment analysis</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">Sentiment analysis</a>, or opinion mining, identifies and studies emotions in the text.</p><p>The emotions of the author are important for understanding texts. SA allows to classify opinion polarity about a new product or assess a brand’s reputation. It can also be applied to reviews, surveys, social media posts. The pro of SA is that it can effectively analyze even sarcastic comments.</p><h3 id="topic-analysis">Topic analysis</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">Topic modeling</a> classifies texts by subject and can make humans’ lives easier in many domains. Finding books in a library, goods in the store, customer support tickets in the CRM would be impossible without it. Text classifiers can be tailored to your needs.</p><h3 id="content-tagging">Content tagging</h3><p>Students and professors, lawyers, scientists and laboratory assistants can all benefit from the use of text classification technology. Since they are dealing with massive amounts of unstructured data on a daily basis, <a href="https://webtech.training.oregonstate.edu/faq/what-are-content-tags-used#:~:text=A%20content%20tag%2C%20in%20content,similarly%20tagged%20within%20the%20system.">tagging and classifying texts</a> into categories would make their lives much easier.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPqZ0N8OnFk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>With the help of text analysis, it is possible to extract keywords, prices, features, and other important information. A marketer can conduct competitor analysis and find out all about their prices and special offers in just a few clicks.</p><p>Techniques that help to identify keywords and measure their frequency are useful to summarize the contents of texts, find an answer to a question, index data, and generate word clouds.</p><h3 id="entity-recognition">Entity Recognition</h3><p>Entities are people, companies, or locations mentioned in the text. It can be useful in machine translation so that the program wouldn’t translate last names or brand names. Moreover, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-entities">entity recognition</a> is indispensable for market analysis and competitor analysis in business.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SUzf6252_0?start=260" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="practical-applications-of-ml-text-analysis">Practical applications of ML text analysis</h2><p>What are the practical applications of ML text analysis techniques? We’ve tried to mention the most common ones.</p><h3 id="natural-language-processing">Natural language processing</h3><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language">NLP</a> is what helps the machines to comprehend human language and act according to the requests.

<h2 id="2-the-lessaudiogreater-tag">2. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>⁣<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element provides a way to add audio resources to a web page without the need to use any other plugin.⁣ It's used to play a sound much as music or an audio stream. It supports mp3, wav and ogg.
⁣
A fallback text is enclosed within the tag to be shown to browsers that don't support the element.⁣
⁣
By default, the browser does not show any controls. ⁣
To add the ability for users to play, pause, adjust volume, etc. the 'controls' attribute can be used.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>audio</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"music.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- ## AWS re:Invent 2020 Day 10: The Future of Cloud Runs on ARM -->
<p>Graviton2, AWS’ latest generation of ARM-based processors, was announced a year ago at re:Invent 2019. But the amount of times Graviton2 was mentioned in re:Invent 2020 keynotes almost made me believe it was this year’s major announcement. Let’s look at why Amazon seems to be all in on ARM, and what to expect in the coming years.</p>
<h3>The history of ARM and x86</h3>
<p>ARM has been around since the 1980’s. The company Arm Ltd. (also known as Arm Holdings) designs processor architectures and cores based on a reduced instruction set (RISC). The designs for these architectures and cores are licensed to third parties, who use them to design their own microcontrollers (MCUs), Systems-on-Chips (SOCs) and CPUs. Examples are Qualcomm’s Snapdragon, Apple’s mobile CPUs (A4, A5, currently up to A14), Apple’s desktop CPU M1, and Amazon’s Graviton and Graviton2 processors. There are hundreds of other types of processors built on ARM architecture, but these are some of the most famous ones.</p>
<p>ARM processors were originally designed for use in personal computers. However, their efficiency and the fact that third parties could design their own specialized SOCs and CPUs around the ARM core made ARMs especially popular for embedded devices like printers, network appliances and mobile devices. Windows’ rise to dominance on the desktop market, combined with its requirement for the x86 architecture, seemed to seal ARMs faith for use in small, efficient devices only.</p>
<p>Since the start of the century, smartphones have become ubiquitous. These devices need to be small and efficient, which made ARM processors a logical choice. In fact, almost every smartphone runs on ARM. The first iPhone was based on a Samsung 32-bit RISC ARM processor, and the first Android phone - the HTC Dream - was based on a Qualcomm ARM11 processor. There have been a few phones based on the x86 instruction set, but none have been successful.</p>
<p>At the same time, the x86 processors produced by Intel and AMD started to run into their design limits. For decades, these processors became more powerful by increasing their clock speed - they simply were able to run more operations per second. But somewhere between 4GHz and 5GHz, increasing the clock speed became nearly impossible; the increased speed required higher voltages, which led to higher temperatures which had to be channeled away. At some point these CPUs either needed giant cooling systems or they would simply melt. The solution was to introduce multiple cores in a single CPU. Each of these cores was limited at a certain speed, but by executing multiple processes in parallel systems could still become faster. To increase the utilization of these cores, multithreading was invented. With multithreading, a single core could time-share its capacity, allowing two or more threads to run semi-simultaneously on a single core. To make this work, an SMT (simultaneous multithreading) controller had to be added to the CPU. The SMT controller managed and assigned different threads for the CPUs cores. However,  SMT itself uses power, which made multithreading CPUs less efficient. Adding more components also made CPUs more complex and expensive. And as we will see in a later section, SMT controllers introduced new security risks.</p>
<h3>Linux, Raspberry Pi, smartphones and the Apple M1</h3>
<p>Although Windows could not run on ARM, Linux has been supporting desktops on ARM since about the year 2000. Propelled by the introduction of the Raspberry Pi in 2012, many developers and hobbyists have been experimenting with running full-fledged operating systems and desktops on ARM platforms. Additionally, the lucrative smartphone market pushed mobile phone developers to create ever faster and more efficient processors. Apple introduced their A4 SOC in the iPhone 4, and they have been pushing the performance of their ARM processors every year since. In 2018, Anandtech <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets/4">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is quite astonishing, is just how close Apple’s A11 and A12 are to current desktop CPUs. I haven’t had the opportunity to run things in a more comparable manner, but taking our server editor, Johan De Gelas’ recent figures from earlier this summer, we see that the A12 outperforms a moderately-clocked Skylake CPU in single-threaded performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been a turning point in the history of processors. Since 2018, ARM processors have proven to be more powerful, efficient, secure and cheaper than their x86 siblings. Additionally, the performance growth path for x86 seems to be plateauing, while there is a lot of room for performance improvement in the ARM architecture. With these facts it came as no surprise that Apple started looking into running their personal computer line on ARM years ago. This year they finally released their MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with the M1 CPU, based on the ARMv8.6-A architecture.</p>
<p>With Apple moving towards ARM, Amazon doing the same, almost all smartphones running ARM now and in the foreseeable future, and the existing market for embedded devices, the future looks bright for ARM. Nvidia definitely seems to agree - they acquired Arm Holdings from Softbank for a cool <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai">40 billion</a> in September 2020.</p>
<h3>Arguments for ARM-based servers</h3>
<p>Driven by ARM’s increasing popularity, many software platforms, operating systems (including Windows nowadays!), applications and libraries support the AArch64 (ARM 64-bit) architecture. These include popular web server applications like NginX and Apache, databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and programming languages like Python and Java.</p>
<p>With this broad support, switching from x86 to AArch64 is not quite as difficult as it used to be. There might be some compatibility issues, but most applications should be able to migrate without too much effort. This means there is a giant market of potential customers of ARM-based servers. But why would customers want to migrate?</p>
<p>The answer is the obvious and only argument for any migration: money. An ARM processor is cheaper than an Intel or AMD processor, while - as discussed above - ARM equals or even tops x86 performance. Depending on your workload, AWS’ Graviton2 processors can offer up to 40% better price/performance than comparable x86 chips. And while 40% is only achievable in ideal situations, even 20% is very significant!</p>
<p>Another driver for ARM based servers is security. As stated earlier the SMT controller adds additional complexity to processors. The controller also needs access to all the cores and threads on the CPU to effectively manage them. Through a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-expose-a-new-vulnerability-in-intels-cpus/">recent vulnerability</a> attackers were able to abuse SMT to access sensitive data from other cores. This is especially important in public cloud environments, where customers almost always share physical hardware with other customers. The Graviton2 architecture shares no cache or threads between different cores: every thread runs on a single core with its own L1 and L2 cache.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/6YwGWEdHD71N8jN3710Ud3/4ef35329d5b30550f28d02a3946561b8/separate_cores.jpg?fit=scale&amp;w=920" alt="Separate Cores"></p>
<h3>Driving sustainability with Graviton2</h3>
<p>In the infrastructure keynote it became clear that Graviton2 is an important component in achieving AWS’ sustainability goals. ARM processors require less power to achieve the same performance as x86 processors. This means less power consumption, but it also has indirect benefits. Less power consumption means less excess heat, which means less cooling, which itself means less power consumption as well. Of course, this too is translated into the lower consumer costs for Graviton2.</p>
<h3>Low-friction cost savings with managed services like RDS</h3>
<p>Migrating from x86 to AArch64 is relatively easy. However, ‘relatively easy’ can still be ‘absolutely difficult’ in large and complex environments. If you want to benefit from Graviton’s improved price/performance over x86 as soon as possible, there might be some low hanging fruit. Amazon is supporting Graviton in more and more of their managed services. They started with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/07/announcing-preview-for-amazon-rds-m6g-and-r6g-instance-types/">RDS</a>, followed by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-elasticache-now-supports-m6g-and-r6g-graviton2-based-instances/">ElastiCache</a> and they just announced support in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-amazon-aurora-r6g-instance-types-powered-by-aws-graviton-2-processors-in-preview/">Aurora</a>. These databases are all reachable over a well-established protocol, and the inputs and outputs between one CPU architecture and another should be no different. This allows you to achieve instant cost savings without any architectural change.</p>
<p>Other services currently supporting Graviton2 processors are EMR, EKS, ECS, CodeBuild and Outposts. Switching architectures with these services will require more effort than the databases, but it’s good to be aware of their support.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I believe Amazon will bring ARM support to every single one of the services where customers select instance types, including Sagemaker, Neptune, Redshift DocumentDB, DMS, MSK, and so on. Additionally, I think they will internally use Graviton to power many services where the underlying hardware is invisible, such as S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, Cognito, Alexa, Route 53 and many others. It’s simply more cost efficient.</p>
<p>For AWS customers ARM support has unlocked a large number of cost savings opportunities. Frankly I can’t think of any reason not to try RDS, ElastiCache or Aurora on Graviton instances. Likewise, you can’t go wrong exploring the cost savings Graviton2 offers on your compute (EC2, ECS, EKS) workloads. The investment for the migration process might be significant, but I think you’ll be surprised by existing compatibility and the long-term savings you might gain. As they say in Dutch: you’re a thief of your own wallet if you don’t.</p>

<p>To be honest, I suffer from a bad case of 'curiosity killed the cat' at times. If I see something I don't understand,
    I find myself researching it to death until I do. It should come then as no surprise that this box of IBM
    strangeness ended up gnawing away on my soul for the better part of a month before I was finally ready to put it to
    bed.</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/back_of_box.jpg" alt="Box Rear">
    </p>
    <p><b>Back of the Box</b></p>
</div>

<p>The name alone is already kinda interesting, and then I saw this closeup of the back which stated that it needs "one
    of the following compilers", and well, all I can say is: 'shut up and take my money'. Even after it arrived though,
    I was still no closer to solving this mystery. The blurb on the front just added more questions than answers.</p>

<blockquote>“[It is] an ANSI-Metafile standard for storage and transfer of professional quality graphics on a
    file-oriented storage service. The Graphical File System provides highly portable graphics information, and
    easy-to-use icon interface to enhance programming productivity.”</blockquote>

<p>I'm fairly sure you find one could find worse explanations, but it would take some effort. That being said, it
    shouldn't
    have taken as nearly long as it did to decode this block of mysteriousness had the included documentation had
    included something like a useful summary. I've really never seen that many pages of manual that technically
    describes something while failing to actually tell you anything useful ...</p>

<p>Even the pages where it describes the Graphical File System itself really don't help ...</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/gfs_full_spread.png" alt="Official Product Description">
    </p>
    <p><b>Graphical File System Summary</b></p>
</div>

<p>The best I could get out of this is it had something to do with saving and loading graphics to file, but the
    documentation was
    remarkable short on details. In a broad sense, the manual could be broken up as follows: "A summary of IBM's
    Professional
    Graphics Series", "The Professional Graphics Series Drivers", and finally "Metafiles: everything you wanted to know,
    but were afraid to ask!".</p>

<p>We'll go into all these points in detail, but let's talk about what I actually found in the box. As usual, my
    findings come in YouTube form in addition to write-up, so do take a look, as does make a huge difference for me.</p>

<p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKcOqOnM-T8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>


<h2>What Was In The Box ...</h2>

<p>Beside the manual, there were five disks, three for the Graphical File System, and two labeled 'Professional Graphics
    Series Device Drivers'.</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/gfs_disks.jpg" alt="Graphical File System Disk">
    </p>
    <p><b>The five included 5.25 inch disks</b></p>
</div>

<p>All five disks were healthy, and my SuperCard Pro was able to read them without issue. The first three disks had what
    you might expect from a piece of development software: test applications, example code, and libraries for Lattice C,
    and IBM's FORTRAN and BASIC compilers.</p>

<p>The only thing that was really of note was METAFILE.EXE, which the manual calls the 'Interactive Interpreter', but it
    also became clear that there was more than meets the eye. The remaining two disks had the VDI subsystem, followed by
    a bunch of SYS files with one of the worst uses of 8.3 filenames that I've seen in awhile.</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/vdi_files.png" alt="VDI Files">
    </p>
    <p><b>Professional Graphics Series Disk 2 Files</b></p>
</div>

<p>The manual also had a fairly long setup section. It appears that the Graphical File System is built around something
    called the Virtual Device Interface. It's here where I really began to fall down the rabbit hole.</p>

<h2>Standardizing Graphics: The Graphical Kernel System</h2>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/iso_standard.png" alt="ISO 7942">
    </p>
    <p><b>Professional Graphics Series Disk 2 Files</b></p>
</div>


<p>To be honest, what I found sorta surprised me. When most people think of early graphics, I tend to think in terms of
    Apple's QuickDraw, Microsoft's GDI, or even Adobe's PostScript. These were the big players, and aside from Apple
    migrating to PDF, all of them have continued to the present day. As far as graphics go, it has always seemed to be a
    world of 'pick your own proprietary standard'. So if you had asked me before if I thought that not only <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</a> but <a href="https://iso.org/">ISO</a> as a whole had actually tried to
    standardize graphics, I'd probably gone with "[citation needed]".
</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wikipedian_protester.png" alt="[citation needed]]">
</p>

<p>To be fair, the GFS manual does actually talk about the Graphical Kernel System, but in such a way that it makes it
    sound like a product, and not an actual specification. As I would find out <i>much</i> later, there is in fact a
    reason for this.</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/ibm_pc_graphical_kernel_system.png" alt="Graphical Kernel System in the GFS Manual">
    </p>
    <p><b>Graphical Kernel System in the GFS Manual</b></p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, the actual standards themselves appear to be paywalled, but I was able to gleam some bits through
    heavy Googling. The GKS system essentially worked as modern vector graphics do today. Instead of simply saving and
    loading a bitmap, drawing commands are stored in a series of commands, and then rendered at runtime. This is
    provided through Virtual Device Interface that I talked about earlier.</p>

<p>Actually, I was rather surprised that this existed not only in 1984, but actually dates back as far
    as the 70s. While vector graphics were an old concept even by the 1980s, I had always assumed that they had
    essentially remained proprietary affairs throughout this period. That also provides a good way of actually showing
    the impact of what something like the GKS and vectorized graphics could actually do.</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/true_type_example.png" alt="TrueType Sizing Example">
    </p>
    <p><b>TrueType Sizing Example</b></p>
</div>

<p>The absolute best example I can give of the importance of vector graphics, and the underlying principles at the heart
    of the Graphical Kernel System is fontfaces. Very early fonts were essentially bitmapped images; you couldn't freely
    resize them, you needed a given font in a given size to use it. This is obviously rather undesirable for multiple
    reasons. Adobe created Type 1 fonts, and Apple created TrueType in an attempt to defeat this by defining fonts as a
    series of drawing commands instead of static images. This leads to the ability to freely change and modify font
    sizes on the fly.</p>

<p>With the Graphical Kernel System (and vector systems in general), images could essentially be dynamically shaped and
    modified for their surroundings. Want to dynamically resize a chart? Go for it. Need to zoom in to add more detail?
    Not an issue! In short, in a vector system, you have all the information to create and change an image at any
    resolution. This means that you can transfer images across devices and printers without risk of loosing information.
</p>

<p>That brings us to the Virtual Device Metafile format or VDM. Metafiles are essentially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serialization</a> method for storing VDI commands to disk.
    Interestingly, the Metafile format does appear to have survived to the present day as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Graphics_Metafile">Computer Graphics Metafile</a> format, although
    it doesn't appear to be binary compatible with the older VDM format. That being said, we now can understand what the
    blurb on the front of the box is all about - The Graphical File System is a way to store and load metafiles. Seems
    straightforward enough, and neat enough to check out. Let's get installing.</p>

<h2>From A to Lattice C and All The Pain In-Between</h2>
<p>Given the time period, for installation, I went with an emulated PC AT, PC-DOS 3.3, and an EGA card. EGA support
    seems to be a last minute addition, since the box doesn't menton it. That's not entirely surprising because the EGA
    card was publicly released late 1984, so it would have just been coming on the market as the Graphical File System
    was released. Both the manual and driver disks do directly reference EGA support however.

    </p>
    <p><b>Copying Disks Over</b></p>
</div>

<p>In addition, since I expected to do some programming, I felt a good text editor was in order. PC-DOS 3.3 only ships
    with EDLIN, and I wanted something just a <i>tad</i> less bare bones. So, for this project, I installed Borland
    Brief, and got to it. Brief is a pretty decent editor, and while I never used it back in the day, it seemed pretty
    easy to pick up and run with. After getting it installed it was just a bit more effort to get CONFIG.SYS sorted.

    </p>
    <p><b>CONFIG.SYS Edited for VDI Drivers</b></p>
</div>

<p>With the bare essentials taken care of, it was time to dig in a bit deeper. According to the manual, the GRID binary
    displays a reference image. Sure enough, it rendered on the first try. I didn't notice it until comparing it to the
    other graphics modes, but this isn't actually rendering correctly. Specifically, the image is not sitting in the
    correct location on screen, and its cut off. The CGA drivers in contrast appear to render the test graphic better,
    albeit with lower color fidelity.</p>

    <p><img src="https://casadevall.pro/images/articles/2020/graphical_file_system/grid_reference.png" alt="GRID in 16-color EGA">

    </p>
    <p><b>GRID rendered in 4 color CGA 320x200 Mode</b></p>
</div>

<p>I did try the other graphics modes, and as I mentioned in the video, the EGA monochrome one simply crashed.
    Meanwhile, the PCjr just went and said No. To be honest, the fact that there is even a jr driver seems weird because
    the basic VDI driver set occupies about 300 kilobytes of conventional memory. While it is possible to expand a jr
    that far, the cost combined with the jr's iffy reputation for software compatibility made me wonder who would even
    try it?</p>

</div>

<p>Well, besides me. But I'm doing it in the interest of historical preservation. That's my justification and I'm
    sticking with it.</p>

<p>I didn't actually notice the resolution cutoff at the time, and it was only when going back to demonstrate CGA
    capabilities did I even realize that the image was cutoff. Once again, I don't know if this is a problem with PCem,
    or a problem with VDI since I don't have the physical card to test it. It is possible that since this was almost
    certainly developed on a pre-production EGA card (since the GFS product was released a few months before EGA cards
    hit the market), its doing something wrong. It won't be the first known example of IBM-branded software having
    incompatibles with still-to-be-released equipment (see …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Blurring is an important operation in video post-production. Instead of using costly software, you can use FFmpeg’s <code>boxblur</code> to blur your videos and even choose which area of the frames to blur. </strong></p>



<p><strong>In this post, let’s learn how to use FFmpeg’s <code>boxblur</code> function to blur a section of a video or a part of a frame. </strong></p>



<h2><strong>Anatomy of FFmpeg’s boxblur function&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Before providing the full command, let’s get familiar with the baseline <code>filter-complex</code> function.</p>



<pre><code>"[0:v]crop=400:400:300:350,boxblur=10[fg]; [0:v][fg]overlay=300:350[v]"</code></pre>



<p>There are 2 sets of coordinates mentioned here-</p>



<ul><li><code>crop=400:400:300:350</code> : This denotes a <code>400x400</code> pixel box located <code>300</code> pixels to the right and <code>350</code> pixels to the bottom from the top left corner</li><li><code>overlay=300:350</code> : This determines the pixels to overlay inside the box. Unless required otherwise, use the same last two coordinates mentioned in the <code>crop</code> to ensure the blurred effect is applied on the pixels that are located where the box is.&nbsp;</li><li>the <code>10</code> indicates the power of the blurring effect or its intensity. You can set it individually for the luma, chroma, and alpha planes and also set the blurring power. If you don’t provide the radius or the blurring power, it defaults to <code>2</code>. </li></ul>



<p>With that, let’s take a look at the command to take a video input and blur a portion of it across its entire playback.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0:v]crop=200:400:300:350,boxblur=10[fg]; [0:v][fg]overlay=300:350[v]" \
-map "[v]"  \
blurredVideo.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here is what the output looks like. We have a <code>200x400</code> block of pixels blurred out.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=698%2C393&amp;ssl=1" alt="boxblur blur a video using ffmpeg" width="698" height="393" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?w=1192&amp;ssl=1 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20698%20393'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?w=1192&amp;ssl=1 1192w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-31.png?resize=698%2C393&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Next, let’s take a look at how to change the blurring power and what the output looks like. </p>



<h3>FFmpeg’s boxblur with power = 10 </h3>











<h3>FFmpeg’s boxblur with power = 30</h3>



<p>Now let’s look at a blurring power = <code>30</code> to show how you can change the blurring effect using <code>boxblur</code>.</p>







<p>It’s as simple as that. But that’s not all. There are a lot of fancy tricks and techniques we can use to make much more of the “boxblur”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How to Blur all but a Specific Area of the Video</strong> using Boxblur</h2>



<p>Let’s find out how to do the opposite of what we’ve just done, and blur everything that is not in the cropped box. Just like above, <code>crop</code> and <code>overlay</code> are used exactly in the same manner.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0:v]boxblur=10[bg];[0:v]crop=600:600:100:500[fg];[bg][fg]overlay=100:500" \
-map 0:v \
blurredVideo.mp4</code></pre>















<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we learned to use FFmpeg’s <code>boxblur</code> function to selectively blur a portion of the video. Hope this was helpful and do check out the <a href="https://ottverse.com/category/ffmpeg/">rest of OTTVerse’s FFmpeg tutorials</a>.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Me and my family uploads most of our photos on Google Photos. This always bothered me since this is one of the most important data we have and we are relying on the promise of unlimited storage by Google. Even then we are losing the original quality photos and uploading lossy photos (what google calls High Quality Photos) to get the unlimited storage. I always wanted to find a good alternative for this. I investigated several alternatives for taking backup of photos from our mobiles. Although there are several cloud services which does this, I didn't want to rely on another cloud service and wanted to self host this. I finally settled on <code>Syncthing</code> for myself.</p>
<p>I run Syncthing on one of my Raspberry Pi 4 and also run it on my mobile. It syncs all my photos from my mobile to the Raspberry Pi which kind of acts like a NAS. This works well for me but I can't do this for all my family member who are not tech savvy. So I wanted a simpler solution which can be used by anyone. Enter <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>. I ran it on my Raspberry Pi NAS and it ran well. I tested it with their mobile app and found that this is pretty good for our use case. I was worried that this isn't a reliable setup since it's running on a Pi at my home which has a flaky internet setup. I wanted to move this to a more reliable setup but since I was always lazy, I never did.</p>
<p>Recently google announced that there is <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes">no more unlimited storage</a> in Google Photos. This motivated me to setup a more reliable Nextcloud.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-nextcloud">Setting up Nextcloud</h3>
<p>There are several ways to setup Nextcloud. One setup I thought would be the best way to setup a S3 compatible object storage as the primary storage for Nextcloud on a VPS. So I have setup a Digitalocean droplet with Backblaze B2 but the problem is that the it was rather slow as the primary storage when there are lot of objects in a folder. Also I got some errors while uploading a large number of files.</p>
<p>I have investigated and found that the probably the most cost effective, reliable and performant way is to get a VPS with a reliable provider and use their Block storage for primary storage. I have settled on Hetzner's cloud VPS solution since this is the cheapest and they have a good reputation.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-hetzner-vps">Setting up Hetzner VPS</h4>
<p>I used Ansible to setup the VPS. Since there is no Cloud Firewall provided by Hetzner, we need to setup our firewall using <code>ufw</code>. </p>
<p>We need to allow these ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>80</code> (http)</li>
<li><code>443</code> (https)</li>
<li><code>22</code> (ssh)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to use Docker for setting up Nextcloud. One thing to keep in mind is that any forwarded ports will disobey <code>ufw</code> rules. This is a <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/777">known issue</a> and there seems to be no official resolution close by. So we are only forwarding <code>80</code> &amp; <code>443</code> and since these ports are anyways open, we are okay in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Volume of 100 GB is attached to the server while creating the VPS. We are going to use ZFS for this volume for it's compression and snapshotting capabilities.</p>
<p>A pool needs to be created with this volume. Let's call this <code>tank</code>.</p>
<pre><span>$</span><span> zpool create tank /dev/disk/by-id/idofthedisk
</span></pre>
<p>Here instead of using something like <code>/dev/sdb</code> we using the id of the disk so that even if the disk's name changes we should be fine. You can find the id of the disk by using <code>ls -lah /dev/disk/by-id/</code>.</p>
<p>We will create a dataset for our Nextcloud.</p>
<pre><span>$</span><span> zfs create</span><span> -o</span><span> compression=lz4 mountpoint=/data/nextcloud tank/nextcloud
</span></pre>
<p>This should create a dataset called <code>tank/nextcloud</code> with <code>lz4</code> compression and then mount it at <code>/data/nextcloud</code>. This will be where all our Nextcloud data will live.</p>
<p>For managing the containers, <code>docker-compose</code> can be used. Here is the file I used for running Nextcloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Replace all the variables in <code>{{ }}</code> with the correct values.</p>

<p>Here Caddy is used as the reverse proxy to Nextcloud so that TLS certificates are managed automatically. This should make your nextcloud available at <code>{{ nextcloud_domain }}</code>.</p>
<h3 id="backing-up">Backing up</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> as my backup solution. I have a daily cron which takes backup of this to Backblaze B2.</p>
<h3 id="expanding-storage">Expanding storage</h3>
<p>Since this is a volume, I can always resize my volume to a larger size. I need to take my machine offline and then expand the ZFS pool once I have resized the volume. </p>
<p>Another way is to add a new volume and then add that volume to the pool. There is no need to take the machine offline in this case. One thing to note here: the data isn't rebalanced between the volumes automatically, but the new data is written to the new volume until both the volumes are same in size.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Nextcloud is a good alternative to all the proprietary clouds. It has a lot of quirks sure but this is being improved constantly. It isn't really not a real alternative to something like Google Photos which not only backs up the photos automatically but magically tags the photos with people &amp; items in the photos (and other crazy ML shit Google does), but for backing up, Nextcloud <strong>is</strong> a good alternative.</p>
<p>I plan to explore <a href="https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism">Photoprism</a> as an alternative to Google Photos for their ML magic.</p>

We still have to think very carefully when writing queries and designing how we store and process data. It is an iterative process and when data or concurrency increase, some queries have to be rewritten to maintain performance.</p> <h2 id="monitoring-api-response-times">Monitoring API response times</h2> <p>Our enterprise tier includes performance (QPS and latency) SLAs that our platform needs to satisfy. We provide a platform where our customers can store, process and <a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/using-dynamic-parameters-for-changing-aggregation-types-on-the-fly">define dynamic API endpoints</a> to query their data.</p> <p>As users can define arbitrary endpoints, some of them could end up being too computationally expensive and slow. That would have an impact on performance, so to meet the SLAs we sometimes also help our enterprise customers optimize their data schemas and their queries.</p> <p>Monitoring the requests made to those endpoints and their duration is fundamental to know how well the system is performing and whether more work has to be done to meet performance requirements.</p> <p>This log data is available for all Tinybird accounts via the <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/api-reference/service-datasources.html#tinybird-pipe-stats-rt">tinybird.pipe_stats_rt</a> service data source, for the past two days.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/2020-12-15/pipe_stats_rt.png" alt="The tinybird.pipe_stats_rt Data Source provides request time, endpoints called, full URLs, response durations and error codes, if any"> <figcaption>The tinybird.pipe_stats_rt Data Source provides request time, endpoints called, full URLs, response durations and error codes, if any</figcaption> </figure> <p>But even if you don’t use Tinybird, if you have requests logs for your app’s endpoints, you could do a similar analysis to the one we explain below.</p> <h2 id="correlating-presence-or-absence-of-query-parameters-with-response-times">Correlating presence or absence of query parameters with response times</h2> <p>The goal here is detecting what parameters have a bigger impact on query complexity when they’re present in the request URLs, and then modifying those queries or the underlying schemas to keep response times low.</p> <p>For any given endpoint, if response times are higher when a certain parameter appears in the request URL, and they’re lower when it doesn’t appear, the correlation between response times and whether that parameter was included in the URL will be high.</p> <p>Computing whether and which parameters appear in each request URL can be done with some of the <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions/">string search functions</a> that ClickHouse provides us with. To calculate whether the endpoint URL contains the word <code>country</code>, we’d add a column like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>position</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>'country'</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>h_country</span><span>,</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>We could also perform the previous step using <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/url-functions/#extracturlparameterurl-name">extractURLParameter</a>, another ClickHouse function.</p> <p>To add a column that counts the number of elements of a comma-separated-values parameter, we’d do:</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>length</span><span>(</span><span>splitByChar</span><span>(</span><span>','</span><span>,</span> <span>coalesce</span><span>(</span><span>extractURLParameter</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>'country'</span><span>),</span> <span>''</span><span>)))</span> <span>n_country</span><span>,</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>And finally, the last step is getting the correlation between whether a query string is present in the endpoint and the duration of the requests made to that endpoint. The higher the correlation, the longer the calls to that endpoint take when that parameter is present, and the more work will likely have to be done to bring request durations down.</p> <p>We can also compute correlation within Tinybird and ClickHouse, with the <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/corr/">corr</a> function</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/2020-12-15/corr_node.png" alt="Correlating all the variables we've created with response duration"> <figcaption>Correlating all the variables we've created with response duration</figcaption> </figure> <p>Some elements of the correlation matrix will probably be null (because a parameter was never present in an endpoint), so we’ll replace those null values with 0. ClickHouse lets us do it with the <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/conditional-functions/#ternary-operator">ternary operator</a></p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/2020-12-15/fillna_corr.png" alt="Replacing null values with 0"> <figcaption>Replacing null values with 0</figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="visualizing-the-correlation-matrix-in-google-sheets">Visualizing the correlation matrix in Google Sheets</h2> <p>Tinybird allows you to expose the results of a pipe with a JSON or CSV API endpoint. Clicking on the <strong>View API</strong> button in the top right corner you’ll see a self-documenting page for the endpoint exposed:</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/2020-12-15/api_docs.png" alt="API endpoint documentation page within Tinybird"> <figcaption>API endpoint documentation page within Tinybird</figcaption> </figure> <p>And with the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093335?hl=en">IMPORTDATA</a> function available in Google Sheets, we can import the results into a spreadsheet, where we can visualize them much better:</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/2020-12-15/corr_matrix.png" alt="Visualizing the correlation matrix in Google Sheets"> <figcaption>Visualizing the correlation matrix in Google Sheets</figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="what-did-we-do-to-fix-it">What did we do to fix it?</h2> <p>For example, in this case we’d see that the endpoints 0, 1 and 14 tend to be slower with non-aggregated data (<code>h_non_aggr</code>). To fix it, we <strong>partitioned the table and set a good sorting key</strong> so that it does not have to do a full scan every time.</p> <p>Also, the bigger the range of dates we’re reading data from (<code>n_day</code>), the slower endpoints 8, 12 and 22 are. To deal with bigger date ranges, the way to go would be <strong>merging data from materialized views with different temporal aggregations</strong>, depending on the date range of the current query.</p> <p>We also noticed that endpoints filtered by country (<code>h_country</code>, <code>h_country2</code>) tend to be faster (except endpoint 2, due to an expensive array filtering). So we <strong>reduced the amount of threads needed for those queries</strong> so that other queries had more threads available.</p> <p>More things: we saw that <code>h_raw_filter</code> impacts performance on most of the endpoints. This is due to an expensive IN filter to a big dimensions Data Source. We did nothing because it would have complicated the logic of other endpoints, but it’s a place where to improve for the future.</p> <p>And finally: the bigger <code>h_page_size</code> is, the slower the queries are. There is nothing to do here. The developers that integrate the endpoints should take it into account, and therefore request <strong>smaller page sizes</strong> and <strong>implement infinite scrolling</strong> or similar.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/2020-12-15/old_vs_new_endpoint_times.png" alt="After making these changes, response times went down ~40%"> <figcaption>After making these changes, response times went down ~40%</figcaption> </figure> <p>That’s it!

      <h3>What does a Honey Bee see?</h3>
      <p>Like most other insects, the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) has compound eyes - hundreds of single eyes (called ommatidia) arranged next to each other, each with its own lens and each looking in a different direction. This does not mean, however, that the bee sees lots of little pictures, as each ommatidium sees only one intensity, contributing a 'pixel' to the overall image perceived by the compound eye, just like a single photoreceptor in the retina of our own eye.</p>
      <p>But there are differences between the bee's view of the world and ours. The bee has a lot fewer ommatidia than we have photoreceptors, and they are not evenly spaced. And of course the bee sees colours differently, relies more on image motion than on shapes, and much more.</p>
      <p>B-EYE ignores most of these differences, simulating just the optics of the honey bee's compound eyes. It shows what a bee would see of a flat image, with the bee facing straight at the plane of the image. The original image (24x24cm in the bee's world) is on the left, and the representation of what the bee would see is on the right.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/">AWS CloudShell</a> is a CLI embedded in the AWS Web Console. It is meant to make it
easier to run the AWS CLI, SDK and other scripts from your web browser, without having to install anything locally or
having to deal with local credential and profiles management. <strong>It is a free service</strong>.</p>
<p>It is interesting that you can persist data on your <code>$HOME</code> (up to 1GB!). And this presented an obvious opportunity to
run our favorite database, Postgres, on this environment. Because we all know that
<a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/route-53-amazons-premier-database/">everything is a database</a>. AWS CloudShell, too.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to claim your free 1GB Postgres database, per AWS account, per region, you just need to run the following
commands and wait a few seconds/minutes</strong>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">curl -s https://ongres.com/install_postgres_aws_cloudshell.bash | bash
<span>source</span> .bashrc
psql
</code></pre></div><p>(yes, yes, it is a bad practice to run shell scripts from the Internet; please go ahead and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-postgres_on_aws_cloudshell/install_postgres_aws_cloudshell.bash">inspect the short source code</a>
before running it; validate that its <code>sha256sum</code> is <code>102eae7190ba7a4d148d44a62f29c10cfe9d77ffa34eb66438ce5e06941bf6c4</code>;
you get the point)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ongres.com/img/blog/postgres_on_aws_cloudshell.png" alt="Postgres running on AWS CloudShell"></p>
<h3 id="what">What???</h3>
<p>Yes, you read it well. You can run, for free, a Postgres database on AWS CloudShell, with 1GB (almost) of storage. One
instance per region (where CloudShell is available) per AWS account. There are a few caveats, derived from the
environment, but this is an otherwise unrestricted, non-managed Postgres database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The instance is not permanently running. Only when you enter the CloudShell from your web browser. Buy hey, <strong>this is
almost like Aurora Serverless</strong>! (well, almost…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t possibly connect to it from the outside. Only locally, and it is configured with this assumption in mind.
But still, you can even use it as your <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/pg.html">Terraform state storage</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no replicas (no failover) nor backups. Thought both could be added…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>The CloudShell environment is a bit restricted, so you cannot just <code>yum install postgresql</code>. In particular, only your
<code>$HOME</code> folder is persistent. This means that no packages can be installed from <code>yum</code> (they may be wiped out).
Postgres will be installed in your home directory: both binaries –in <code>postgres-13</code> folder– and data –in <code>pgdata</code>
folder–. We can neither assume the presence of any external library that Postgres may call/link to, as those would
also not exist if installed via the package manager –we could install them into our <code>$HOME</code> too, but that seemed excessive.</p>
<p>The script needs to be run only once, for the installation. It downloads Postgres source code, configure it with some
appropriate options to keep everything local and not require any additional shared libraries not present in the base
image, compile and installs it locally. Note that some packages are installed via <code>yum</code> (and those will be lost) but are
only needed for compilation, not for running Postgres.</p>
<p>Then the Postgres binaries (including the command line client, <code>psql</code>) and the command to start the database are added
to your <code>.bashrc</code>. So anytime you open CloudShell, your database will be available already for you. Just type <code>psql</code>.</p>
<p>However, what happens when the CloudShell is passivated? Postgres is then abruptly killed. Good news is that Postgres is
a <strong>durable</strong> database, and is designed to survive to these situations. Upon restart, Postgres will find that it wasn’t
shutdown cleanly, and will start recovery. Unless you were doing heavy write load, this recovery process will be quite
fast. If you check the logs, they will be similar to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">2020-12-17 08:45:32.894 GMT <span>[</span>59<span>]</span> LOG:  starting PostgreSQL 13.1 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> 7.3.1 <span>20180712</span> <span>(</span>Red Hat 7.3.1-11<span>)</span>, 64-bit

2020-12-17 08:45:33.037 GMT <span>[</span>59<span>]</span> LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
</code></pre></div><p>Also, a slightly optimized configuration for this environment is installed by the script. The most notable tuned parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>max_connections There are two cores on CloudShell, and they appear to be heavily throttled. Plus we’re not serving
really network traffic. Better to keep the value low. Also the configuration includes limiting the processes
parallelism, taking into account the only two cores available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage. If you do bulk loadings, you may end up generating a fair amount of WAL, that decreases the effective storage
you may have for your data. So min_wal_size has been set to its minimum possible value in this scenario and
max_wal_size just to 64MB (4 wile segments) to leave some room. If you want to maximize your data storage space you
may have both parameters set to 32MB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory parameters. There are 4GB of RAM (nice!), so we can bump up a little bit shared_buffers, work_mem,
maintenance_work_mem and effective_cache_size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crash recovery. This is very important, since our favorite database will be shutdown abruptly many times. The first
measure is to make frequent checkpoints (by reducing checkpoint_timeout to the minimum value) while increasing the
activity of the background writer, and disabling the “frequent checkpoint warning” –checkpoints they will now be
intentionally frequent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No replicas. Finally we restrict some parameters and minimize wal production knowing that (at least for this post’s
shake) there will be no replicas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete configuration applied to Postgres on CloudShell is the following:</p>

  




<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>This could be taken further. It could be possible to add <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g">WAL-g</a> and make continuous
database backups to S3. Then, by using S3 Cross-Region Replication, that backups and WAL files could be transferred to
another region. And then restore them on another Postgres running on CloudShell and have a read-only replica.</p>
<p>Imagination is the only limit. What’s next, what’s your take?</p>

The Finnish act of taking a sauna bath is heading to Unescoâ€™s list of intangible human heritage. This elevates the sauna tradition on the global scale to the categories of, say, Indian yoga, Beijing Opera, Argentinian tango, Turkish coffee ceremony ja Iranian rug making.</span></p><p><span>One of the main protagonists of this project, Ms. </span><a href="https://www.hs.fi/haku/?query=Ritva%20Ohmeroluoma">Ritva Ohmeroluoma</a><span> from The Finnish Sauna Society, feels relieved. â€�It took four yearsâ€™ of work to bring the resultâ€�, she says. â€�When we embarked on this a long time ago, we had no idea how long and arduous this process would be.â€�</span></p><p><span>Ms. Ohmeroluoma gives the telephone interview in the middle on something right and proper for the subject. She sits by the sea in Lauttasaari suburb of Helsinki, waiting for the Sauna Societyâ€™s famous saunas to warm up.</span></p><p><span>Finland</span><span> signed Unescoâ€™s Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2013. The preparations for making it to the list were started a couple of years later.</span></p><p><span>There were, however, many bureaucratic snags on the road. At first The Finnish Heritage Agency had to create a national catalogue of living heritage. Thus far approximately 60 Finnish traditions have been chosen. In addition to sauna bathing the catalogue includes Finnish tango, open-air dance and the knitting of rag rugs.</span></p><p><span>From this catalogue Finland can propose one item each year.</span></p><p><span>Sauna bathing was the first one.</span></p><div><div><p>Ms. Ritva Ohmeroluoma was photographed cooling off on the outdoor terrace of the Finnish Sauna Association in Lauttasaari, Helsinki.<span>Â­</span><span>Kuva:Â&nbsp;<!-- -->Mika Ranta / HS</span></p></div></div><p><span>It was</span><span> not hard to find arguments to convince the committee of 24 country representatives. The traditions of sauna bathing are repeated over and again in Finnish songs, mythology and storytelling tradition.</span></p><p><span>People were born in sauna, they have thrashed out their lives in sauna and they have washed their dearest for their last rites in sauna.</span></p><p><span>And the tradition lives very strong even nowadays: almost 90 per cent of the Finns go to sauna once a week and there are approximately 3,2 million saunas in the country.</span></p><p><span>No wonder, then, that the prestigious committee of Unesco was impressed.</span></p><p><span>In spite</span><span> of that, it was not easy to formulate the 25-page application. It was decided to give this task to the Finnish Sauna Society.</span></p><p><span>After this decision had been taken, the Ministry of Education and Culture granted financial aid for the Society to be able to recruit one person to complete the application. It became the common cause for sauna associations in various parts of the country. The draft was commented by sauna enthusiasts in Oulu, Tampere and Lappeenranta, among others.</span></p><p><span>One of the tricky questions haunting the writers of the application was how to differentiate the Finnish sauna from the Central European warmth chambers.</span></p><p><span>The solution was the sound of water thrown on the hot stones in any Finnish sauna. This sound was repeated on the video sent to Unesco.</span></p><p><span>Nudity was another challenge. The Finnish Heritage Agency gathered an international test group and read its members the first draft compiled by the Sauna Society. The result was crystal clear: it was not a worthwhile idea to use the word naked at all in the final application text.</span></p><p><span>â€�Nudity in the sauna is, of course, natural for the Finns. Internationally, itâ€™s a different storyâ€�, Ms. Ohmeroluoma says.</span></p><p><span>â€�So we wrote that the Finns go to sauna without clothing.â€�</span></p><p><span>Naked </span><span>skin was censured heavily also from the photos added to the application. One cannot see breasts or buttocks neither in the photos nor in the video, not to mention genitals. Naked children are nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p><span>Ms Ohmeroluoma believes that without assistance the heritage list would have remained a pipe dream.</span></p><p><span>â€�The help was irreplaceable. We were not able to consider all the nuances and without outside help the application would certainly have been turned down.â€�</span></p><p><span>The preparation</span><span> of the application took ten months, and in the last days work lasted late into the night. Still in the final stages one photo deemed too daring was replaced with one Ms. Ohmeroluoma digged from her cellphone.</span></p><p><span>It is a picture of her own favorite sauna: the home beach sauna on the shores of Lake Saimaa.</span></p><p><span>The Finnish sauna is not the first sauna-connected item on the Unesco heritage list. Estonia gained the recognition for the smoke sauna tradition of VÃµrumaa already in 2013. At that time somewhat bitter comments like â€�stealing the saunaâ€� were heard in Finland.</span></p><p><span>Senior Specialist </span><a href="https://www.hs.fi/haku/?query=Leena%20Marsio">Leena Marsio</a><span> from the Finnish Heritage Agency thinks that the success of the neighbor does not hurt Finland. â€�This list is different from Unescoâ€™s World Heritage List. Intangible list makes peopleâ€™s, communitiesâ€™ or groupsâ€™ different cultural heritage visible. The list can include, say, many different puppet theatres. Also these different sauna bathing traditions differ from each other in a fine way. The Estonians have listed the smoke sauna tradition of one region, we have the whole sauna bathing cultureâ€�, she says.</span></p><p><span>â€�People go to saunas elsewhere in the world, as well, but based on numbers, no other nation can rival the Finnish sauna madness. People here eat, sleep and go to saunas.â€�</span></p><p><span>Before the latest decisions Unesco had listed 549 intangible culture heritage items from 127 countries. Now there are about 50 listed items more.</span></p><p><span>Ms. Marsio </span><span>has been involved with the Finnish sauna application from the start. Now sheâ€™s going to put her energy to the next Finnish heritage items to be offered to the list.</span></p><p><span>The first deals with the violin playing tradition from Kaustinen and Finland is also participating in the application concerning the Nordic clinker-built boat. The decisions are expected in one year.</span></p><p><span>Before that itâ€™s time to reap the benefits from the fresh accomplishment. As part of the application the sauna community had defined a whole host of protective measures to support the vitality of sauna traditions.</span></p><p><span>To support these measures, a special organization called Saunarinki was formed. It is an open network for everybody active on this field. The Finnish Heritage Agency has granted the Finnish Sauna Society financial assistance to start the operations.</span></p><p><span>â€�The purpose is to use this network to consider, how the sauna heritage can be promoted. It can mean organizing events and information activitiesâ€�, Ms. Marsio thinks.</span></p><p><span>The Finnish Heritage Agency is also preparing the protection of three public saunas based on special law. These are Kotiharju sauna and Arla sauna in Helsinki and Rajaportti sauna in Tampere.</span></p><p><span>Thought is also given to utilizing the Unesco recognition in marketing. â€�There will undoubtedly be tourism-related benefits. Sauna and lÃ¶yly (throwing water on hot stones) are the only Finnish words known the world over and this strengthens our reputation as the land of saunaâ€�, Ms. Marsio says.</span></p><p><span>Ms. Ohmeroluoma</span><span> from the Sauna Society has plans to celebrate the success of the project in a natural way: by going to sauna. She tells how her own sauna journey got under way in public saunas in the city of Mikkeli in early 1950s.</span></p><p><span>â€�Pretty quickly it became a ritual for me and that ritual has continued for the rest of my lifeâ€�, she says.</span></p><p><span>Memories of childhood sauna visits in the village of Lievestuore have stayed vivid in her mind.

<p>Three years ago, I asked Kun Gao, a co-founder and former CEO of anime site Crunchyroll, whether he thought the medium on which his company relied would ever go mainstream. We were sitting in what were then Crunchyroll’s headquarters on the seventh floor of the sprawling Westfield Mall building in San Francisco — a space once occupied by Microsoft. He smiled. “It’s still niche,” he said. “But it’s a pretty big niche.”</p>



<p>Last week, Sony took a big bite into that niche by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec7f2580-8098-44cf-aa47-626613ab64de">purchasing Crunchyroll</a> from American telecoms giant AT&amp;T’s WarnerMedia for a cool $1.2 billion. The deal puts the company Gao co-founded 14 years ago with five other computer engineering grads (and self-professed “nerds”) from the University of California, Berkeley, at the very center of Sony’s push to become a direct-to-consumer player, joining the fray with behemoths Netflix, Amazon, and Disney. Entertainment, and anime in particular, will be its cornerstone.</p>



<p>To industry observers, Sony’s purchase, while likely overpriced according to some, is hardly surprising. Over the past five years, the company has been on an international anime buying-spree, acquiring distributor-streamers Wakanim (France), Madman Anime (Australia and New Zealand), Manga Entertainment (U.K.), and Funimation (U.S.), the last of which was Crunchyroll’s only direct competitor in the States (the two forged a 2016 partnership before Sony swallowed both) and a comparative steal at only $150 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, one of the surprises of the Crunchyroll deal is that it has taken Sony so long to invest heavily in a lucrative entertainment business in its own backyard. Eighty-seven percent of Japan’s anime studios are in Tokyo, most of them a short train ride across town from Sony’s world headquarters. Yet the company’s anime ventures until now have been timid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 1995, Sony Music Entertainment Japan established its own anime-management subsidiary, Aniplex, which, 10 years later, spawned the anime studio A-1 Pictures. While amply funded, A-1 has so far seen only limited success, primarily with its series “Sword Art Online.”</p>



<p>Japanese companies rarely appreciate the appeal of Japanese culture. Even the mighty Pokémon franchise was sold for a fraction of its eventual worth <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB934753154504300864">when it was first licensed through a contract that handed all subsidiary rights to its U.S. distributor</a>. A “Galapagos syndrome” mentality, in which Japanese products tend to be developed in isolation, and either fail in international markets, or are never taken overseas, combined with the country’s notoriously risk-averse business culture can make foreign markets seem both alien and daunting.</p>



<p>With Crunchyroll in its grip and a newly branded in-house umbrella company, a joint venture between Funimation and Aniplex called Funimation Group, Sony is taking a bundled approach to anime’s “big niche.” But the sudden billion-dollar buy also looks a little desperate — a proverbial Hail Mary play late in the game with the clock ticking.</p>



<p>Tokyo-based consultant Larry Mahl, a former executive at both Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Home Entertainment, points out that as 2020 wound down, Sony was the only major media player without a seat at the streaming table. In a roughly one-year span, Disney had launched Disney Plus (and now owns Hulu), Warner HBO Max, Apple its Apple TV+ product, and NBCUniversal the Peacock platform. ViacomCBS announced in September that it would stream all of its content on Paramount+ in early 2021.</p>



<p>“In the VOD  era, you need a distribution arm,” says Mahl, “or you’re out of the game.”</p>

<p>The world’s legacy media creators have been falling over themselves in a musical chairs–like scramble to a tune played primarily by Netflix and Amazon Prime — both of which have invested heavily in anime, with Netflix single-handedly transforming the Japanese industry through bidding wars and price bubbles. This October, Netflix entered into four more partnerships with major studios, including veterans Production I.G and Mappa, to raise its <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/en-gb/anime-news/2020/10/26-1/netflix-reveals-upcoming-slate-of-anime-titles-for-2021">total to nine</a>, and it has announced a slate of 16 new anime productions for release next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studios that only a few years ago were paid $150,000 to $300,000 to make an episode for an anime series are now routinely commanding $800,000 to $1 million for the same work.</p>



<p>But Covid-19 caused a spike in demand for online anime content that even the rosiest industry forecasts didn’t predict. The shuttering of live-action sets, combined with a stuck-at-home audience desperate for fantasy escapes, has meant that animation, with its low budget, safe-to-make product and unmasked characters, is now the go-to alternative for both producers and viewers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And not just in Japan. Los Angeles–based animation producer, writer, and consultant Eric Calderon, who oversaw the development of the transcultural joint-venture 2007 anime series “Afro Samurai,” whose main character was voiced by Samuel L. Jackson, says that the number of inquiries he received from U.S. entertainment executives skyrocketed this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People from the live-action world who have never made and know nothing about animation have called me asking about prices,” Calderon says. “The animation medium has been growing in audience acceptance for years, but the pandemic really accelerated interest on the creative side.”</p>



<p>Netflix has reported that the number of households worldwide watching at least one anime title in the year leading up to September 2020 grew by 50% to more than 100 million, and <a href="https://interaksyon.philstar.com/hobbies-interests/2020/10/29/179486/list-of-all-the-anime-series-that-will-drop-on-netflix-soon/">anime products are now among its top 10 titles in almost 100 countries</a>.</p>



<p>For the single-product, anime-dedicated Crunchyroll, it took 10 years to hit the one-million-subscriber mark, in 2016, and two more to hit two million. But in 2020, Crunchyroll surpassed 3.5 million before the year was half over. Today, the company boasts nearly 90 million users and more than 800 employees based in Los Angeles, Tokyo, Paris, Lausanne, Chisinau and Berlin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have experienced a noticeable uptick in users and engagement throughout the pandemic,” says Joellen Ferrer, Crunchyroll’s vice president of communications. “We’re fortunate to be in this business this year.”</p>



<p>Before Covid-19 gave it a boost, anime hadn’t exactly struggled for attention as a global IP. Japanese media titles today account for 11 of the 25 <a href="https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/money-finance/the-25-highest-grossing-media-franchises-of-all-time/">highest-grossing media franchises in the world</a>, a list that includes “Star Wars” and “James Bond,” with “Pokémon” and “Hello Kitty” in the top two slots. Those Japanese titles are the only ones from a non-English-speaking country on the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may have been another surprise hit that pushed Sony into buying Crunchyroll and finally embracing its homegrown medium of anime: “Demon Slayer” (<em>Kimetsu no Yaiba</em>). The anime feature film, co-produced by Sony’s Aniplex arm, manga publisher Shueisha, and anime studio Ufotable, opened in October in Japanese cinemas to a record $44 million, making it the biggest theatrical release in the world that weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, “Demon Slayer” had grossed more than $310 million worldwide. It is on its way to becoming the highest-grossing film ever in Japan, surpassing <em>Titanic</em> and the Academy Award–winning Hayao Miyazaki classic <em>Spirited Away</em>. It is also 2020’s highest-grossing film, something Sony can’t ignore.</p>



<p>Netflix’s chief producer of anime, Taiki Sakurai, a former creator of scripts for veteran studio Production I.G, tells me he welcomes the competition from Crunchyroll. No one should dominate the market, he says, and having more players involved, and thus more creative and financial opportunities, will help the industry grow. Covid-19 will continue to drive demand for subscription video on demand shows.</p>



<p>“Anime’s like sushi,” Sakurai said. “When I was a Japanese kid growing up in the U.K. 40 years ago, there were no sushi restaurants, and everyone thought it was gross: <em>raw fish on fermented rice?</em> But now, you can buy sushi everywhere. It may not be authentically Japanese, but who cares? It’s still sushi, and anime will always be anime.”</p>

<p>Not everyone understands how open source is made. I received the following email from NASA a while ago.</p>



<h2>Subject: Curl Country of Origin and NDAA Compliance</h2>



<blockquote><p>Hello, my name is [deleted] and I am a Supply Chain Risk Management Analyst at NASA. As such, I ensure that all NASA acquisitions of Covered Articles comply with Section 208 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law 116-94, enacted December 20, 2019. To do so, the Country of Origin (CoO) information must be obtained from the company that develops, produces, manufactures, or assembles the product(s). To do so, please provide an email response or a formal document (a PDF on company letterhead is preferred, but a simple statement is sufficient) specifically identifying the country, or countries, in which Curl <strong>is developed and maintained</strong></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If the country of origin is outside the United States, please provide any information you may have stating that testing is performed in the United States prior to supplying products to customers. Additionally, if available, please identify all authorized resellers of the product in question.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Lastly, please confirm that Curl <strong>is not developed by, contain components developed by</strong>, or receive substantial influence from entities prohibited by Section 889 of the 2019 NDAA. These entities include the following companies and any of their subsidiaries or affiliates:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Hytera Communications Corporation<br>Huawei Technologies Company<br>ZTE Corporation<br>Dahua Technology Company<br>Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company</p><p>Finally, we have a time frame of 5 days for a response.<br>Thank you,</p></blockquote>



<h2>My answer</h2>



<p>Okay, I first considered going with strong sarcasm in my reply due to the complete lack of understanding, and the implied threat in that last line. What would happen if I wouldn’t respond in time?</p>



<p>Then it struck me that this could be my chance to once and for all get a confirmation if curl is already actually used in space or not. So I went with informative and a friendly tone.</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi [name],</p><p>I will answer to these questions below to the best of my ability, and maybe you can answer something for me?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>curl (https://curl.se) is an open source project that creates two products, curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. I am the founder, lead developer and core maintainer of the project. To this date, I have done about 57% of the 26,000 changes in the source code repository. The remaining 43% have been done by 841 different volunteers and contributors from all over the world. Their names can be extracted from our git repository: https://github.com/curl/curl</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You can also see that I own most, but not all, copyrights in the project.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am a citizen of Sweden and I’ve been a citizen of Sweden during the entire time I’ve done all and any work on curl. The remaining 841 co-authors are from all over the world, but primarily from western European countries and the US. You could probably say that we live primarily “on the Internet” and not in any particular country.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have resellers. I work for an American company (wolfSSL) where we do curl support for customers world-wide.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Our testing is done universally and is not bound to any specific country or region. We test our code substantially before release.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Me knowingly, we do not have any components or code authored by people at any of the mentioned companies.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So finally my question: can you tell me anything about where or for what you use curl? Is it used in anything in space?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Regards,<br>Daniel</p></blockquote>



<h2>Used in space?</h2>



<p>Of course my attempt was completely in vain and the answer back was very brief and it just said…</p>

<p>Cats rule, and dogs drool. And before you come at me, dog owners, I’m sorry — it’s just a fact.</p>



<p>OK, OK. There’s no reason to argue about which pets are the best, because we already know there are <em>so many</em>&nbsp;benefits to having <em>any</em>&nbsp;kind of animal in your life (and we already know that cats win).</p>



<p>The truth is that all pet owners know that their furry (or feathery or scaly or what have you) friends only make their lives better. But cat owners have science on their side.</p>



<p>That’s right —&nbsp;owning a cat is so good for you, there are actual, proven, scientific benefits. Ready to see exactly how your purry, biscuit-making buddy has been improving your life? Here’s what science has to say about the subject.</p>



<h2>The Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner</h2>



<figure><img width="1024" height="548" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="The Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-324x173.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-416x223.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-768x411.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-60x32.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20548'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-324x173.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-416x223.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-768x411.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-60x32.jpg 60w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>Anywhere between 10 and 30 percent of people call themselves “<a href="https://www.gethuan.com/3-surprising-ways-cats-love-their-owners/"><u>cat people</u></a>.” Not dog people. Not equal-opportunity lovers of all animals. Just cat people.</p>



<p>And naturally, some scientists were a little confused by that. After all, cats seem <a href="https://www.gethuan.com/3-reasons-why-cats-run-away-and-what-you-can-do/"><u>generally ungrateful for our love and affection</u></a>. They can go from enjoying a belly rub to digging sharp claws and teeth into your skin without any warning whatsoever. And then there’s all the barfing —&nbsp;seriously, what makes cats throw up so much?</p>



<p>In other words, scientists wondered what makes people love these little animals that can be <a href="https://www.gethuan.com/lost-indoor-cat-behavior/"><u>emotionally volatile</u></a>, messy, and don’t seem to appreciate a single thing their human subjects do for them.</p>



<p>And those scientists actually found out more than they bargained for. It turns out there are <em>a ton</em>&nbsp;of ways cats make our lives better. They make us happier. They make us healthier. And it’s all been proven (or at least supported) by science.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Sleep Better</h3>

<p>Most people don’t associate cats with good sleep.</p>



<p>They have a bad rap for waking their owners up at the crack of dawn for breakfast, or making noise all night with their nocturnal antics. But science actually shows that sharing your sleeping space with a cat (especially one that cuddles and purrs) can help you get better sleep. <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(15)00674-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>In one study</u></a>, 41 percent of people reported sleeping better with their pets by their side.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Calm You Down</h3>



<p>One thing you probably never expected your cat to be is an instant anti-anxiety tool. But that’s exactly what cats can be, according to science.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.2752/089279399787000237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Studies have shown</u></a>&nbsp;that because cats appear less dependent on their humans than other types of pets, we tend to see them as a strongly calming presence in our lives. Cat owners <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa6be7de17ba3f559d28f25/t/5aa85bc7e2c4839970ff3190/1520982983501/pet_paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>have been shown</u></a>&nbsp;to have lower blood pressure and resting heart rates, and in one study, were more likely to be able to respond to challenges without feeling threatened or overwhelmed.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Improve Your Mental Health</h3>



<p>Want to be happier overall? You need a cat, according to science.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.2752/089279393787002385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>An Australian study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that cat owners largely were more psychologically healthy than people without pets. The people who owned cats reported being more happy, more confident, and less nervous.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerulf_Rieger/publication/50911102_Spouses_and_cats_and_their_effects_on_human_mood/links/00b7d5326dc2cf12c8000000/Spouses-and-cats-and-their-effects-on-human-mood.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Another study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that people with cats reported fewer negative emotions than people without cats. They reported being in a bad mood less often than even people with other kinds of pets.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Reduce Loneliness</h3>

<p>Who needs humans for company? Pets can make great companions, and science shows they reduce loneliness and feelings of seclusion in their owners.</p>



<p>Besides the obvious benefits —&nbsp;when you’re lonely, you can play with, talk to, or cuddle with your cat —&nbsp;<a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/12764/Marsa_Sambola_2017_Quality_AHD_AAM.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>one study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that owning a cat made kids feel less sad and lonely, and made them better enjoy time spent alone, compared to kids who didn’t have cats. We’re sure those benefits extend to grown-ups, too.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Make Friends</h3>



<p>There’s a stereotype that “crazy cat ladies” are socially awkward, but according to science, that’s very far from the truth.</p>



<p>Multiple studies have shown that cat owners are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1983-32714-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>more socially sensitive</u></a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1983-32714-001"><u>trust people more</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.1998.11425085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>like people more</u></a>&nbsp;than non-pet owners. <a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/12764/Marsa_Sambola_2017_Quality_AHD_AAM.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Yet another study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that kids who had cats as pets were better at communicating with their human friends.</p>



<p>“Pets appear to act as ‘social catalysts,’ inducing social contact between people,” that study’s author wrote. “A pet can be accepting, openly affectionate, consistent, loyal, and honest, characteristics that can fulfill a person’s basic need to feel a sense of self-worth and loved.”</p>



<h3>Cats Can Entertain You For Hours</h3>

<p>Anyone who’s ever played with an energetic cat knows just how entertaining they can be.</p>



<p>Cats are natural-born hunters with fierce prey drives, and that means that a ball, a feather, or a piece of string can have them jumping, pouncing, and chasing for hours. Most cats are perfectly content to play by themselves with any object that can be batted across the floor, giving their humans plenty to watch and laugh at.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Encourage You to Get Up and Play</h3>



<p>What’s even better about how playful our feline friends can be is that they encourage their owners to get up and play, too. Sure, you’re probably not going to get as much aerobic exercise with a cat as you would with a dog. But running around the house with a toy on a string, even for just 10 or 15 minutes a day, can provide more exercise benefits than you might think.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Encourage You to Rest and Take Naps</h3>



<p>On the other hand, sometimes the best way to practice some good, old-fashioned self care is to take a nap. Studies have shown that most house cats sleep around 16 hours a day, so if you need some encouragement to slow down and get some shuteye, just look to your cat, an expert at cat naps who would love to take a snooze with you at any time of the day.</p>



<h3>Cats Have Lower Carbon Footprints Than Dogs</h3>



<p>Just another benefit to choosing a cat over a dog: It’s better for the earth. A <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/dogs-eco-footprint-a-hummer-study-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>2009 study</u></a>&nbsp;found that the carbon footprint of owning a dog was about the equivalent of driving a Hummer. On the other hand, owning a cat was like owning a Volkswagen with reduced carbon emissions. Neither pet is perfect, but cats are contributing less to climate change than dogs.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Fight Depression</h3>



<figure><img width="1024" height="630" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="Cats Can Fight Depression" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-324x199.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-416x256.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20630'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-324x199.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-416x256.jpg 416w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>Now for the actual medical benefits of cat ownership — and there are a lot of them. It turns out that owning a cat is exceptionally good for your overall health, both mental and physical.</p>



<p>First up: Mental health. Because they tend to increase happiness and decrease feelings of loneliness and isolation, studies have shown that cats can help alleviate some of the symptoms of clinical depression, since they’re exacerbated by those things.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Lower Your Blood Pressure</h3>



<p>Aside from their mental health benefits, cats can have a positive effect on our physical health, too.</p>



<p>Studies have shown that cat owners have lower blood pressure on average, and that stroking a cat can release hormones that tell our bodies to calm down, lower their heart rates, and lower blood pressure even more. As an added bonus, most cats find stroking to be calming and enjoyable, too.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Reduce Your Risk of a Stroke</h3>



<p>Studies have shown that people who own cats have greatly reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>A 2009 study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that people who currently own cats are at far less risk of cardiovascular problems, and that even people who owned cats in the past but don’t any longer have less risk of these kinds of diseases. The scientists who worked on that study attributed their subjects’ better health to the fact that cats reduce stress and blood pressure, putting less strain on the cardiovascular system over a lifetime and allowing it to stay healthy long term.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Lower Your Cholesterol and Triglycerides</h3>



<p>That same 2009 study showed yet another surprising cardiovascular benefit to having a cat as a pet: They lower your cholesterol and triglycerides. In fact, researchers found that in some cases, getting a cat was more effective at bringing patients’ high cholesterol into a normal range than using medication meant to lower cholesterol.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t exactly sure why cats have this particular benefit for their owners, but there’s no question that owning a cat has positive effects on your overall health.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help Heal Bone and Muscle Injuries</h3>



<p>If you ever injure a bone or muscle or suffer from a minor wound, add this surprising step to your treatment plan: Cuddling with a cat.</p>



<p>Cats purr at a frequency between 20 and 140 Hz, which <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>studies have shown</u></a>&nbsp;can help promote better bone density and help minor injuries heal faster. In other words, your cat’s purr has literal healing powers.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Fight Off Allergies and Asthma</h3>



<p>Well, cats unfortunately can’t do much for your existing allergies. But if you want your children to avoid them, get a cat.</p>



<p>In 2002, the National Institutes of Health released a study that showed that kids who were exposed to cats regularly when they were under a year old were less likely to suffer from all kinds of allergies —&nbsp;in addition to pet dander, those kids were less likely to have dust mite, ragweed, grass, and other allergies.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Live Longer</h3>



<figure><img width="1024" height="680" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="Cats Can Help You Live Longer" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science-324x215.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science-416x276.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20680'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science-324x215.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science-416x276.jpg 416w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/07-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>With all those health benefits, it’s no wonder that cat owners live longer than those who don’t have feline friends in their lives. That just means you have plenty of time to continue to enjoy all the benefits of being a cat lover.</p>



<h3>Can’t Have a Cat? Even Just Watching Cat Videos Can Be Good for You</h3>



<p>Not everyone can have a cat —&nbsp;we understand what a serious commitment any pet is, and why it’s not for everyone.</p>



<p>But if you’d like to reap some of the benefits of having a cat in your life, even if you’re not up for the task of caring for one, just queue up some cat videos online. A <a href="https://www.goodnet.org/articles/7-scientifically-proven-health-benefits-being-cat-owner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>2015 study</u></a>&nbsp;from the University of Indiana showed that watching cat videos gave people an instant mood and energy boost, and decreased their negative feelings throughout the day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If you've been using Typescript, you would have definitely come across <code>string</code> and <code>String</code>. Have you ever wondered which one you should be using? You might have used them interchangeably and they do work. In fact, there are other types like this, <code>Number</code> and <code>Boolean</code>. So what are the differences between the two string types and which one should you be using in your projects? Let's find out.</p><p>Let's have a look at a simple example of how you create strings using <code>string</code> and <code>String</code> in Typescript.</p><p>The first and most basic difference between the two is that <code>string</code> is a primitive type whereas <code>String</code> is an <code>Object</code> type. Okay, so what are the implications of this tiny difference?</p><h2>Your <code>typeof</code> checks will fail</h2><p>Let's look at an example.</p><p>As you can see, the <code>typeof</code> operator when used on a string created using <code>String</code> returns <code>object</code>! This means that you no longer will be able to rely on <code>typeof</code> checks to differentiate between objects and strings. If you have checks based on this assumption, they will now fail!</p><h2>Your equality checks will fail</h2><p>Here, the equality checks using the <code>===</code> operators fail because <code>===</code> not only checks for equality in value but also for equality in type as well. Therefore, even though <code>str</code> and <code>strUsingString</code> have the same value "Hi", <code>str</code> is of type <code>string</code> whereas <code>strUsingString</code> is of type <code>object</code> and hence the check fails. This will lead to bugs which are very hard to debug.</p><h2>Value vs Reference</h2><p>When you create a string as a literal, no matter how many of them you create, they will all point to the same literal in storage. However, when you create a string using <code>String</code>, each one creates a brand new object. </p><p>Let's look at how the following code is represented in memory. </p><p><img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0fhlypn816u90fptejzl.png"></p><p>Now, consider the following snippet,</p><p>This time both the <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> checks fail. This is because what is being actually compared is the address of the memory locations and not the actual value themselves.</p><p>This is a pretty big source of bugs! Just imagine trying to compare two strings and you get <code>false</code> in spite of them having the same value.</p><p>Always use the lowercase versions, <code>string</code>, <code>number</code> and <code>boolean</code>. This will ensure that you do not run into the bugs mentioned above and since the bugs happen at run time, they are very hard to debug. </p><p>Hope you learnt something new. Happy coding and see you in the next one.. :)</p><p>Follow me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sidthesloth92">Twitter</a> or check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://dineshbalaji.in/">website</a> to know more about me..✨</p></div></div></div>]]>

Is there a correlation between business performance and Page Speed performance? What else might we find?</p><p>Using Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights API</a> and 2020 Fortune 500 data, we compiled what we’re calling “The Performance 500”.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17qQh1zKpa5qwNBzXcCgkVbsy-YMHV0DB_doNgktcp8M/edit?usp=sharing"><picture><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-performance-500-chart.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-performance-500-chart.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-performance-500-chart.jpg" width="768" loading="lazy" alt="The Performance 500 (Google Sheets)"></picture></a></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17qQh1zKpa5qwNBzXcCgkVbsy-YMHV0DB_doNgktcp8M/edit?usp=sharing">The Performance 500</a></p><h3>And the Winner Is</h3><p>You’ll notice a recognizable name in first place for the Performance 500: <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a>. Its Chairman and CEO, Warren Buffet, famous for continuing to live in the same house he purchased in 1958, bested even Google’s parent company in page speed performance using a simple HTML site with minimal resources to deliver content. Hats off to you, Warren and team.</p><h3>Other Interesting Findings</h3><ul><li>Only 4 sites out of the 500 (.8%) scored above a 90% or above on their PageSpeed Insights Performance Score</li><li>~85% (424/500) of sites have a Performance Score of less than 50</li><li>The average Performance Score is ~29</li><li>The average Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric is 13.5 seconds(!)</li><li>Less than half of the Fortune 500 had a Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Score of better than .1</li><li>Only 11 of the 500 have "Good" First Input Delay (FID) scores</li></ul><h3>Understanding Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS &amp; FID)</h3><p>A quick reference:</p><ul><li>LCP: Largest Contentful Paint - How long does it take to render the largest element within the viewport (measured in seconds)</li><li>CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift - How often things move around as the page loads (presented as a score value)</li><li>FID: First Input Delay - How soon after a user input does the browser process the event (measured in milliseconds)</li></ul><p>We’ve included <a href="#understanding-core-web-vitals">a section below</a> that explains these in further detail in the language used on <a href="https://web.dev/">web.dev</a>.</p><h3>How We Tested</h3><p>We ran 5 tests at different times of day over a period of two weeks. Those results have been averaged into the scores presented in the table above. PageSpeed Insights never returned a Performance Score for ViacomCBS so we ranked it last.</p><h3>Ranking Methodology</h3><p>We chose to rank these companies “Performance 500” rank first by Google’s PageSpeed Insights Performance Score, then by Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), then by Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), then First Input Delay (FID). We preferred this ranking order as FID is not assigned a weight in <a href="https://web.dev/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-6">Google’s weighting of the performance score</a>.</p><h3>Color Coding</h3><p>We chose to use the green, yellow and red labels using the same color coding scheme used by Page Speed Insights.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>In this issue</h2>
<p>Look, I'm a software engineer by training. I understand why you would wait until your
project is perfect before showing it to someone. However, there's a much better strategy:
the "Minimum Viable Product," or MVP. Instead of building and launching a complete project,
your engineering output consists of two things: a hypothesis and evidence supporting the
hypothesis. Your goal is to refine your hypothesis as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This post will help build your intuition for why it's better to make your MVP as small as
possible, rather than building out a complete and beautiful project. To ruin the ending,
I will show you why building your MVP is correlated with standing still, and iterating with
user feedback is correlated with forward progress.</p>
<h2>Product engineering is a gamble</h2>
<p>The storybook version of building a new product is a happy story. Once upon a time, a
software engineer heard that someone had a problem. They forgot to take their dog for a
walk, and they felt terrible. And think of the poor dog! "I know," the engineer thought,
"I can write a Chrome extension to remind people to do this." And so the plucky engineer
combed through the treacherous extension docs and figured out how to make it happen. They
submitted it to the Chrome Web Store, mentioned it on their Facebook page, and then people
downloaded it and they loved it. Nothing bad happened ever again.</p>
<p>We all know this doesn't happen. Product engineering interacts directly with the real world.
The real world is messy. Let's imagine a world where the engineer asked a pet owner
beforehand. They might have learned that nobody would use this. People aren't
always by their computer. A reminder should be on their phone, not Chrome. And they already
have a calendar that reminds them to do things. And they ignore their
recurring calendar entries anyways because they know they're supposed to do them. And have
you ever owned a dog? They tell you when you forget to walk them. It's hard to misinterpret.</p>
<p>In general, you want to delete your bad ideas as soon as possible. There's a dirty secret of
building software for the real world. You cannot know in advance whether it solves the
user's problems. You can learn that it definitely doesn't, as our engineer learned above
with their Dog Walker Reminder Chrome extension. But once you get past "this definitely
won't work," you don't know if it'll solve a user's problem until you put something in front
of them. It doesn't have to be a full-blown software project. There are tons of examples of
businesses launching with an Excel spreadsheet and a dream. The idea is that you produce the
smallest working thing possible. And then you do it again and again. You delete the bad
ideas and you keep the good ideas. You try to create this feedback loop as tight as
possible to minimize the time you spend with bad ideas.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, I'm going to conflate a few ideas and call them all "MVP." It's
supposed to mean "the smallest possible thing that solves the problem." But I will also
use it to mean "the software you've written before you show anyone," regardless of how
minimal it is. Sorry in advance.</p>
<h2>Launch your damn MVP as soon as possible</h2>
<p>Launch your damn MVP as soon as possible. This whole section is dedicated to showing why
this is a superior approach.</p>
<p>First, the logical argument. Established companies with a decade+ of user research still
don't understand the effect of their changes. There's a reason that they A/B test so
heavily (or for devices, give prototype phones to an ever-increasing pool of people).
As someone creating a new product, you likely don't understand what people might like about
your pre-launch product before you've shown anyone. So you don't know whether your changes
are valuable until you show them to someone else.</p>
<p>Let's build a model that can help us build intuition. If you have extra information - you're
"scratching your own itch" or you've built 100 products in this area and you're sure the
101st will work - then this post isn't for you. I'm reaching out to the developer who is
about to spend 3 months building something that could be done in 10 minutes with a
Squarespace site.</p>
<p>First, let's decide what we're measuring. We will boil the entire value of the product
down to a single variable. We will call this variable "value." A real model would need to
account for dozens of variables that could change in conflicting directions. But we will
keep this simple. There's no marketing, code, customers, anything. Just "value." It may
seem strange to boil an entire business down to a single number. But people do that all the
time when they sell their businesses for cash.</p>
<p>Let's say that every change affects "value" by a fixed amount and a percentage amount.</p>
<pre><code> new_value = m * old_value + b
</code></pre>
<p>This matches my intuition for how changes affect the value of a product. Changes scale with
the amount of traffic that you have. The value of a 1% conversion rate improvement was
dramatically different during my 4.5 years at Etsy, but the amount of work required didn't
change dramatically. This is because the base value of the company grew over time. I think
this is true in general: for large products, changes are percentage changes. It's hard to
imagine changes that add value that aren't multiplied by the number of users, or the number
of sales, etc.</p>
<p>Why add the constant? If every change were a percentage change, then nothing would ever get
done. Anything times zero is zero. You start with zero. Everything would always be worthless
in a world without constant factors. So there is a non-scalable amount of value that is
also created with changes.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to point out that "all models are wrong and some models
are useful." The exact mechanics of how value increases and decreases are beside the point.
The real goal is to show you that it's superior to learn as early as possible.</p>
<p>Anyways! The constant value will be fixed to the range [-1, 1]. We will constrain m to the
range .95 to 1.05. This means that the worst change will regress value by 5%, and the best
change will improve it by 5%. This gets weird in negative numbers, but it didn't
necessarily seem worth fixing since this isn't trying to create a projection.</p>
<p>This means that in this model, half of our changes are positive and half are negative. Your
intuition might say that this is too skewed towards negative. After working in product
engineering for over a decade, I think it's far too skewed towards positive. This means that
I believe that the MVP would actually lose value as you build it, and only start gaining
value once you get feedback on how to fix your regressions. But the model will keep the MVP
value close to zero on average.</p>
<p>If we just blindly submit a big change every 7 days, here's what that looks like. Click
"New simulation!" to see another 2 year outcome.</p>

			<p><span>T</span>he 19th-century physicist Hermann von Helmholtz compared his progress in solving a problem to that of a mountain climber “compelled to retrace his steps because his progress stopped.” A mountain climber, von Helmholtz said, “hits upon traces of a fresh path, which again leads him a little further.” The physicist’s introspection provokes the question: How do creative minds overcome valleys to get to the next higher peak?</p> <p>Because thinking minds are different from evolving organisms and self-assembling molecules, we cannot expect them to use the same means—mechanisms like genetic drift and thermal vibrations—to overcome deep valleys in the landscapes they explore. But they must have some way to achieve the same purpose. As it turns out, they have more than just one—many more. But one of the most important is play.</p> <p>I don’t mean the rule-based play of a board game or the competitive play of a soccer match, but rather the kind of freewheeling, unstructured play that children perform with a pile of LEGO blocks or with toy shovels and buckets in a sandbox. I mean playful behavior without immediate goals and benefits, without even the possibility of failure.</p><figure data-alt="Paul_BR"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/16100_9c0ddedc5328cfa7f7f97cab05b1338b.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>AN EASY GAME TO PLAY:</strong> Paul McCartney has said he dreamed the tune for “Yesterday” and “woke up one morning with this tune in my head.” In dreams, as in play, writes Andreas Wagner, “our minds are at their freest.”</span><span>Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Play is so important that nature invented it long before it invented us. Almost all young mammals play, as do birds like parrots and crows. Play has been reported in reptiles, fish, and even spiders, where sexually immature animals use it to practice copulation. But the world champion of animal play may be the bottlenose dolphin, with 37 different reported types of play. Captive dolphins will play untiringly with balls and other toys, and wild dolphins play with objects like feathers, sponges, and “smoke rings” of air bubbles that they extrude from their blowholes.<br></p> <p>Such widespread play must be more than just a frivolous whim of nature. The reason: It costs. Young animals can spend up to 20 percent of their daily energy budget goofing around rather than, say, chasing dinner. And their play can cause serious problems. Playing cheetah cubs frequently scare off prey by chasing each other or by clambering over their stalking mother. Playing elephants get stuck in mud. Playing bighorn sheep get impaled on cactus spines. Some playful animals even get themselves killed. In a 1991 study, Cambridge researcher Robert Harcourt observed a colony of South American fur seals. Within a single season, 102 of the colony’s pups were attacked by sea lions, and 26 of them were killed. More than 80 percent of the killed pups were attacked while playing.</p> <p>With costs this high, the benefits can’t be far behind. And indeed, where the benefits of play have been measured, they can make the difference between life and death. The more feral horses from New Zealand play, for example, the better they survive their first year. Likewise, Alaskan brown bear cubs that played more during their first summer not only survived the first winter better, but also had a better chance to survive subsequent winters.</p><blockquote><p>Male spiders practice how to copulate fast enough to get away from a female before other males attack them.</p> </blockquote><p>Some purposes of such play have nothing to do with mental problem solving. When horses play, they strengthen their muscles, and that very strength can help them survive. When lion cubs play-fight, they prepare for the real fights that will help them dominate the group. When dolphins play with air bubbles, they are honing their skills at confusing and catching prey. And when male spiders play at sex, they practice how to copulate fast enough to get away from a female before other males attack them.<br></p> <p>But at least in mammals, play goes beyond mere practice of a stereotypical behavior, like that of a pianist rehearsing the same passage over and over again. When mammals stalk, hunt, and escape, they find themselves in ever-new situations and environments. Marc Bekoff, a researcher at the University of Colorado and a lifelong student of animal behavior, argues that play broadens an animal’s behavioral repertoire, giving them the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. In other words, animal play creates diverse behaviors, regardless of whether that diversity is immediately useful. It prepares the player for the unexpected in an unpredictable world.</p><div>

<p>By Kevin Berger</p>

Jonathan Weiner is one of our favorite science writers. He animates topics like evolution and genetics with personal stories about pioneer scientists that read like adventures you don’t want to end. You can go to the Galapagos Islands to marvel...<strong><a href="http://m.nautil.us/issue/19/Illusions/the-last-word-with-jonathan-weiner" data-trval="the-last-word-with-jonathan-weiner" data-trlbl="foc_rec" data-tract="internal_art">READ MORE</a></strong>

</div> <p>That very flexibility can also help the smartest animals solve difficult problems. A 1978 experiment demonstrated its value for young rats. In this experiment, some rats were separated from their peers for 20 days by a mesh in their cage, which prevented them from playing. After the period of isolation, the researchers taught all the rats to get a food reward by pulling a rubber ball out of the way. They then changed the task to a new one where the ball had to be pushed instead of pulled. Compared to their freely playing peers, the play-deprived rats took much longer to try new ways of getting at the food and solving this problem.</p> <p>University of Cambridge ethologist Patrick Bateson linked observations like this more directly to the landscapes of creation when he argued that play can “fulfill a probing role that enables the individual to escape from false endpoints, or local optima” and that “when stuck on a metaphorical lower peak, it can be beneficial to have active mechanisms for getting off it and onto a higher one.” In this view, play is to creativity what genetic drift is to evolution and what heat is to self-assembling molecules.</p> <p>If that is the case, it is hardly surprising that creative people often describe their work as playful. Alexander Fleming, who would discover penicillin, was reproved by his boss for his playful attitude. He said, “I play with microbes ... It is very pleasant to break the rules and to find something that nobody had thought of.” Andre Geim, 2010 Nobel laureate in physics, declared that “a playful attitude has always been the hallmark of my research ... Unless you happen to be in the right place and the right time, or you have facilities no one else has, the only way is to be more adventurous.” When James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helix, they had help in the form of colored balls they could stick together—LEGO-like—to build a model. In Watson’s words, all they had to do was “begin to play.” And C.G. Jung, one of the fathers of psychoanalysis, said it best: “The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.”</p>  <p><span>O</span>ne hallmark of play is that it suspends judgment so that we are no longer focused on selecting good ideas and discarding bad ones. That’s what allows us to descend into the valleys of imperfection to later climb the peaks of perfection. But play is only one means to get there.</p> <p>Less deliberate but just as powerful are the dreams that we experience in our sleep. It is no coincidence that the psychologist Jean Piaget, whose trailblazing research helped us understand how children develop, likened dreaming to play. It is in dreams that our minds are at their freest to combine the most bizarre fragments of thoughts and images into novel characters and plotlines. Paul McCartney famously first heard his song “Yesterday” in a dream and did not believe that it was an original song, asking people in the music business for weeks afterward whether they knew it. They didn’t. “Yesterday” would become one of the 20th century’s most successful songs, with 7 million performances and more than 2,000 cover versions. Another dream whispered to the German physiologist Otto Loewi the idea for a crucial experiment, which proved that nerves communicate through chemicals that we now call neurotransmitters. It would win him a Nobel Prize.</p><blockquote><p>Mind-wandering is staggeringly frequent. The typical mind is absent between a third and half the time.</p> </blockquote><p>Even in the state of half-sleep—psychologists call it hypnagogia—our minds are sufficiently loose to descend from those lowly hills. In this state, August Kekule, saw the structure of benzene, Mary Shelley found the idea for her iconic novel <i>Frankenstein</i>, and Dmitri Mendeleev discovered the periodic table of the chemical elements.<br></p> <p>Similar to playing and dreaming is the wandering of our minds. Ninety-six percent of adult Americans report that it happens to them daily—the other 4 percent may be too absent-minded to notice. To quantify how often any one mind wanders during a task is simple: Ask. Interrupt people who work on the task and ask what’s on their mind. Or let mobile phones do the work for you. Program them to send study participants a text asking what they are thinking about at random times of the day. When psychologists do that, they find that mind-wandering is staggeringly frequent. The typical mind is absent between a third and half the time.</p> <p>Mind-wandering is often considered a harmless quirk, as in the cliché of the scatter-brained professor. But it has real consequences. Let’s begin with the bad ones. Absentminded people perform less well on tests that require focused attention, such as reading comprehension tests. More worrisome, they also perform more poorly on tests that you better not flunk if you have any career aspirations. Among them is the Scholastic Aptitude Test that many colleges require for admission.</p> <p>But mind-wandering also has an upside—at least for well-trained minds. Indeed, many anecdotes of creators like Einstein, Newton, and eminent mathematician Henri Poincaré, report that these scientists solved important problems while not actually working on anything.

<p>Surely you’ve heard of “move fast and break things,” Facebook’s old motto. The intent behind it makes sense: too many of us allow our organizations to operate at a complacent pace rather than actually do anything remarkable. Nonetheless, it misses that mark. The best teams I’ve worked with move faster and, in fact, break fewer things. </p>



<p>Below, I’ve described my tenets for a team to deliver swiftly and reliably. Your team’s likely better at some and worse at others. There’s no requirement to be world-class in all, but every improvement you make to each will boost efficacy. Each one supplies your flywheel with a little more momentum.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=330%2C333&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Velocity Flywheel" width="330" height="333" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?w=1321&amp;ssl=1 1321w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=1016%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1016w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=768%2C774&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=830%2C837&amp;ssl=1 830w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=230%2C232&amp;ssl=1 230w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=350%2C353&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i1.wp.com/avivbenyosef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Velocity-Flywheel.jpg?resize=480%2C484&amp;ssl=1 480w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Velocity Flywheel</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Improving Improving</h3>



<p>At the core of every endeavor that remains successful over a long period of time is the ability to readjust and reinvent continually. Merely sustaining your current state is not enough since teams rarely achieve are at a standstill. If they are not getting faster, they are likely getting slower.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/noticing-change/">Improving Improving</a></em> is my (weird) term for the act of regularly challenging the status quo and ensuring that the team is learning and becoming better. Some leaders are content with their teams not becoming slower as they grow. I claim that you should adopt a mentality that the team should get <em>faster</em> with time. The team’s growth should translate to each member individually, providing more impact and faster (more on that below), and that is only possible with a mindset of continuous learning, improvement, and tweaking. </p>



<p>Are you making the same mistakes repeatedly? Are you solving the root causes of issues or just the symptoms? Ongoing reviews, retrospectives, post-mortems, and so forth are immensely valuable for staying alert and not falling into complacency. </p>



<h3>Impact Focus</h3>



<p>The teams with the best velocity don’t merely type on keyboards faster. No matter how fast you can make it go <em>clackity-clack</em> (even with fancy mechanical keyboards), that is not the best way to increase velocity. Improved velocity comes from making each keystroke more valuable.</p>



<p>Provide your team with enough focus so that it is almost trivial for them to know which ideas are worth the investment and which should be put on the shelf for the time being. Connect them to the company’s objectives, goals, and vision so that they can voice their objections about something involving more effort than is justified for the business. Help them establish enough <a href="https://www.techexecpodcast.com/episodes/product-mastery">Product Mastery</a> to enable effective discourse between them and their partners in the organization.</p>



<p>When teams are focused, each sprint moves the most critical objective forward a mile, rather than nudging a handful forward by a few feet. Overall, teams move faster when they have to spend less time on do-overs due to miscommunications and doing things that didn’t matter.</p>



<h3>Investment in Tech Capital</h3>



<p>The most successful people you know, financially, are not likely constantly fretting about every latte they want to drink, or talking about their credit card debt, managing their loans, and so forth. For some reason, it has become acceptable for entire engineering organizations to focus every free cycle they have on managing their tech debt. Once more, the key is to turn things around and adopt an abundance mentality. How can you create capital, which is boundless, rather than solely try and minimize debt?</p>



<p><em>Tech Capital</em> is an investment in tech that keeps on providing you with value, as opposed to most features developed that require ongoing maintenance and make the system, as a whole, more complex. Some examples of tech capital I’ve recently seen my clients create include DevOps tools that increase the team’s engineering velocity (e.g., creating a testing environment is easy and straightforward), solving things only once (for example, taking the time to make a micro-service a truly global service that can be used by all engineers in the company), and creating force-multiplying capabilities within the organization, such as creating a framework that allows the marketing team to send emails without requiring time from engineering, or an internal tool that makes the data analysts’ work easier.</p>



<h3>Quality Bar</h3>



<p>Referring back to “move fast and break things,” how about… not breaking things? Startups often think that being a startup means that they have a license to create crappy products in the name of agility. That’s not what agility is about, my friends. Once you open the door for low quality, there’s no closing it again—it’s a pandora’s box. Teams that created dingy MVPs for a year until achieving the fabled product-market fit rarely stop being shabby later.</p>



<p>Make sure that you maintain a high-quality bar. Moving fast doesn’t mean bugs, messy code, and a constant rush. Teams that move fast do so in the grand scheme of things by having less shabby code to redo later. When something is done, it is done.</p>



<h3>Tech Depth</h3>



<p>In the current state of our industry, it is becoming increasingly hard to have “8 years of experience” in whatever tools your team use. It is likely those tools didn’t exist that long ago. When frontend work means using a different framework every two years, we tend to lack depth. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, you should set up time and frameworks that allow your people to hone their skills and really get to know their tools. <a href="https://www.codelord.net/2011/02/22/you-owe-it-to-yourself-to-be-old-school/">You owe it to yourself to be old-school</a> (written on my old blog nine years ago), and genuinely <em>grok</em> what’s available for you. We’ve all lost hours to digging through Google search pages and Stack Overflow questions trying to get something to work, only to have someone walk by, hear what we’re talking about, and casually mention an obscure configuration flag that solves the problem.</p>



<p>Great teams should have at least some engineers that obtain this kind of depth in their common tools. That’s achieved either by hiring or internal training. Don’t just cross your fingers and hope it’ll happen naturally.</p>



<h3>Tech Breadth</h3>



<p>Lastly, just as it is incredibly helpful to have a few engineers with tech depth, you should strive to have a wide variety of experiences and knowledge across your organization. It’s common in some places to have engineers teams that are almost entirely homogenous. For example, here in Israel, pretty much every cyber startup starts with teams of people who served together in the IDF. Undisturbed, those teams will continue to grow with a heavy bias towards those same kinds of people. That results in teams that think alike and have the same expertise.</p>



<p>Sometimes, tech breadth can be achieved by having a few people who are jacks of all trades, but, in my experience, it is much better (for this reason and others) to actively strive for diversity and heterogeneousness in your teams. When you sit down to decide on the right approach to tackle a new big feature, it can make all the difference in the world if you have three people from very different backgrounds discuss it together.</p>

This will add the default material to the â€˜Titleâ€™ rectangle.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5568/1*uMPEBPW68WNllN4W1KRweg.png" width="2784" height="1642" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*uMPEBPW68WNllN4W1KRweg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*uMPEBPW68WNllN4W1KRweg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*uMPEBPW68WNllN4W1KRweg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*uMPEBPW68WNllN4W1KRweg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*uMPEBPW68WNllN4W1KRweg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="027f">Now select the material you just created and change its â€˜Shader Typeâ€™ property to â€˜flat.â€™ We chose â€˜flatâ€™ because we are going to add an image to this rectangle and keep its original colors instead of lighting it up with artificial lighting. You can learn more about shader types <a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/articles/textures-and-materials/materials-in-spark-ar-studio#available-materials" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5568/1*KiERhDOq85gwPzlrDF9fQQ.png" width="2784" height="1642" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*KiERhDOq85gwPzlrDF9fQQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*KiERhDOq85gwPzlrDF9fQQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*KiERhDOq85gwPzlrDF9fQQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*KiERhDOq85gwPzlrDF9fQQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*KiERhDOq85gwPzlrDF9fQQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="f4ec">Repeat the same steps for the â€˜Questionâ€™ rectangle.</p><p id="ffbc">Now it is time to add our images. These images will contain the Would You Rather questions. For this tutorial, I have collected 10 fun questions and made them into an image. Download them <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UtC0OpTR2xrD2l0XvG6sKWSE30cBUb6M?usp=sharing" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="6192">You can have as many images/questions as you want for this filter. Remember to have the same file name for the images with a different number at the end eg: ques1, ques2, ques3, etc. We need to do this because we will be importing these images as an <strong>animation sequence</strong>.</p><p id="f310">To do this, click on the â€˜add assetâ€™ button at the bottom of the left assets panel and select â€˜animation sequence.â€™</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5568/1*RKIDHYv7U5sAM9eZnOICxg.png" width="2784" height="1642" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*RKIDHYv7U5sAM9eZnOICxg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*RKIDHYv7U5sAM9eZnOICxg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*RKIDHYv7U5sAM9eZnOICxg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*RKIDHYv7U5sAM9eZnOICxg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*RKIDHYv7U5sAM9eZnOICxg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="a879">Then select the newly created animation sequence in the Assets panel and click on the choose file button under the texture property on the right panel.</p><p id="f628">Now, open the folder where all your images are stored and select them all together and click open. Once done, you should be able to see a new texture created in the assets panel named ques[1â€“10] or whatever you have named your image ranging from 1 to the number of images.</p><p id="f7f5"><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid loss of quality you can click on the texture and select â€˜no compression.â€™ Remember that there is a 4Mb limit on the overall filter file and not using compression may lead to increased memory size for large image files.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5120/1*hU0Wp7HbXRQLjjlrnG1IMQ.png" width="2560" height="1420" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hU0Wp7HbXRQLjjlrnG1IMQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hU0Wp7HbXRQLjjlrnG1IMQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hU0Wp7HbXRQLjjlrnG1IMQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hU0Wp7HbXRQLjjlrnG1IMQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hU0Wp7HbXRQLjjlrnG1IMQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="cd2d">Once you have the questions animation sequence imported, you can import the title screen image. Download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1avuRkxETmO-yWmF2FMk-ky90a7JUg5_D?usp=sharing" rel="noopener">here</a> and simply drag and drop it into the assets panel to import it.</p><p id="ea3a">At this point, we have imported all assets, and itâ€™s time to make the questions appear. First, select the <strong>material</strong> you used on the â€˜Titleâ€™ rectangle and set its texture to the title image you just imported. It may be possible that the image is not visible in the simulator if the â€˜Titleâ€™ rectangle is located above the â€˜Questionâ€™ rectangle in the scene hierarchy.</p><p id="3ff0">Next, set the texture property of the <strong>material</strong> you used on the â€˜Questionâ€™ rectangle to the <strong>Animation Sequence</strong> we created earlier.</p><p id="5249">You will now see the questions appear on the rectangle but they are changing very quickly. By default, the animation is set to 25 frames per second(FPS) and to slow it down you can change the FPS property of the <strong>Animation Sequence</strong> to a lower number eg: 15. Feel free to adjust it to your liking. It is also a good idea to check the â€˜Randomizeâ€™ option so that the animation frame images that contain our questions get shuffled.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5568/1*IsFUVohBIiwcTvMXcYCKew.png" width="2784" height="1642" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*IsFUVohBIiwcTvMXcYCKew.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*IsFUVohBIiwcTvMXcYCKew.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*IsFUVohBIiwcTvMXcYCKew.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IsFUVohBIiwcTvMXcYCKew.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IsFUVohBIiwcTvMXcYCKew.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="a0fe">It is finally time to level up and use the patch editor to add some logic to our effect. At this point, we have the banner visible over the userâ€™s head and it has questions shuffling randomly but indefinitely.</p><p id="f577">The functionality we need to implement in this filter is to add a start and termination point. We can make the questions start shuffling as soon as the user starts recording and then stop at a random one after a few seconds. This is what most filters of this type do, however, you can always tweak it to your liking once we know how to do this.</p><p id="7149"><strong>The Patch Editor</strong></p><p id="2ee7">The patch editor is what makes Spark AR different from its competitor Lens Studio for Snapchat. This editor consists of a drag and drop programming interface similar to that of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> (a tool for children to learn programming). This eliminates the requirement of prior programming experience which makes it the go-to tool for a lot of non-programmers to get into Augmented Reality and explore their creative side.</p><p id="05b5">To activate the patch editor, go to the top menu and select View &gt; Show/Hide Patch Editor.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4104/1*DftWnMCav4yhU6bi7_zl7Q.png" width="2052" height="498" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*DftWnMCav4yhU6bi7_zl7Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*DftWnMCav4yhU6bi7_zl7Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*DftWnMCav4yhU6bi7_zl7Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*DftWnMCav4yhU6bi7_zl7Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*DftWnMCav4yhU6bi7_zl7Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="5b28">This will open the Editor at the bottom of the screen.</p><p id="e867">The patch editor interface uses visual elements called â€˜Patchesâ€™ that represent blocks of code. These patches can be linked with each other via connections to bring about functionality.</p><p id="49fa">To make it super easy for beginners, Spark provides an in-app search &amp; documentation for patches. Right-clicking inside the patch editor will open up a Search window for all the available patches.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3272/1*B2kdxkXxTTagI3wlfjrdig.png" width="1636" height="934" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*B2kdxkXxTTagI3wlfjrdig.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*B2kdxkXxTTagI3wlfjrdig.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*B2kdxkXxTTagI3wlfjrdig.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*B2kdxkXxTTagI3wlfjrdig.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*B2kdxkXxTTagI3wlfjrdig.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2fa7">At times when you need to get an object in the scene or an asset into the patch editor, you can do this by simply dragging them from the left into the patch editor and it will automatically be created as a patch.</p><p id="7afb">All properties of an object that you were able to edit in the inspector panel visually can also be changed via the patch editor. To get a patch for a property, select the object and click on the arrow icon next to the property you want access to in the patch editor and Spark will create a patch for you.</p><p id="e254">To know which patches to use, let us go through the logic flow we need:</p><ol><li id="5085">The â€˜Titleâ€™ rectangle (we added in step 10) displays the initial question to the user by default when the effect is opened.</li><li id="a179">When the user starts recording, the â€˜Titleâ€™ rectangle is hidden and the â€˜Questionâ€™ appears and the shuffling starts.</li><li id="409e">After a few seconds, the shuffling stops and the user answers the question displayed on the screen.</li></ol><p id="d241">Now, to start we need to know when the camera recording begins. To know this, we need to use the â€˜Cameraâ€™ objectâ€™s patch in the patch editor. To get it in, simply drag the â€˜Cameraâ€™ object from the Scene panel on the left into the patch editor. Alternately, you can select the â€˜Cameraâ€™ object and click on the producer patch option in the Inspector pane.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*phw2MyLv4I8gCv7JuFUkvg.gif" width="600" height="334" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*phw2MyLv4I8gCv7JuFUkvg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*phw2MyLv4I8gCv7JuFUkvg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*phw2MyLv4I8gCv7JuFUkvg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*phw2MyLv4I8gCv7JuFUkvg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="1310">Next, we need to change the visibility property of …</p></div></div></section></div>

    <p>Working on a new project and need to keep track of multiple tasks or workstreams? Peergos has
got you covered! We're excited to announce the first in a series of new apps in
Peergos - kanban boards! Our kanban boards are multiple, customisable to-do lists, which help your workflow planning.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Peergos before, it is a peer-to-peer, private storage, social and application platform. You can read more in our book: <a href="https://book.peergos.org/">https://book.peergos.org</a>. Everything we do is <a href="https://github.com/peergos/peergos">open source</a>. </p>
<center>
<img alt="kanban" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/kanban.png" width="90%">
<br>
Stay on top of everything you need to get done with kanban boards in Peergos.
</center>
<p>We love kanban boards! Most of us here at Peergos have used them at various
companies or even personally to stay organised. As much as we love them, we've
always been hesitant to use existing kanban board solutions due to privacy and
security concerns. These boards often contain personal or confidential
information - if you're part of a dev team working on an awesome new product
feature that's going to dominate the market, you absolutely want to ensure that
any details are kept away from prying eyes. So we built our own!</p>
<p>You can now create a kanban board anywhere in your Peergos space - simply click
on our application menu in the top left-hand corner (spoiler alert: you might
see some applications there we haven't told anyone about yet) and then click on the
nifty looking icon. Our boards have all the features you'd expect like dragging
and dropping within and between lists to re-order, easily marking entries as
done, or deleting them.</p>
<center>
<img alt="App menu" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/app-menu-button.png" width="50%">
<br>
Applications menu button
</center>
<p>What makes our kanban boards special? All of the data for a given board is
stored in a single file and end-to-end encrypted so no-one but you can see
what's on your board. Unless, of course, you want other people to see your board!
Just like any other file in Peergos, you can grant your friends read or write access
to your boards, and even share them via secret links, which anyone can use. No need
to worry about complicated access control, everything is securely handled
by Peergos so you can focus on staying organized and getting
things done.</p>
<p>So whether it's tracking your shopping list, planning a big project or managing
your time, try out kanban boards in Peergos. We're using it as an
internal project management tool, and one of our core team members is currently
using a Peergos kanban board to manage their house sale and move! If you don't already have an
account, you can create one for free on <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a>.
Let us know what you think and how we can improve our kanban boards!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for introductions to the other new apps we're building as part of our <a href="https://peergos.org/posts/next-generation-internet">grant</a> from the Next Generation Internet program (<a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI POINTER</a>).</p>

</code></pre><p>I was under the impression that a ‘token’ is an identifier of a given chunk of the input (in our case a <code>SyntaxKind</code>), and that a ‘lexeme’ is a token plus the text that token applies to. Once again it seems that my assumptions about terminology are incorrect: although <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14958865">this StackOverflow answer</a> agrees with my definition of ‘token’, it explains that the word ‘token’ can also be used to describe what I’ve been calling a ‘lexeme’.

				<p>Functional unit and integration tests are a standard tool of any software development organization,
helping not only to ensure correctness of newly implemented code,
but also to identify regressions — bugs in existing functionality introduced by a code change.
The situation looks different though when it comes to regressions related to non-functional requirements, in particular performance-related ones:
How to detect increased response times in a web application?
How to identify decreased throughput?</p>
<p>These aspects are typically hard to test in an automated and reliable way in the development workflow,
as they are dependent on the underlying hardware and the workload of an application.
For instance assertions on the duration of specific requests of a web application typically cannot be run in a meaningful way on a developer laptop,
which differs from the actual production hardware
(ironically, nowadays both is an option, the developer laptop being less or more powerful than the actual production environment).
When run in a virtualized or containerized CI environment, such tests are prone to severe measurement distortions due to concurrent load of other applications and jobs.</p>
<p>This post introduces the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">JfrUnit</a> open-source project, which offers a fresh angle to this topic by supporting assertions not on metrics like latency/throughput themselves, but on <em>indirect metrics</em> which may impact those.
JfrUnit allows you define expected values for metrics such as memory allocation, database I/O, or number of executed SQL statements, for a given workload and asserts the actual metrics values — which are obtained from <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328">JDK Flight Recorder</a> events — against these expected values.
Starting off from a defined base line, future failures of such assertions are an indicator for potential performance regressions in an application, as a code change may have introduced higher GC pressure,
the retrieval of unneccessary data from the database, or SQL problems commonly induced by ORM tools, like N+1 SELECT statements.</p>
<p>JfrUnit provides means of identifying and analyzing such anomalies in a reliable, environment independent way in standard JUnit tests,
before they manifest as actual performance regressions in production.
Test results are independent from wall clock time and thus provide actionable information, also when not testing with production-like hardware and data volumes.</p>
<p>This post is a bit longer than usual (I didn’t have the time to write shorter ;), but it’s broken down into several sections,
so you can pause and continue later on with fresh energy:</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_getting_started_with_jfrunit">Getting Started With JfrUnit</h2>
<div>
<p>JfrUnit is an extension for <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit 5</a> which integrates Flight Recorder into unit tests;
it makes it straight forward to initiate a JFR recording for a given set of event types,
execute some test routine, and then assert the JFR events which should have been produced.</p>
<p>Here is a basic example of a JfrUnit test:</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>By means of a custom <code>assertThat()</code> matcher method for <a href="https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a>,
JfrUnit allows to validate that specific JFR events are raised during at test.
Events to be matched are described via their event type name, and optionally one more event attribute vaues.
As we’ll see in a bit, JfrUnit also integrates nicely with the Java Stream API,
allowing you to filter and aggregate recorded event atribute values and match them against expected values.</p>
<p>JfrUnit persists a JFR recording file for each test method,
which you can examine after a test failure,
for instance using <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/">JDK Mission Control</a>.
To learn more about JfrUnit and its capabilities, take a look at the project’s <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">README</a>.
The project is in an early proof-of-concept stage at the moment,
so changes to its APIs and semantics are likely.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve taken the JfrUnit quick tour, let’s put that knowledge into practice.
Our example project will be the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfr-custom-events">Todo Manager</a> Quarkus application you may already be familiar with from my <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">earlier post</a> about custom JFR events.
We’re going to discuss two examples for using JfrUnit to identify potential performance regressions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_case_study_1_spotting_increased_memory_allocation">Case Study 1: Spotting Increased Memory Allocation</h2>
<div>
<p>At first, let’s explore how to identify increased memory allocation rates.
Typically, it’s mostly library and middleware authors who are interested in this.
For a library such as Hibernate ORM it can make a huge difference whether a method that is invoked many times on a hot code path allocates a few objects more or less.
Less object allocations mean less work for the garbage collector,
which in turn means those precious CPU cores of your machine can spend more cycles processing your actual business logic.</p>
<p>But also for application developers it can be beneficial to keep an eye on — and systematically track — object allocations,
as regressions there lead to increased GC pressure,
and in turn eventually to higher latencies and reduced throughput.</p>
<p>The key for tracking object allocations with JFR are the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> and <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB</code> events,
which are emitted when</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an object allocation triggered the creation of a new thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an object got allocated outside of the thread’s TLAB</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Thread-local allocation buffers (TLAB)</p>
<p>When creating new object instances on the heap,
this primarily happens via <em>thread-local allocation buffers</em>.
A TLAB is a pre-allocated memory block that’s exclusively used by a single thread.
Since this space is exclusively owned by the thread, creating new objects within a TLAB can happen without costly synchronization with other threads.
Once a thread’s current TLAB capacity is about to be exceeded by a new object allocation,
a new TLAB will be allocated for that thread.
In addition, large objects will typically need to be directly allocated outside of the more efficient TLAB space.</p>
<p>To learn more about TLAB allocation, refer to  <a href="https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/4-tlab-allocation/">part #4</a> of Aleksey Shipilёv’s "JVM Anatomy Quark" blog series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note these events don’t allow for tracking of each individual object allocation,
as multiple objects will be allocated within a TLAB before a new one is required, and thus the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> event will be emitted.
But as that event exposes the size of the new TLAB, we can keep track of the overall amount of memory that’s allocated while the application is running.</p>
<p>In that sense, <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> represents a sampling of object allocations,
which means we need to collect a reasonable number of events to identify those locations in the program which are the sources of high object allocation and thus frequently trigger new TLAB creations.</p>
<p>So let’s start and work on a test for spotting regressions in terms of object allocations of one of the Todo Manager app’s API methods, <code>GET /todo/{id}</code>.
To identify a baseline of the allocation to be expected,
we first invoke that method in a loop and print out the actual allocation values.
This should happen in intervals, e.g. every 10,000 invocations,
so to average out numbers from individual API calls.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/security"><p>Security</p></a><p>No software can be 100% protected. Yet the harm it might bring can be minimized with a proper approach to app development and testing.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Security breaches are reported almost every day. Data gets stolen so often there are already services like https://haveibeenpwned.com/ that monitor those attacks and inform if your credentials have been compromised.</p><p>And while you might have only been reading those reports on the Internet, for us as an app building company it's an everyday threat since we're working in probably the most data-sensitive industries: healthcare and fintech. Compromising such data may lead to everything from digital identity theft to life-threatening situations.</p><p>For instance, just recently, a woman had died due to a software failure in a German hospital. That failure was caused by a cyber attack and forced doctors to move the patient to another facility, but she died on her way to it.<br></p><h2>Security Testing as an Answer</h2><p>So what's our way to minimize the possibility of such outcomes? (We can only imagine the feelings of those QA guys who – although most probably unintentionally – overlooked that threat in the software and made this attack possible).&nbsp;</p><p>There's a number of techniques that all can be united by one broad term "security testing". Its scope varies from project to project and may include or combine such activities as finding and removing system vulnerabilities and weaknesses, penetration testing, line-by-line code inspection, and others.</p><p>Instead of diving into technical aspects of our work, we'd like to dedicate a few sentences to its importance.</p><p>Often companies tend to save money on or postpone security testing, mainly due to three reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>Their business is too small/unimportant to be targeted by hackers</li><li>There is no return on investment</li><li>The software can never be perfectly secure OR it's much easier to install some third-party tool for data protection.</li></ol><p>However, that attitude is exactly the reason data breaches happen so often. Yes, databases leak every day, and a single database might be of no significant value. But when they are combined, such new big data provides an enormous amount of information about people, starting with the time they usually come home from work and their most often ordered pizza to the passwords of their email accounts and CVV codes of their credit cards.</p><p>Now, it might seem that security testing is something very vague for a non-technical person. How can you know that your development team is actually working on your product's security?</p><p>Answering this question, any app building company would say something like:</p><blockquote>“– Our QA team finds a unique testing approach for every project, and to do that, they apply experience from the decade of work in this area.”</blockquote><p>Yet in real life, it is only during your interaction with the most reliable teams you'll be getting an answer to that question.&nbsp;</p><p>Most often, you’ll get detailed reports on what vulnerabilities and breaches were found and fixed. But that's not all. Security testing also reveals additional ways to protect user data.<br></p><p>For instance, here is only a couple of things we suggested and developed in our latest projects:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>In one of the healthcare projects, a user was able to download medical files to their device through the app. We programmed the app to automatically delete those files after some time. Not only it is done because a copy may become outdated. We noticed that files are downloaded for a one-time interaction (or importing into another app for further processing).</li><li>In another project, our software was communicating with the client's proprietary scanners. Initially, we intended to work with those scanners remotely. But we decided to have them delivered to our office to check if the hardware might be tampered with to alter its behavior and how our code can prohibit that.</li><li>When we were making an app for the bank, security testing requires having quite an amount of client data, and resources were invested to fake them. It is OK to suppose we might have a breach possibility on our side too.</li></ol><p>You might also know that all healthcare applications in the US must follow the HIPAA Security Standards. Those include solid requirements for data encryption, user identification, emergency access, and other aspects of such software. To follow them, we implement features like password hashing, biometric identification, automatic logoff, file change logging, and others.</p><p>Sometimes we might go as far as to sending our clients <a href="https://sdn.ego-cms.com/s/52Cdd5djCdsTD4s">cheat sheets like this</a> to implement healthcare security practices all over their organization.</p><h2>How Can You See EGO Pays Attention to Security?</h2><p>Now, the main outcome of the successful security testing might seem to be hardly visible. Your app works as intended, and hacks are either unsuccessful or absent at all.<br></p><p>So here are a few security practices we often turn to when working on software projects having risky functionalities (mainly, those include payment features, file uploading, and personal data processing). Seeing them when interacting with your development team, you may be sure the security aspect is treated seriously on your project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Different environments</h3><p>&nbsp;Most of the applications we maintain or improve already have a real-world userbase.</p><p>To make sure we won't affect their user experience, we create different environments:</p><ul role="list"><li>a demo environment to show new or updated functionality to the client</li><li>A staging environment for smoke testing purposes</li><li>A few QA environments for our internal needs (mostly for testing new features separately from each other)</li></ul><p>Additionally, as in the example earlier, we create fake or seed data for testing purposes.</p><h3>Project Permissions</h3><p>It's very common to build MVPs without paying special attention to the user roles and permissions. However, if the project works with data sensitive enough to have its security taken care of, this is a critical issue to address.</p><p>Who can access the code and user data?</p><p>Who can edit it?</p><p>Who can dump it?</p><p>In teams with people combining various roles and responsibilities, those are questions not obvious at all. And the better is the security policy, the less are the chances of internal data theft, a social engineering attack, or a banal mistake.</p><p>As an example, we get our hands on projects that initially allow us to access user data. Many mobile apps let users sign up, and the APIs implementing this functionality provide the developers with the ability to access, dump, or alter the database of users and their passwords.&nbsp;</p><p>In such cases, we change the app logic and permissions to make such data invisible and inaccessible for developers (at least, by default).&nbsp;</p><h3>Payment testing</h3><p>However appealing might be the software product, if the payment procedure is unclear, or, even worse, goes wrong, that might cause a user not only to refuse using your app but leave a negative review and tell about their experience on social networks.</p><p>To make sure the payment procedure works flawlessly, quality assurance engineers from the EGO app development agency create a sandbox and test credentials (a card number, date, random name, etc. for testing purposes.</p><h2>Where's a fly in the ointment?</h2><p>Although we dropped many more boring technical details – like how we perform penetration testing and security auditing – there will still be a question hanging in the air:</p><p><em>Can EGO guarantee your product's security?</em></p><p>The answer is "No", but also "No, and nobody can".</p><p>In September 2020, another zero-day vulnerability was<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-sandbox-activation-enables-zero-day-vulnerability/"> discovered</a> in Windows 10. A zero-day vulnerability means there’s a chance it was found earlier by a trespasser and used for an unknown number of times for an unknown purpose.<br></p><p>Who knows how many more of such vulnerabilities are in the operating system most of our clients use. Clients, who may have access to the code base or the user database of their product. And this is only one of many attack vectors we cannot do anything about.</p><p>And then there are new security testing tools coming out on the market. And new testing approaches. And new people joining our team.&nbsp;</p><p>The growth strategy that our QA team has come up with over the years of their work is finding ways to make better-informed decisions. Decisions on the optimal testing approach for every project, on testing plans and estimates, on testing tools and reports.</p><p>And then, following our decisions, we should never stop paying attention to details. Because if there would be an idiom that would describe the essence of quality assurance, it would be “God is in the detail”.</p><figure><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/contact-us" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5f6cbccfbb5afc0b752a1448_5d30419c6c4ba507b52124bd_App%20Development.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a></figure></div></article><section><div><div><p>LIKE THIS ARTICLE?

<p>Recently I’ve got a message from a coding school. They offer two options to go through their courses. One is cheaper, but without review. You are simply watching prerecorded videos. Other one includes exercises and code reviews. </p>
<p>So, I come up with idea of coding courses where content like video and exercises are open and free for everyone. But, coding review is a paid function. And you can choose a person who will review your code. And price of review will be different. Like you want to hire someone who is more detailed in review or who has some very rare knowledge. You decide. </p>
<p>You choose a reviewer for particular exercises. Exercise may have different levels, like to reverse a string or create a web server. Also reviews can be plain text or recorded video with explanations.</p>
<p>Sure, reviewers have rating and reviews 😉 What do you think about the idea?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I've been reading a couple of books recently, centred around data, data storage, distributed systems and scaling applications. Particularly:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref=asc_df_1449373321/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310831942794&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16585491836571548617&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9046611&amp;hvtargid=pla-432535594773&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems</a></p>
<p>The book starts by running through some of the challenges of data storage, databases and the different approaches to databases. It's been an ambition of mine, to understand a bit more about data storage and databases in general. So I'm going to attempt to implement some of the ideas in these few chapters in particular over the course of several blog posts, as I build on the knowledge. This first post will be very brief, and probably not that interesting, but I need a starting point to build on, so bear with!</p>
<p>I'm going to start by creating a simple key/value API, which takes some raw data, stores it to disk, and allows the user to read the value back from disk again. I'll iterate through various improvements and optimisations, such as creating indexes using B-Trees, things like write-head logs, hash tables, compression/formats, networking etc, in future posts.</p>
<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>
<p>Let's start with a simple test case, and a couple of benchmarks as well, so we can measure our optimisations:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func roundTrip() (interface{}, error) {
	db := NewDatabase(".data")
	if err := db.Write("key", "value"); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return db.Get("key")
}

func TestCanStoreValue(t *testing.T) {
	result, err := roundTrip()
	require.NoError(t, err)
	require.Equal(t, result, "value")
}

func benchmarkRoundtrip(num int, b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i &lt; num; i++ {
		_, _ = roundTrip()
	}
}

func BenchmarkRoundtrip1(b *testing.B) {
	num := 1
	for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
		benchmarkRoundtrip(num, b)
	}
}

func BenchmarkRoundtrip100(b *testing.B) {
	num := 100
	for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
		benchmarkRoundtrip(num, b)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="nowforthecode">Now for the code</h3>
<p>Okay, cool! You'll notice we've defined a bit of an API in our tests. We have a <code>NewDatabase</code> constructor, which takes a 'path'. The path is the location where the data is persisted on disk. Then, of course, we have a <code>Write</code> method and a <code>Get</code>. Pretty straight-forward, we write a value to disk with a given key, then we can use that key to fetch the value back again.</p>
<pre><code>
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"os"
)

// NewDatabase -
func NewDatabase(path string) *Database {
	// If the path already exists, skip the error, that's okay
	// If the path doesn't exist, i.e no error, create it.
	if err := os.Mkdir(path, 0755); err != nil {
		if !errors.Is(err, os.ErrExist) {
			log.Panic(err)
		}
	}
	return &amp;Database{path}
}

// Database -
type Database struct {
	path string
}

func (d *Database) getKey(key string) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", d.path, key)
}

// Write -
func (d *Database) Write(key string, value interface{}) error {
	encoded, err := json.Marshal(value)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	if err := ioutil.WriteFile(d.getKey(key), encoded, 0666); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}

// Get -
func (d *Database) Get(key string) (interface{}, error) {
	data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(d.getKey(key))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	var r interface{}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &amp;r); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return r, nil
}

func main() {
	db := NewDatabase(".data")

	if err := db.Write("key", "value"); err != nil {
		log.Panic(err)
	}

	val, err := db.Get("key")
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(err)
	}

	log.Println(val)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This approach is incredibly crude; we're encoding values into JSON, writing it to disk with the key as the file name. We're using the key to fetch the contents back again and load it back into memory.</p>
<p>Conceptually this is how a database works. It takes values; it writes them to disk and provides a way of loading the data back again.</p>
<h2 id="whythisisntavaliddatabaseyet">Why this isn't a valid database, yet</h2>
<p>This approach is missing several key components and has some glaringly obvious flaws. First of all, this only works locally, databases need a way to run on a network; to take queries, send data over the wire and be accessible to other networked services. Secondly, we're parsing data into JSON and storing it in an encoded string format. Whilst this is incredibly simple, JSON/string data has a lot of formatting and encoding overhead. In other words, at scale, this approach would use vast amounts of space.</p>
<p>Most database engines will use some compression or raw binary encoding format. Think MongoDB's BSON, for example. This set-up also isn't thread safe, we need to implement a lock to prevent multiple concurrent access to our database files.</p>
<p>We're also storing single values in single files, which won't scale. If you have a datastore containing millions of rows, that's millions of files and inodes. Typically database engines have a way of compressing and concatenating values into a more efficient format on disk, which I'll attempt to unpack (literally), in a future post.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So there we have it, a crude, definitely not for production use, data store. Next post, we'll attempt to create a binary format on disk and replace the JSON files.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/thumbnails-blog/ENS%20-%20Introduction%20Guide.jpg"></p>
<p>ENS (<a href="https://ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ethereum Name Service</a>) domains, much like the name entails, are the decentralized Ethereum-based naming system alternative to DNS (Domain Name System).</p>
<p>Both carry out the same basic task. <strong>They are lookup systems</strong> which use domain names to map and reference complex addresses. The difference is that, while DNS uses domain names to translate a website’s underlying IP address, ENS uses .eth suffix domain names to reference <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> addresses, or any other hard to remember resources, like IPFS file hashes or Tor .onion addresses!</p>
<p>Instead of recalling, for example, a 42 character hexadecimal ETH wallet address that looks something like “oxe989eb1ddd3442a24…”, you can replace it with a more familiar ENS domain name that’s easier to remember, like <strong>mywallet.eth</strong>, and make it easier for anyone to make a transfer via an ENS-compatible wallet without typing down the full hexadecimal address.</p>
<p>But, there’s more to ENS domain names than just making memorable wallet addresses, or accessing your favorite IPFS-hosted picture on the go.</p>
<p>ENS opens up the door for websites, Dapps, and more Dweb resources/services to make themselves accessible via a <strong>decentralized, censorship-resistant, and user-controlled</strong> domain naming system.</p>
<p>Unlike DNS, which is handled by centralized authorities, ENS lives on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and is censorship-resistant.</p>
<p>Let’s do an overview of what ENS domains are, why they are important, and how to buy and use them for your IPFS site.</p>
<p><strong>What you will learn on this article:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-ethereum-name-service-ens"><a href="#what-is-the-ethereum-name-service-ens" aria-label="what is the ethereum name service ens permalink"></a>What is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/ENS%20Domains.png"></p>
<p>ENS is an open source, distributed, and community-owned naming system that resides in the Ethereum blockchain. It was developed at the Ethereum Foundation in early 2017, proposed and created originally by the developer Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande.</p>
<p>At its core, ENS is composed of two main pieces. <strong>Firstly, the ENS registry,</strong> which lives in a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain and has a record of all domains and subdomains, detailing the owner, resolver, and caching TTL (time-to-live) for all records under that domain.</p>
<p><strong>The second key piece are resolvers</strong>, which are the actors responsible for translating the ENS domain names into the underlying referenced address or hash. These are also smart contracts on the blockchain, which carry the task of being asked what the “mywallet.eth” domain references, and responding with the resource’s address: ““oxe989eb1ddd3442a24…”.</p>
<p>With those two components we can map the basic ENS architecture and flow. When resolving an ENS address, one first queries the ENS registry for an ENS address → the registry then answers what resolver should be queried for the mapped content → and that resolver in return points the user to the final address or content the domain references.</p>
<p>Right now ENS is growing in popularity and browsers like Opera mobile, MetaMask mobile, or any popular browser using the MetaMask extension supports .eth domains. <a href="http://fleek.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Even in Fleek</a>, ENS domains are gaining a lot of traction! Over 10% of deployments in Fleek are associated with an ENS domain, and over 4000 sites have added an ENS name already.</p>
<p>What’s more, “.eth” is not the only suffix! As of today, some TLDs like .xyz <a href="https://docs.ens.domains/dns-registrar-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">can be registered</a> and claimed on ENS, however “.eth” does still benefit from being exclusively blockchain-native.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-ens-domains-important"><a href="#why-are-ens-domains-important" aria-label="why are ens domains important permalink"></a>Why are ENS domains important?</h3>
<p>Not only ENS offers a decentralized alternative to address complex resources on or off the blockchain with easy-to-read names, but it also is a complementary piece on the <strong>road to decentralizing web/app hosting entirely</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of having Domain Name Registrars like GoDaddy, and DNS Servers, ENS has two decentralized components that cut these middlemen and let the community handle both domain purchases/ownership and resolving.</p>
<p>After all, today in the Web 2.0, <strong>most hosting components are centralized</strong>: Domains, dedicated hosting servers, and CDNs. ENS is the starting point for changing that, by making internet naming decentralized.</p>
<p>And, when combined with <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IPFS</a> (InterPlanetary File System), a distributed, P2P file system, ENS begins to open up the door for getting rid of the centralized, censorship-prone DNS components of Web 2.0, and making <strong>decentralized, P2P and censorship-resistant websites &amp; apps possible</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially because of the fact ENS allows us to access content on decentralized storage like IPFS via decentralized <a href="https://blog.fleek.co/posts/immutable-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">constant links</a>. Remember that, on IPFS, files are identified by their content not by a storage URL. Meaning their addresses/hashes (CID) change every time the content does. Imagine having to change your website’s url every time you made an update!</p>
<p>ENS adoption still needs to grow, and P2P content storage/delivery networks are evolving as well to better achieve this (<a href="https://blog.space.storage/posts/how-is-space-different-from-cloud-storage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">we’re working on that with Space</a>!). But, ENS domains -and the idea behind them- definitely represent the base structure of what hosting and content serving should look like in Web 3.0, because unlike DNS they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized</li>
<li>Immutable</li>
<li>Censorship-resistant</li>
<li>User-owned/controlled</li>
</ul>
<p>And, above all, ENS resides in the Ethereum ecosystem, which is not a minor perk! Rather than being an alternate blockchain/network, it exists in an ecosystem in which it can easily interact with most of the decentralized use cases it pairs up well with: Dapps, Defi, NFTs, DAOs, wallets, etc.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it can integrate all of those use cases under a single address! With DNS,  your domain, identity, payments, and bank are all separate things. ENS can unite it all in a single address that becomes not only your site, but identity, and bank. After all, not only it can carry an IPFS hash, but ETH, or BTC addresses and more things at once. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-buy-ens-domains-and-register-them"><a href="#how-to-buy-ens-domains-and-register-them" aria-label="how to buy ens domains and register them permalink"></a>How to Buy ENS Domains and Register Them</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/I%20want%20one%20ENS.jpg"></p>
<p>Let’s get started on your road to decentralizing your website using ENS and IPFS. The first step you need to take is <strong>registering an ENS domain.</strong> We’ll use ENS’s dashboard as an example, and then follow Fleek’s flow for integrating it with your IPFS-hosted site.</p>
<p>The acquisition, ownership, and registration aspect of ENS is decentralized as well.</p>
<p>Initially, domain name auctions lasted three days, in which a Vickrey Auction process was executed. Someone opened an auction for a name they wanted to buy, people bid for three days, and the winner owned the domain until they released it and recovered their funds. This, however, promoted domain squatting/hoarding, and a new model was introduced.</p>
<p>As of last year, <strong>you can buy and register ENS domains instantly</strong>, with a slight one minute delay. Instead of paying an undefined fee, there is a <strong>yearly rent</strong> model which costs approximately USD$5 payable in ETH (some domains are slightly more expensive due to popularity). These funds now go to <a href="https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/what-will-ens-do-with-all-that-rent-money-heres-what-you-need-to-know-c7fe26a7e0e9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">initiatives and grants</a> to help maintain/develop ENS and the Ethereum ecosystem overall.</p>
<p>Let’s go over the registration process.</p>
<h3 id="1-go-to-the-ens-domain-application"><a href="#1-go-to-the-ens-domain-application" aria-label="1 go to the ens domain application permalink"></a>1. Go to the <a href="https://app.ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ENS domain application</a>.</h3>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/ENS%20Application.jpg"></p>
<p>To register your first ENS domain, visit the <a href="https://app.ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ethereum Name Service app </a>and search for an address/name you want to register and is available. At the moment, you can register domains that are a minimum of 3 characters long (no maximum limit), and you can include emojis.</p>
<h3 id="2-connect-to-the-main-network"><a href="#2-connect-to-the-main-network" aria-label="2 connect to the main network permalink"></a>2. Connect to the Main Network.</h3>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/ENS%20Connect.gif"></p>
<p>To pay for the registration fee of your ENS domain, and declare your ownership for it, you will have to connect to the Mainnet using one of the offered integrations (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Portis, Torus, Authereum, MEW wallet). We’ll use <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MetaMask</a> for this example.</p>
<h3 id="3-define-registration-period-and-confirm"><a href="#3-define-registration-period-and-confirm" aria-label="3 define registration period and confirm permalink"></a>3. Define Registration Period and Confirm</h3>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/ENS%20Registration%20Period.png"></p>
<p>Choose for how long you will want to rent that domain, and verify the final ETH fee to pay. Once you’re good to go, hit “Request to Register” and a transaction will begin. It takes about one minute to verify because during that period the platform is verifying no one else already tried or is trying to acquire the same domain.</p>
<p>If everything is good, your wallet will pop up to execute the final transaction, and confirm your ownership and purchase.</p>
<h3 id="4-review-details-and-setup-renewal-reminder"><a href="#4-review-details-and-setup-renewal-reminder" aria-label="4 review details and setup renewal reminder permalink"></a>4. Review Details and Setup Renewal Reminder</h3>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/ENS%20Domain%20Details.jpg"></p>
<p>Once your transaction is successful, you will see a page similar to the one above (using the ens.eth domain as an example). Let’s go over the details on this page.</p>
<p><strong>The registrant</strong> is the owner of the ENS domain, in this case, it will be you! The registrant can set the controller address, change the resolver, or transfer the registration to a new owner.</p>
<p><strong>The controller</strong> can be seen as the account or user who is in charge of changing the content/addresses/records on this domain, and create or manage subdomains. By default, the registrant will be the controller, but it can be modified.</p>
<p><strong>The resolver</strong> is a smart contract that handles the translation from your ENS domain name to the content you actually link it to. By default, it is set to the Public Resolver managed by the ENS team but it can be modified for custom resolver contracts.</p>
<p><strong>The expiration date</strong> is your renewal date for this domain, when you will have to pay again to maintain the domain’s ownership for a new period. Anyone can choose to pay to renew your domain’s ownership, without them gaining any control over it. <strong>Set up a reminder</strong> for your renewal date using the “Remind Me” button, which allows you to schedule an event in your calendar, or specify an email address where a notification will be sent.</p>
<p><strong>The records</strong> in your domain are where the magic happens! Here you can specify all the resources/addresses that your ENS domain name references. For example, an ETH, BTC, LTC, or DOGE address, content such as the IPFS hash to your website, or text records for things like email or Twitter handles.</p>
<p>Each time you modify a record, there is a ETH gas transaction to be paid. Usually, this is a manual process that you have to do each time you make a new deployment for your website, but we’ll show you later how to automate it using Fleek! A quick spoiler: Fleek covers the …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Gamer diskutieren derzeit über deutsche DIN-Schachtdeckel in einem weltbekannten Computerspiel. Den RSV freut's.</strong></p>
<p>Im amerikanischen Schauplatz des Spiels "Cyberpunk 2077" kommen Schachtabdeckungen nach deutscher Bauart zum Einsatz – allerdings dort, wo es eigentlich nicht DIN-konform wäre. Nach ersten Diskussionen in sozialen Netzwerken gibt es nun sogar schon eine - nicht ganz ernst gemeinte - <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-cyberpunk-developers-fix-the-manhole-covers-in-cyberpunk-2077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petition</a>, die die Entwickler zu mehr Sorgfalt auffordert.</p>
<p><strong>RSV: Endlich mehr Aufmerksamkeit für unsere Branche</strong></p>
<p>Volle Unterstützung gibt es auch vom RSV: "Wir freuen uns über die wachsende Anerkennung für diesen bisher unterbelichteten Bereich in der Öffentlichkeit und hoffen, dass die Entwickler dieses Detail der DIN-Norm zuliebe ausbessern", sagt RSV-Geschäftsführerin Reinhild Haacker dazu, nicht ohne Augenzwinkern. "Deutsche Qualität und Normen liegen uns beim RSV am Herzen. Es ist beruhigend zu wissen, dass deutsche Schachtdeckel – zumindest nach Einschätzung der Gaming-Entwickler – in 57 Jahren zum Einsatz kommen werden, und das sogar in den USA. Dennoch sehen wir uns verpflichtet, im Sinne der Qualitätssicherung darauf hinzuweisen, dass eine DIN 4271 Schachtabdeckung nicht, wie im Spiel gezeigt, auf einer Fahrbahn verbaut werden darf."</p>
<p><strong>Gamer stoßen Petition an</strong></p>
<p>In dem Computerspiel, das derzeit millionenfach gespielt wird, schlüpfen Gamer in die Rolle eines Hackers in einer fiktiven US-Metropole im Jahr 2077. Deutsche Fans des Spiels teilten auf Twitter und in Gaming-Foren Bilder des falsch verbauten DIN-Schachtdeckels, bevor sie scherzhaft eine <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-cyberpunk-developers-fix-the-manhole-covers-in-cyberpunk-2077">Petition</a> zum Thema einleiteten.</p>
<p>Für das Spiel hatten die polnischen Entwickler übrigens sogar Stadtplaner engagiert, um möglichst realitätsnah rüberzukommen. Möglicherweise haben die vollmundigen Ankündigungen auch dazu geführt, dass Gamer - mit der gewohnten deutschen Gründlichkeit - besonders genau hinschauen.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Emma Garber began dancing aged three. By the time she was a teenager â€“ following years of dedicated, exhausting, sometimes painful training â€“ it was her burning ambition to become a professional ballet dancer. â€˜I think around age 14, I sat my parents down and I said: <em>This is what I want to do with my life. This is what makes me happy</em>,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>All of us have dreams and hopes for our future. They are often career-focused, but not always. Some people dream of starting a family or living in another country, for instance. Our dreams form part of our identity, giving us purpose and direction. That is, until reality gets in the way, as so often happens: the change might come from within us, as our passion wanes, or the obstacles to realising the dream might become insurmountable (or a mixture of the two).</p>
<p>Garberâ€™s dream began to fade amid burnout and doubt during her freshman year at the University of Massachusetts. After a particularly terrible dance class, she recalls: â€˜I was like, <em>I donâ€™t think I want to do this for the rest of my life</em>. I stood up, I walked out, I called my mom and I was like, <em>I donâ€™t even know what I want to do with my life anymore</em>.â€™</p>
<p>You might be experiencing one of these unsettling fork-in-the-road moments yourself. Perhaps the dying breath of a fading dream is leaving you with intense feelings of regret and failure. You might fear how others will judge you. After all, in todayâ€™s culture, in many parts of the world, weâ€™re taught from a young age that success is born from stubborn perseverance.</p>
<p>â€˜To be gritty,â€™ writes the psychologist Angela Duckworth in her bestselling <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/110/1109188/grit/9781785042669.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>Grit</em> (2016), â€˜is to fall down seven times, and rise eight.â€™ The gist of her advice has echoed through different eras. â€˜Many of lifeâ€™s failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up,â€™ wrote the inventor Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Given this dominant narrative of the virtues of perseverance, and considering how our ambitions can become a core part of our sense of self, itâ€™s understandable that you might be finding it difficult and unsettling to face the prospect of losing your dream. You can take comfort, though, in knowing that being adaptable and flexible in oneâ€™s ambitions is just as important as being gritty or determined. â€˜By definition, if you cannot achieve what you want to achieve, you will fail repeatedly if you donâ€™t stop,â€™ says Carsten Wrosch, a psychology professor at Concordia University in Montreal, who has been studying the construct of â€˜goal adjustment capacityâ€™ for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Goal adjustment capacity â€“ which psychologists <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12492" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">see</a> as a beneficial form of â€˜self-regulationâ€™ or â€˜self-managementâ€™ â€“ encapsulates two key components: the ability to disengage from fruitless goals and the ability to reengage in new, more productive goals. You could see it as knowing when and how to switch from one dream to another. Itâ€™s measured by agreement with questionnaire items such as â€˜Itâ€™s easy for me to stop thinking about the goal and let it goâ€™ and â€˜I tell myself that I have a number of other new goals to draw upon.â€™</p>
<p>Wrosch says that people who lack this capacity are inclined to â€˜bang their head against the wallâ€™ when theyâ€™re confronted by an unobtainable goal, and, long-term, theyâ€™re more prone to stress and chronic illness. In contrast, those with greater adjustment capacity â€˜have a much easier timeâ€™ â€“ they decommit to the fruitless goal and find a different ambition to pursue. The virtues of being flexible and adaptable are also recognised by careers researchers, who <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879116300604" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">refer</a> to â€˜career adaptabilityâ€™, aspects of which involve being curious about new opportunities and being confident in oneâ€™s ability to learn new skills. People who score highly in this trait are generally â€˜happier. They perform better. They get promoted â€¦ Just a whole range of good things,â€™ says Rajiv Amarnani, a lecturer in the University of Western Australia Business School. That youâ€™re contemplating giving up your dream suggests that you have a healthy willingness to adjust and adapt, which is to your advantage.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re nonetheless finding it difficult to look beyond the immediate sense of loss or failure, know that there are routes ahead and that other opportunities will emerge. By having the wisdom and flexibility to know when to let go, or when to redirect your passion, youâ€™ll be following in the footsteps of many who have achieved greatness. David Foster Wallace let go of his tennis-greatness dreams and became an acclaimed novelist and writer instead. Meanwhile, Roger Federerâ€™s dreams of tennis greatness came true, but only at the expense of his dream of becoming a professional footballer. And Maryam Mirzakhani let go her childhood dream of becoming a novelist but went on to be awarded the Fields Medal for mathematics in 2014 â€“ the first and only woman ever to receive the honour.</p>
<p>These are dramatic examples, but they show that the path to fulfilment isnâ€™t always smooth or direct. Once youâ€™ve come to terms with your loss, youâ€™ll find other passions. New dreams await.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Come to terms with your decision</strong></p>
<p>As you let your dream go, you might be agonising over whether youâ€™re making a mistake. â€˜Thereâ€™s no good answer, thereâ€™s no formulaâ€™ for deciding whether to plough on or give up, says Wrosch. However, he recommends bearing in mind a phenomenon known as â€˜goal shieldingâ€™ â€“ when weâ€™re highly focused on a particular dream or ambition, we tend to filter out inconvenient information that might imperil the project. â€˜Motivational psychologists call it an â€œimplemental mindsetâ€�,â€™ says Wrosch. â€˜If you cross the Rubicon, you focus on what you want to achieve, and you donâ€™t have that balance [in how you process the situation] any more.â€™ For that reason, he says most us are, if anything, probably more at risk of stubbornly pursuing a dream for too long than giving up too early.</p>
<p>The author and entrepreneur Seth Godin agrees with Wrosch â€“ â€˜thereâ€™s no calculusâ€™ for deciding when to give up, he says. He too warns that most of us â€˜lie to ourselves all the time about whether we have the resources to get through the dipâ€™. â€˜The dipâ€™ is Godinâ€™s term â€“ taken from his 2007 <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/300938/the-dip-by-seth-godin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> of the same name, and subtitled <em>A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)</em> â€“ that he says refers to the â€˜difficult space in between the joy of starting and the benefit of getting to the other sideâ€™.</p>
<p>One way to think about this emotionally difficult moment is as a chance to be objective about your dream. Was pursuing it coming at great personal cost, in terms of your relationships and other goals in life? If so, that would suggest it was what psychologists call an â€˜obsessive passionâ€™ and youâ€™re wise to give it up (as distinct from a â€˜harmonious passionâ€™ that fits well into the rest of your life).</p>
<p>Also, try to think, if you can, more like a â€˜healthy perfectionistâ€™: recognise that letting go of your goals doesnâ€™t cast some final verdict on you as a person, and acknowledge the influence of circumstances beyond your control. Remember too that success isnâ€™t all or nothing â€“ although you might not have fulfilled your dream in its entirety, you will likely have learned much along the way, and you now have the chance to redirect your energy and passion in new ways. This is also a good time to seek the counsel of close family and friends. Theyâ€™ll be able to help you view your situation objectively and come to terms with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Be realistic about what you just gave up</strong></p>
<p>When you decide to let go of a dream, itâ€™s almost inevitable that itâ€™s going to hurt, at least for a time, but there are ways to ease the discomfort and move on. â€˜My approach to this is starting with the tragic realism of it, that itâ€™s going to be hard, itâ€™s going to hurt,â€™ says Amarnani, who likens the experience of giving up a dream to a romantic breakup. â€˜To have an ambition is to have this vision of your future self, and to drop that is to drop a piece of you,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>That parallel with relationships offers an effective clue for how to cope. In the context of romantic relationships, Amarnani says that it can be therapeutic to be realistic, rather than idealistic, about the person youâ€™re breaking from, even to focus deliberately on their flaws. If weâ€™re honest, many of our dreams are romanticised, and itâ€™s worth remembering that what youâ€™re giving up is not that fantasy version of the future. We think of doctors as healing people, says Amarnani, or that staff at the United Nations are building peace, but then their daily reality is often far more mundane â€“ doctors are navigating the bureaucracy of their healthcare system; workers at the UN are pushing paperwork around.</p>
<p>Amarnani speaks partly from personal experience. He once harboured a dream to become a computational cognitive neuroscientist, but he suffered repeated rejections and then the financial crisis hit. He changed gears to become a management scholar â€“ â€˜I thought I was selling my soul,â€™ he says, â€˜but really what I was doing was just adjusting to the situation, being adaptable and trusting that, when you try something new, the passion will come.â€™ To help make peace with his decision, Amarnani focused on the negatives of the field he gave up â€“â€˜Decades of research on the brain has taught us next to nothing about the mindâ€™ â€“ and today he couldnâ€™t be happier that he gave up his dream. â€˜I grieved, genuinely,â€™ he says, â€˜but life does go on.â€™</p>
<p><strong>Find a new passion</strong></p>
<p>Itâ€™s a clichÃ© to say that one door closing means another opening, but itâ€™s true. By letting go of an impossible dream, youâ€™re freeing yourself to put time and effort into a potentially more rewarding project. Itâ€™s tempting to look at a high achiever such as Godin and assume that he arrived at his …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Shawn Wang aka swyx. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>If there’s a golden rule to learning, it’s this one.</p>



<p>You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people “learn in private”, and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that’s fine, but we’re here to talk about being in the top quintile. What you do here is to have a habit of creating learning exhaust. Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets. Speak at meetups and conferences. Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. (Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discourse, they’re not public.) Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams. Start a newsletter. Draw cartoons (people loooove cartoons!). Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning. Don’t judge your results by “claps” or retweets or stars or upvotes – just talk to yourself from 3 months ago. I keep an almost-daily dev blog written for no one else but me.</p>



<p>Guess what? It’s not about reaching as many people as possible with your content. If you can do that, great, remember me when you’re famous. But chances are that by far the biggest beneficiary of you trying to help past you is future you. If others benefit, that’s icing.</p>



<p>Oh you think you’re done? Don’t stop there. Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank them, and ask questions. Make PR’s to libraries you use. Make your own libraries no one will ever use. Clone stuff you like. Teach workshops. Go to conferences and summarize what you learned. Heck, go back to your own bootcamp to tell alumni what’s worked for you. There’s always one level deeper. But at every step of the way: Document what you did and the problems you solved.</p>



<p>The subheading under this rule would be: <strong>Try your best to be right, but don’t worry when you’re wrong.</strong> Repeatedly. If you feel uncomfortable, or like an impostor, good. You’re pushing yourself. Don’t assume you know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong. Wear your noobyness on your sleeve.</p>



<p>People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to <strong>be</strong> good? No objections, no hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong. Of course, if they get abusive block them.</p>



<p>Did I mention that teaching is the best way to learn? Talk while you code. It can be stressful and I haven’t done it all that much but my best technical interviews have been where I ended up talking like I teach instead of desperately trying to prove myself. We’re animals, we’re attracted to confidence and can smell desperation.</p>



<p>At some point you’ll get some support behind you. People notice genuine learners. They’ll want to help you. Don’t tell them, but they just became your mentors. This is very important: <em>Pick up what they put down</em>. Think of them as offering up quests for you to complete. When they say “Anyone willing to help with ______ ______?” you’re that kid in the first row with your hand already raised. These are senior engineers, some of the most in-demand people in tech. They’ll spend time with you, 1 on 1, if you help them out (p.s. and there’s always something they want help on). You can’t pay for this stuff. They’ll teach you for free. Most people don’t see what’s right in front of them. But not you.</p>



<p>“With so many junior devs out there, why will they help <em>me</em>?”, you ask.</p>



<p>Because you learn in public. By teaching you they teach many. You amplify them. You have one thing they don’t: a beginner’s mind. You see how this works?</p>



<p>At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 80% of developers are “dark”, they don’t write or speak or participate in public tech discourse. But you do. You must be an expert, right? Don’t tell them you aren’t. Answer best as you can, and when you’re stuck or wrong pass it up to your mentors.</p>



<p>Eventually you run out of mentors, and just solve things on your own. You’re still putting out content though. You see how this works?</p>



<p>Learn in public.</p>



<p>— swyx</p>



<p>p.s. Eventually, they’ll want to pay you for your help too. A lot more than you think.</p>

        <p><em>Julia is a fast, flexible and robust language. Having used Julia for 2 weeks, and Python for 7 years, I can already say I prefer Julia. It is not as mature as Python, but I believe it has the potential to far exceed it.</em></p>



<p>It was Ars Technica’s “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-julia-programming-language/">The unreasonable effectiveness of the Julia programming language</a>” that finally convinced me to learn the Julia programming language.
For years, I’ve heard whispers and glowing praises about Julia. 
It’s a dynamic programming language, but is said to be much faster than Python, and even as fast as C.
The terse, clean syntax is supposed to allow very generic but also robust code creation, reducing friction to collaboration. 
On top of that, it has math friendly syntax like in Matlab or R but also with real maths symbols. 
All of this has been driving adoption of Julia in academia, a highly scientific, collaborative environment with very high computational needs.
The adoption in industry has been predictably slower.</p>

<figure id="SIR model">
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/julia-review/SIR%20epidemic%20model.png" alt="SIR model">
	<figcaption>A snapshot of agents moving around a grid with an infection spreading when they touch, and the resulting infection outbreak graphs. Generated by the author using Julia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So does Julia live up to the hype? I decided to find out.
To this end, I completed the recently released Julia Academy course “<a href="https://juliaacademy.com/p/computational-modeling-in-julia-with-applications-to-the-covid-19-pandemic">Computational Modeling in Julia with Applications to the COVID-19 Pandemic</a>”.
This is a 16 hour course which works with real Covid-19 pandemic data, and teaches you how to implement SIR epidemiology models as well.<sup id="fnref:SIR" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:SIR">1</a></sup>
See the above picture.
After completing this course I challenged myself to rewrite my Random Forest Python <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/randomForests">code</a> in Julia and also my corresponding blog <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/coding/2020/09/29/random-forests.html">post</a>.
You can see the Julia code <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl">here</a> and the twin blog post <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/coding/2020/12/14/random-forests-jl.html">here</a>. 
This resulted in code of similar length, but that was 9 times faster and that felt much more robust.</p>

<p>The table below has a quick comparison of the Python and Julia Random Forests fitting times.
This was on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sriharipramod/bank-loan-classification/">Universal Bank Loan</a> data, with 4000 training samples and 1000 test samples.
The random forest had 20 trees, with each tree having 40 to 120 leaves. 
Tests were run from the Anaconda CMD and Julia REPL.</p>

<p>Scikit-learn (written in Cython) is still the fastest, but that code is more heavily optimised than mine, and also it use parallel processing.</p>

<p>In general, my experience with Julia was very positive. 
It is indeed fast and powerful, and the syntax is very nice.
It is not an upgrade to Python, but I am going to frame much of this article as such.
It operates under some very different paradigms - for example, Julia is very much a functional programming language, whereas Python is object-orientated.
The creators themselves tried to integrate the best of several different languages into Julia including Python, R, Matlab, Ruby, C and Lisp
(see their 2012 <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">release statement</a>). But my experience is mostly with Matlab, C++ and Python. 
Of these, Julia is most likely to replace the code I write with Python.</p>

<p>C++ is a complex and powerful static typed language with memory management capabilities, and I don’t see Julia replacing mission critical software written with it.
Matlab is proprietary software which has great support for specialised scientific computing.
Its Simulink control software and image processing toolbox are the nicest of their kind that I’ve used.
Python, however, is a different story.</p>

<p>Python is easy to learn and lovely to tinker with, but as soon as your project expands that joy dissipates.
It’s noticeably slower than other languages. It has no type checking and very generous scoping rules.
This makes you think less when writing your own code, which is great, but it makes you think <em>more</em> when reviewing someone else’s.
Did they intend this variable to be an array? A string? A custom type? Have I accidently reused an identifier?
Popular packages go out of their way to <em>not</em> use Python for core processing, including Numpy, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow (they use, C, C++ and Cython).
Julia promises to fix these many issues, and it’s a relief.</p>

<p>I want to state upfront that my main frustration with Julia is that it is not as mature as Python.
The release of Julia 1.0 was just over two years ago; Python 1.0 was released 25 years ago.
The Julia community is playing catch-up with Python and has the second-mover advantage of knowing what works and what doesn’t.
But there simply are not as many packages, features, tutorials or videos as Python has. 
Fewer people ask questions on StackOverflow or Discourse.
Like many open-source projects, the documentation is often lacking.<sup id="fnref:pie" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pie">2</a></sup>
The language itself is changing fast, and some code on Julia Academy’s own online tutorials is already out of date.<sup id="fnref:out_of_date" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:out_of_date">3</a></sup>
Then there is all the massive amounts of legacy code in companies and institutions.
So if you’re a beginner programmer, you can stop reading now. My advice is focus on Python. It has more resources and will get you further.
But if you can relate to my frustrations with Python or have more of your own, read on.</p>



<p>So what makes Julia special? A good summary is given by Serdar Yegulalp at <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3241107/julia-vs-python-which-is-best-for-data-science.html">www.infoworld.com</a>, which I’ll briefly repeat here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Julia is just-in-time (JIT) compiled, not interpreted. Furthermore, it is type-specific compiled for each datatype. 
For example, the same function will be compiled differently if integers are passed to it instead of floats. 
This means compiled Julia code can be heavily optimised and therefore is fast.
A downside is that the first call where JIT compiling takes place is slow.
A more detailed explanation can be found at <a href="http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/7-julia-gotchas-handle/">ww.stochasticlifestyle.com/7-julia-gotchas-handle/</a>.</li>
  <li>Julia uses multiple dispatch to combine the benefits of dynamic typing and static typing. 
In short, multiple methods with different argument types can exist for a single function and Julia will choose the best one to use at compile time.
To facilitate  this, Julia has a comprehensive type system which can easily be extended.
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY">video</a> by one of the founders explains this concept the best.</li>
  <li>Julia has a terse and straightforward syntax. It has 32 keywords (compared to Python’s 35 and C++’s original 63, now 97). 
Of these, 16 have a direct parallel with a Python keyword.</li>
  <li>Julia comes with expansive Base and Core modules. A further 12 of the Python keywords are provided by functions and operators in these modules.
These modules are mostly written in Julia which makes them easily accessible and extendable.</li>
  <li>Julia has full Unicode support and mathematical-like notation. The following is a fully working piece of code which can be copied directly into the Julia REPL: 
<span><code>gaussian(x, μ, σ) = 1/(σ*√(2π))*exp(-(x-μ)^2/(2σ^2))</code></span>. A disadvantage is that string indexing sometimes breaks because Unicode characters can take two or more bytes. 
So Base functions like <code>isascii()</code>, <code>nextind()</code> and <code>eachind()</code> should be used to handle strings properly.</li>
  <li>Julia supports metaprogramming, such as macros (like in C++) and creating expression objects with the keyword <code>quote</code>. So Julia programs can generate other Julia programs.</li>
  <li>Julia can call Python, C, and Fortran libraries. This is presumably to facilitate  crossover to Julia.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next three sections are <a href="#Things I like about Julia">Things I like about Julia</a>, <a href="#Neutral issues about Julia">Neutral issues about Julia</a>, 
and <a href="#Things I dislike about Julia">Things I dislike about Julia</a>.
Lastly there are small <a href="#Annoyances">Annoyances</a> I would like to vent after using it for 2 weeks.
I guess no programming language is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-like-about-julia">Things I like about Julia<a id="Things I like about Julia"></a></h2>

<p>Like all programming languages, there was a learning curve to Julia. This was made more difficult by the lack of resources. 
However generally it was easy to learn coming from a Python background and there are many things I definitely  prefer about Julia.</p>

<h4 id="the-type-system-and-multiple-dispatch">The type system and multiple dispatch</h4>
<p>This really does balance controlling types with giving the user flexibility.
For my random forest <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl">code</a>, it essentially provided a way to make object specific functions, even though Julia is a functional language.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/DecisionTree.jl#L203"><code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/RandomForest.jl#L104"><code>RandomForestClassifier</code></a> have different <code>fit!()</code> methods associated with each of them.
I had no problem calling the <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> <code>fit!()</code> method from within the  <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> <code>fit!()</code> method.</p>

<p>A mistake I made at first is to use <code>AbstractFloat</code> inside the struct, whereas the recommendation is to always have concrete types in definitions.
This definitely slowed down my code, which is why I added the type to the struct definition: <code>DecisionTreeClassifier{T}</code>.
I also added an outer constructor to set this to <code>Float64</code> as a default.</p>

<p>Multiple dispatch can easily be abused because finding the best fit is a problem that grows exponentially with the number of different arguments.
However most functions have a very low number of methods associated with them.<sup id="fnref:exceptions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exceptions">4</a></sup>
Another fault is that sometimes it is not fully unambiguous which method should be called, especially with <code>Union</code> data types. 
But this is being worked on and clearer rules should be published in the future.</p>

<p>A prime advantage of the type system is on display with my <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/Classifier.jl#L35"><code>score()</code></a> function. 
For my Python code, I wrote a separate score function inside the <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> and <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/randomForests/blob/1b3737097e8d80a947aa880ce20038db09016383/TreeEnsemble.py#L98"><code>RandomForestClassifier</code></a> classes.
They are however essentially identical functions.
For my Julia code, I wrote a single function which takes in a type of <code>AbstractClassifier</code>. 
Since I defined both my classifiers to be subtypes of <code>AbstractClassifier</code>, calling score on those objects dispatches to this <code>score</code> function.</p>

<p>Of course you can argue I could have made a super class in Python which implements <code>score</code>, and then have both <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> and <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> inherit from it.
However this adds complexity without much benefit.
In Julia, there is a robust type system and it makes sense to follow those design patterns.</p>

<p>Another use case is with my <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/Utilities.jl#L65"><code>calc_f1_s…</code></a></p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/">Excalidraw project</a>, we have decided to deprecate <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-desktop">Excalidraw Desktop</a>, an <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> wrapper for Excalidraw, in favor of the Web version that you can—and always could—find at <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw.com</a>. After a careful analysis, we have decided that <a href="https://web.dev/pwa/">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA) is the future we want to build upon. Read on to learn more about our rationale.</p>
<!-- end -->
<h2>How Excalidraw Desktop came into being</h2>
<p>Soon after <a href="https://twitter.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a> had created the initial version of Excalidraw in January 2020 and <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/reflections-on-excalidraw/">blogged about it</a>, he proposed the following in <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/561#issue-555138343">Issue #561</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Would be great to wrap Excalidraw within Electron (or equivalent) and publish it as a native application to the various app stores.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The immediate reaction by <a href="https://github.com/voluntadpear">@voluntadpear</a> was to suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What about making it a PWA instead? Android currently supports adding them to the Play Store as Trusted Web Activities and hopefully iOS will do the same soon. On Desktop, Chrome lets you download a desktop shortcut to a PWA.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision that <a href="https://github.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a> took in the end was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We should do both :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While work on converting the version of Excalidraw into a PWA was started by <a href="https://github.com/voluntadpear">@voluntadpear</a> and later others, <a href="https://github.com/lipis">@lipis</a> independently <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/561#issuecomment-579573783">went ahead</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-desktop">separate repo</a> for Excalidraw Desktop.</p>
<p>To this day, the initial goal set by <a href="https://github.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a>, that is, to submit Excalidraw to the various app stores, has not been reached yet. Honestly, no one has even started the submission process to any of the stores. But why is that? Before I try to provide an answer, let me quickly look at Electron, the platform.</p>
<h2>What is Electron?</h2>
<p>The unique selling point of <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> is that it allows you to <em>“build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS”</em>. Apps built with Electron are <em>“compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux”</em>, that is, <em>“Electron apps build and run on three platforms”</em>. According to the homepage, the hard parts that Electron makes easy are <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater">automatic updates</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/menu">native menus and notifications</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/crash-reporter">crash reporting</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/content-tracing">debugging and profiling</a>, and <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater#windows">Windows installers</a>. Turns out, some of the promised features need a detailed look at the small print.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, automatic updates <em>“are [currently] only [supported] on macOS and Windows. There is no built-in support for auto-updater on Linux, so it is recommended to use the distribution’s package manager to update your app”</em>.</li>
<li>Developers can create native menus by calling <code>Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu)</code>. On Windows and Linux, the menu will be set as each window’s top menu, while on macOS there are many system-defined standard menus, like the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/1428608-servicesmenu?language=objc">Services</a> menu. To make one’s menus a standard menu, developers should set their menu’s <code>role</code> accordingly, and Electron will recognize them and make them become standard menus. This means that a lot of menu-related code will make use of the following platform check: <code>const isMac = process.platform === 'darwin'</code>.</li>
<li>Windows installers can be made with <a href="https://github.com/electron/windows-installer">windows-installer</a>. The README of the project highlights that <em>“for a production app you need to sign your application. Internet Explorer’s SmartScreen filter will block your app from being downloaded, and many anti-virus vendors will consider your app as malware unless you obtain a valid cert”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at just these three examples, it is clear that Electron is far from “write once, run everywhere”. Distributing an app on app stores requires <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/code-signing">code signing</a>, a security technology for certifying app ownership. Packaging an app requires using tools like <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge">electron-forge</a> and thinking about where to host packages for app updates. It gets complex relatively quickly, especially when the objective truly is cross platform support. I want to note that it is <em>abolutely</em> possible to create stunning Electron apps with enough effort and dedication. For Excalidraw Desktop, we were not there.</p>
<h2>Where Excalidraw Desktop left off</h2>
<p>Excalidraw Desktop so far is basically the Excalidraw Web app bundled as an <a href="https://github.com/electron/asar"><code>.asar</code></a> file with an added <strong>About Excalidraw</strong> window. The look and feel of the application is almost identical to the Web version.</p>

<p>On macOS, there is now a native menu at the top of the application, but since none of the menu actions—apart from <strong>Close Window</strong> and <strong>About Excalidraw</strong>—are hooked up to to anything, the menu is, in its current state, pretty useless. Meanwhile, all actions can of course be performed via the regular Excalidraw toolbars and the context menu.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder">electron-builder</a>, which supports <a href="https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#PlatformSpecificBuildOptions-fileAssociations">file type associations</a>. By double-clicking an <code>.excalidraw</code> file, ideally the Excalidraw Desktop app should open. The relevant excerpt of our <code>electron-builder.json</code> file looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"fileAssociations"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"ext"</span><span>:</span> <span>"excalidraw"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Excalidraw"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Excalidraw file"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"role"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Editor"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"mimeType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"application/json"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, this does not always work as intended, since, depending on the installation type (for the current user, for all users), apps on Windows&nbsp;10 do not have the rights to associate a file type to themselves.</p>
<p>These shortcomings and the pending work to make the experience truly native-like on <em>all</em> platforms (which, again, with enough effort <em>is</em> possible) were a strong argument for us to reconsider our investment in Excalidraw Desktop. The way bigger argument for us, though, was that we foresee that for <em>our</em> use case, we do not need all the features Electron offers. The grown and still growing set of capabilities of the Web serves us equally well, if not better.</p>
<h2>How the Web serves us today and in the future</h2>
<p>Even in 2020, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is still <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/javascript#libraries">incredibly popular</a>. For many developers it has become a habit to use it, despite the fact that today they <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">might not need jQuery</a>. There is a similar resource for Electron, aptly called <a href="https://youmightnotneedelectron.com/">You Might Not Need Electron</a>. Let me outline in the following why we think we do not need Electron.</p>
<h3>Installable Progressive Web App</h3>
<p>Excalidraw today is an <a href="https://web.dev/installable/">installable</a> Progressive Web App with a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/service-worker.js">service worker</a> and a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/manifest.json">Web App Manifest</a>. It caches all its resources in two caches, one for fonts and font-related CSS, and one for everything else.</p>

<p>Excalidraw is configured to run as a standalone application, so when you install it, you get an app that runs in its own window. It is fully integrated in the operating system’s multitasking UI and gets its own app icon on the home screen, Dock, or task bar; depending on what platform you install it.</p>

<h3>File system access</h3>
<p>Excalidraw makes use of <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/browser-nativefs">browser-nativefs</a> for accessing the file system of the operating system. On supporting browsers, this allows for a true open→edit→save workflow and actual over-saving and “save as”, with a transparent fallback for other browsers. You can learn more about this feature in my blog post <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/browser-nativefs/">Reading and writing files and directories with the browser-nativefs library</a>.</p>
<h3>Drag and drop support</h3>
<p>Files can be dragged and dropped onto the Excalidraw window just as in native applications. On a browser that supports the <a href="https://web.dev/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a>, a dropped file can be immediately edited and the modifications be saved to the original file. This is so intuitive that you sometimes forget that you are dealing with a Web app.</p>
<h3>Clipboard access</h3>
<p>Excalidraw works well with the operating system’s clipboard. Entire Excalidraw drawings or also just individual objects can be copied and pasted in <code>image/png</code> and <code>image/svg+xml</code> formats, allowing for an easy integration with other native tools like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> or Web-based tools like <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a>.</p>

  </a>
    </span>
  <figcaption>The Excalidraw context menu offering clipboard actions</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>File handling</h3>
<p>Excalidraw already supports the experimental <a href="https://web.dev/file-handling/">File Handling API</a>, which means <code>.excalidraw</code> files can be double-clicked in the operating system’s file manager and open directly in the Excalidraw app, since Excalidraw registers as a file handler for <code>.excalidraw</code> files in the operating system.</p>
<h3>Declarative link capturing</h3>
<p>Excalidraw drawings can be shared by link—here is an <a href="https://excalidraw.com/#json=4646308765761536,jwZJW8JsOM75vdhqG2nBgA">example</a>. In the future, if people have Excalidraw installed as a PWA, such links will not open in a browser tab, but launch a new standalone window. This will work thanks to <a href="https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch/blob/master/declarative_link_capturing.md">declarative link capturing</a>, an, at the time of writing, bleeding-edge proposal for a new Web platform feature.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Web has come a long way, with more and more features landing in browsers that only a couple of years or even months ago were unthinkable on the Web and exclusive to native applications. Excalidraw is at the forefront of what is possible in the browser, all while acknowledging that not all browsers on all platforms support each feature we make use of. By betting on a progressive enhancement strategy, we enjoy the latest and greatest wherever possible, but without leaving anyone behind. Best viewed in <em>any</em> browser.</p>
<p>Electron has served us well, but in 2020 and beyond, we can live without it. Oh, and for that objective of <a href="https://github/com/vjeux">@vjeux</a>: since the Android Play Store now accepts PWAs in a container format called <a href="https://web.dev/using-a-pwa-in-your-android-app/">Trusted Web Activity</a> and since the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-edgehtml/microsoft-store">Microsoft Store supports PWAs</a>, too, you can expect Excalidraw in these stores in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, you can always use and install <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw in and from the browser</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

But they damage the business in the long run.</p><p>Facebook is a prime example of tricking users into sharing personal information when they assume the default settings are meant to guard their privacy. There’s even a dark pattern with its CEO’s namesake: “<a href="https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering.html">privacy zuckering</a>.”</p><p>But the default effect can also be used for good intent.</p><p>For example, in Germany you have to opt-in to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation">organ donation</a> – the default option is to be opted out. The consent rate is a meager 12%. Across the border in Austria however, the default effect works in your favor. There you’re opted in per default. The consent rate is a proud 99%.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/california-law-will-automatically-register-drivers-to-vote.html">“motor voter” law in California</a> was passed. It automatically registers new drivers to vote unless they opt out, thus nudging millions of Californians towards their civic responsibility.</p><h2>How Changing Defaults Would Save Energy</h2><p>Whenever data is stored on servers, transferred over telecommunications networks or processed on end user devices, the electronics involved consume electricity. The energy consumption of the internet may have already surpassed that of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">airline industry</a> and is more than <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/global-warming-data-centres-consume-three-times-much-energy-next-decade-experts-warn-a6830086.html">1 ⅓ times that of the UK</a> as a whole.</p><p>So by reducing the amount of data we store, transfer or process, we reduce the energy needed. Less coal, biofuels or atom rods need to be burned, fewer windmills need to turn, fewer solar panels need to operate.</p><p>So us tech workers need to ask ourselves</p><blockquote><p>Does the default option or standard use the least amount of energy possible?</p></blockquote><h2>Low Power Mode in Devices Per Default</h2><p>When your iPhone is running low on juice, it’ll ask you to turn on low-power mode. Doing so stops automatic mail fetching and background app refreshing and reduces some visual effects. But why wait until you’re running for the next outlet?</p><p>You could, of course, set up an <a href="https://medium.com/macoclock/turn-on-low-power-mode-at-any-ios14-trick-6f5cfcb3b3cd">automation to enable Low Power Mode</a> at any battery level. But that’s more of a thing for <em>power users</em> (excuse the pun 🙃).</p><p>A greener alternative for the masses would be to have low-power mode enabled by default. The system could ask whether to turn on “High Power Mode” for tasks that need it.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-dialog-low-power-mode.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Ask to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery's already low.</figcaption></figure><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-dialog-high-power-mode.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Have Low Power Mode on by default – and ask for more power only when it's needed.</figcaption></figure><p>The Mac’s energy settings are a bit complicated. There have been calls for a simpler <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/15/call-for-low-power-mode-for-macs/">iPhone-style Low Power Mode on MacBooks</a>.</p><p>Also, do Siri and Alexa really need to burn the candle at both ends, constantly waiting on your beckon call and sipping electricity throughout the night? They should just go to sleep when you do, maybe suggesting their own sleep times based on your latest/earliest interactions.</p><h2>Reduce web data with the “pull” principle</h2><p>Reducing the number of bytes you send to users not only corresponds to a smaller carbon footprint, it also means content loads faster, thus leading to happier users and better business metrics. So just how much web data are we talking about?</p><p>The <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight?start=2020_01_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list">HTTP Archive</a> reports on the page weight of millions of websites.</p><p>I took a look at the latest median (p50) transfer sizes of the following data types and have ranked them from smallest to largest:</p><p>Median data transfer in kilobytes by type<br>(p50, October 2020)</p><p><span>Desktop</span><span>Mobile</span></p><dl><dt>HTML</dt><dd><span>25.8</span></dd><dd><span>24.1</span></dd><dt>CSS</dt><dd><span>72.7</span></dd><dd><span>66.9</span></dd><dt>Fonts</dt><dd><span>131.4</span></dd><dd><span>111.1</span></dd><dt>JavaScript</dt><dd><span>451.7</span></dd><dd><span>412.5</span></dd><dt>Images</dt><dd><span>973.4</span></dd><dd><span>902.9</span></dd><dt>Video</dt><dd><span>1538.2</span></dd><dd><span>1867.9</span></dd></dl><p>We see that in terms of the number of bytes flying around the web, <strong>videos, images and JavaScript are the biggest energy hogs</strong>.</p><p>The best way to reduce the amount of data on the web: avoiding transferring it to the user altogether until she actively requests, or <em>pulls</em>, it from the web via interaction (e.g button click) or navigation (e.g. lazy loading).</p><p>Here are some examples.</p><h3>Don’t auto-play videos</h3><p>Videos are by far the biggest offenders when it comes to putting the Internet on an energy diet.</p><p>And video chat and entertainment have exploded due to Corona. Video chat apparently has a much <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">lower impact than meeting in person</a>. I’d love to find similar comparisons between the home theater and the one that smells of overpriced popcorn and soft drinks.</p><p>Still, the point I’m trying to make in this post is: we still need to be aware of the cost of our data use and design system defaults to use minimal energy.</p><p>For example, Netflix makes it so easy for users to binge watch entire series. Not only do they provide stellar content, they auto-play it too.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-autoplay-1.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Auto-play the next 45 minutes of your life.</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blr.design/img//green-by-default-autoplay-2.svg"><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Add a bit of friction when it comes to data consumption.</figcaption></figure><p>By having auto-play off by default, the user would have to actively play the next video. And while that might not help you right after watching a cliffhanger, it provides just a bit of friction to avoid more data transfer.</p><p>Another way streaming sites could be green by default: saving videos locally for a period of time. My child, for example, loves watching a certain show. Instead of pulling the videos from Netflix servers each time she views them, the app could just play them from the local cache if requested within a week or two. That would require quite a bit of storage on my device – but that’s not really a problem.</p><p>If you use video on your site, think about using the default effect to limit data use: you can make sure videos don’t auto-play. Or better yet: use a placeholder for the video embed and don’t load any video player or YouTube scripts until the user clicks on it.</p><h3>Don’t auto-load images</h3><p>The best way to reduce the amount of image data on the web is by using text instead – or CSS or SVGs for graphics, which are basically text-based.</p><p>On the clothing brand <a href="https://lowimpact.organicbasics.com/gbp">Organic Basics</a>’s low-impact website, they don’t shove megabytes worth of product images onto customers’ devices like other shops usually do. Instead they apply the “pull principle” very effectively – and very in-line with an ethical brand – by only showing simple SVG silhouettes by default. If the grid is currently green enough, the user can decide to click on a silhouette to load a real product image, like so:</p><div><figure><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 341 453"><defs></defs><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path fill="#131415" d="M2.3 2.3H337v449.2H2.3z"></path><path stroke="#979797" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="3" d="M126.6 186.6c2.9-2.2 5.6-4.6 8.6-6.5 10-6.4 29 5.5 10.8 8.5-4.4.7-8.8 1.1-13.2.6-1.9-.2-3.3-2-5-2.9M88.5 184.4c-1 1.3-1.8 2.8-3 3.9-18 15.4-10.5-17.6 4.4-6.1M73 279.1c32 2.4 46.2 4.5 72.2-15.7 4.4-3.4 13.1-11.8 14.9-18 1.1-4-1.1-14.1 2.7-12.3 4.5 2.2 2 9.8 2.4 14.7.4 7.2.9 15.7-3.9 21.8-13.8 17.7-36 23.8-58.1 24.6-13.2.4-23.7-.2-31.3-10.6M118.7 319c-6.8 7-12.3 10.8-15.2 20.7-1.1 4-.8 8.2-.8 12.3 0 31.2 17.6 25.6 42 21 10.6-1.9 21.1-3.6 31.6-5.1 14.4-2.1 15-1.7 29-2M169.3 115.3c0-9-.3-3.6 4-20.1 8.2-32.4 12.5-51.9 25.2-80.2M160.3 374.7a715.4 715.4 0 00179-9.3M128.9 378.9c16.2 15.7 23.5 25.7 42.9 40.4.9.6 2 1 3 1.3 3.9 1 7.8 1.7 11.8 2.2a680 680 0 0038.8 3.5c87 4.8 45.4-1.7 81 4.2"></path><path stroke="#979797" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="3" d="M108.3 372.1c-.2 12.5 1.1 25-.4 37.4-.2 1.3-3.2-1.3-4.2-.4l-2.5 1.5c-3.3 3-6.4 6.2-9.3 9.6-7.3 8.7-11.4 19.6-8.5 30.6M96 378.1c-12 10.1-39.1 28.3-41 47-.6 6.3-.7 12.6-1 19M176.8 2.3c-52 129.5 1.2 2.8-26.3 59.3-.4.8-.2 1.7 0 2.6l4.1 11.2c1.6 6-1.2 7-3 13.3-1.8 6.8-3.2 13.8-4.8 20.6M72.7 316.7c-4.4 16.8-7.9 33.8-13.1 50.3-2.5 8-3.8 17.3-10 22.9-6.4 5.7-16.4 4.7-24.2 8-8.2 3.3-16 7.8-23.8 11.7M188 125.7c-25.1-9-55.9-11.3-77.8 9.3-44.1 41.7-13 15.6-33.8 32.7M74.3 180.2c-1.3 13.4-1.1 18.7-7.4 33-4.3 9.9-13 15-11.2 26.8 1.2 8 3.1 15.8 4.3 23.8 2.6 16.3 2.4 30.7 13.5 43.8 2.7 3.3 11.8 5.2 14.3 5.8 19.8 4.7 34.9-.3 54-6 11.1-3.3 25.7-6 36.9-10.7 32.3-13.6 51.6-46.9 58-79.8 3-15.6 1-24.2-2.8-39.1-6.9-26.2-6.8-27.7-28.8-41.6-5.3-3.4-10.3-10.4-17.3-9.6M287.6 3c-1.6 39-2.9 78-4.7 116.9-.2 4.7-.6 9.4-1.4 14-1.8 10.2-5.5 20.1-6.5 30.5-1 9.3 1 18.7.7 28-.4 16.7-2 33.3-2.5 50-.5 12.6 0 25.3-.5 37.9-1 23.2-4.3 26.3-7.2 53.4-1.3 12.3.8 21.8 2.3 34"></path><text fill="#FFF" font-family="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT, Times New Roman" font-size="18" font-weight="bold" letter-spacing="-.1" transform="translate(1 2)"><tspan x="125.9" y="330.7">Click to see</tspan><tspan x="117.5" y="350.7">who’s smiling</tspan></text></g></svg><picture><source sizes="auto" data-srcset="/img/ja-san-miguel-_-QQuvAwQ-0-unsplash.webp" type="image/webp"><img data-src="/img/ja-san-miguel-_-QQuvAwQ-0-unsplash.jpg" src="https://blr.design/img/ja-san-miguel-_-QQuvAwQ-0-unsplash.jpg"></picture><figcaption>Click on the placeholder image (1.1 KB) to load the real image (23 - 65 KB, depending on browser)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The next best way to minimize image data is by not loading images until the user scrolls to then (i.e. lazy loading). For performance reasons however, any above-the-fold images should load ASAP.

The latter are used for front-end analytics, serving and tracking ads, social media, etc. Third-party JavaScript is especially critical, since its use has <a href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/javascript-growth/">grown disproportionately</a> to first-party JavaScript and due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Data protection regulations such as the GDPR in Europe and the CDPA in California are a good example of designing data-poor defaults.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s still a grey area where some website owners try to stuff as many trackers into the category of cookies that are “necessary” for operation so they load with or without consent.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-cookie-1.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Make it difficult for users to reject cookies, trackers and technologies that generate more data.</figcaption></figure><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-cookie-2.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Keep your 3rd-party usage down to a minimum, use tools that also have an apparent benefit to users, and give users an honest and fair choice to opt in/out.</figcaption></figure><p>Many also use shady dark patterns in their cookie-consent layers, hiding “reject all” buttons. And since people tend to go with default options, they often unknowingly allow tracker data to load.</p><h3>System fonts per default</h3><p>Fonts are another contributor to page weight, with a median of 100+ KB. By sticking to system fonts by default, you can reduce the amount of font data to zero.</p><p>Sure, I love beautiful typography, and if the web only used the same system fonts, everything would look cookie-cutter.</p><p>Still, you can keep page weight down by default by offering the user custom fonts as a secondary option.

December 17, 2020 | https://unop.uk/dotnet-5-self-contained-single-file-apps-linux/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://unop.uk/dotnet-5-self-contained-single-file-apps-linux/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            

<p>.NET 5 is out <a href="https://unop.uk/dotnet-core-3-0-and-dotnet-5-0">on schedule</a> (but with a reduced scope).
The Core branding has gone but it’s the same modern cross-platform codebase and not the old Windows-only Framework.</p>

<p>I’m normally a <abbr title="Long Term Support">LTS</abbr> person (I only upgraded from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to 20.04 LTS recently, now that 20.10 is out).
As you become an experienced engineer you learn to value LTS and stop chasing the latest JavaScript framework of the week.
Most of my projects (for example, <a href="https://unop.uk/huxley-2-release/">Huxley 2</a>) will stay on 3.1 LTS until at least next year when .NET 6 LTS comes out.</p>

<p>However, there is one feature of .NET 5 that is quite interesting and I wanted to try out.
This feature is self-contained <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0/#single-file-applications">single file apps</a> and it is only available on Linux (not on mac or Windows, yet).
This is another area where Linux is a step ahead.</p>

<h2 id="octoplot">OctoPlot</h2>

<p>I’ve upgraded my <a href="https://unop.uk/octoplot-visualise-paid-energy-use-in-your-terminal/">OctoPlot</a> tool to .NET 5 and produced some self-contained single file app Linux binaries. You can stay on 3.1 and use the 5.0 SDK but the binaries are bigger. I also trimmed out any unused code from the assemblies (including <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run">R2R</a>, which is not the same AOT compilation as CoreRT or .NET Native) to get them as small as possible.</p>

<p>The result is a binary under 5MB compressed. This is by no means tiny compared to a Python script but it includes the runtime, making it easy to deploy. This is about a quarter of the size of the previous release artefacts.</p>

<p>If you want to see the results in action then you can <code>wget</code> (or <code>curl</code>) a binary from <a href="https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/1.0.1">the GitHub release</a>.
For example, on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (e.g. a <a href="https://unop.uk/pi-hole-extended-part-2/">pi hole</a>) use the following commands (replace <code>arm</code> with <code>x64</code> or <code>arm64</code> as appropriate).</p>

<p>Download with <code>wget</code> (upper case <code>O</code>):</p>

<pre><code>wget -O octoplot.xz https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/download/1.0.1/octoplot-linux-arm.xz
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you prefer <code>curl</code> (lower case <code>o</code>):</p>

<pre><code>curl -L -o octoplot.xz https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/download/1.0.1/octoplot-linux-arm.xz
</code></pre>

<p><code>-L</code> is required to follow the GitHub redirect to AWS S3.</p>

<p>Then decompress the binary, make it executable and run it.</p>

<pre><code>xz -d octoplot.xz
chmod +x octoplot
./octoplot j
</code></pre>

<p>You should specify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_network_operator#History">region ID character</a> for the area you are interested in.
E.g. <code>j</code> for South East England, the default value is <code>p</code> (North Scotland).
Add it to your <code>PATH</code> if you want to run <code>octoplot</code> from anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>If you want to build it for yourself then you can install .NET 5 with your usual <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#2004-">package manager</a>.
Before you start using it you may want to disable the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry">telemetry</a> that is on by default.
You can do this in many places, e.g. <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
</code></pre>

<p>Or in <code>/etc/environment</code> (no need for the <code>export</code> command here) for wider reach:</p>

<pre><code>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
</code></pre>

<p>You can also alter your <code>PATH</code> here.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I use my <code>octoplot</code> tool to help me plan when the cheapest time will be to run appliances.
For example, when to set the timer on the oven for to be paid for it to pyrolytic auto-clean.</p>

<p>Our latest Agile bill from Octopus Energy put the average cost per kWh at about 8p, which is roughly half-price compared to fixed tariffs. This would save us over £300 a year if it continues.</p>

<p>You can use my <a href="https://unop.uk/octoyosu-agile-tariff-comparison-tool/">Octoyosu</a> tool to see how much you could save.
If you want to switch then you can thank me (and save £50) by using <a href="https://share.octopus.energy/witty-wave-889">this referral link</a>.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary (pun intended) as we have an <a href="https://unop.uk/ev-reading/">EV</a> (a second hand Leaf) that I typically charge overnight at weekends.
I’ll save a follow-up review after a few more months of ownership for a future post but in summary it’s best car I’ve ever driven. It’s so much fun to drive and outrageously cheap to run but it still hasn’t stopped me from walking to the shops.</p>

<p>It’s not just about cost and it’s important to reduce usage too. I don’t want to be part of the problem.</p>

<p>I’ve finished reading Clearing the Air: The Beginning and the End of Air Pollution by Tim Smedley, which is excellent and well worth a read. Although EVs produce no exhaust emissions and produce less from brake wear, they still re-suspend pollution on the road produced by fossil cars. Sitting in traffic is the worst place to be from an exposure perspective, plus there’s the obvious additional negative health implications from lack of exercise.</p>

<p>Speaking of exercise, last weekend (as a lockdown project) I lagged the loft with insulation made from recycled glass, improving what was there already.
As autumn leaves (fall) and winter arrives, this should help reduce our energy usage when the freezing temperatures come in December. It helped that I’m used to wearing a face mask now!</p>

Recently someone opened up an <a href="https://github.com/elixir-gettext">issue on Gettext</a> saying compilation of Gettext modules got slower in Erlang/OTP 23. In this article, we are going to explore how I have debugged this problem and the three separate pull requests sent to the Erlang/OTP repository to improve compiler performance.</p>
<p>
For those not familar, the Gettext project converts <code>.po</code> files like this:</p>
<pre><code># pt
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Olá mundo"

# pl
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Witaj świecie"</code></pre>
<p>
Into a module with functions:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">(</span><span>"pt"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Olá mundo"</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">(</span><span>"pl"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Witaj świecie"</span></code></pre>
<p>
While we start with an Elixir application, we end-up doing most of the work with the Erlang compiler and tools, so most of the lessons here are applicable to the wider ecosystem. Be sure to read until the end for a welcome surprise.</p>
<h2>
Isolating the slow file</h2>
<p>
When project compilation is slow, the first step is to identify which files are slow. In Elixir v1.11, this can be done like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile --force --profile time</code></pre>
<p>
The command above will print:</p>
<pre><code>...
[profile] lib/ecto/query/planner.ex compiled in 1376ms (plus 596ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/association.ex compiled in 904ms (plus 1168ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/changeset.ex compiled in 869ms (plus 1301ms waiting)
[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
Compilation of each file in your project is done in parallel. The overall message is:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] FILE compiled in COMPILE_TIME (plus WAITING_TIME waiting)</code></pre>
<p>
<code>COMPILE_TIME</code> is the time we were effectively compiling code. However, since a file may depend on a module defined in another file, <code>WAITING_TIME</code> is the time we wait until the file we depend on becomes available. High waiting times are not usually a concern, so we focus on the files with high compilation times.</p>
<p>
At the end, we print two summaries:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
The first includes the time to compile all files in parallel and includes how many modules have been defined. The second is the time to execute a group pass which looks at all modules at once, in order to find undefined functions, emit deprecations, etc.</p>
<p>
Unless the “group pass check” is the slow one - which would be a bug in the Elixir compiler - we are often looking at a single file being the root cause of slow compilation. With this file in hand, it is time to dig deeper.</p>
<h2>
Timing the slow file</h2>
<p>
Once we have identified the slow file, we need to understand why it is slow. When Elixir compiles a file, it executes code at three distinct stages. For example, let’s assume the slow down was in <code>lib/problematic_file.ex</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span># FILE LEVEL</span><span>
</span><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>ProblematicModule</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span># MODULE LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span># FUNCTION LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
When compiling the file above, Elixir will execute each level in order. If that file has multiple modules, then compilation will happen for each module in the file, first at MODULE LEVEL and then FUNCTION LEVEL.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
TIP: If a file with multiple modules is slow, I suggest breaking those modules into separate files and repeating the steps in the previous section.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With this knowledge in hand, we want to compile the file once again, but now passing the <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> flag to the underlying Erlang compiler, which will print time reports. One option is to do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile
$ touch lib/problematic_file.ex
$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code></pre>
<p>
Then, for each module being compiled (which includes the one in your <code>mix.exs</code>), you will see a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core             :  0.653 s   72136.4 kB
sys_core_fold    :  0.482 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_alias   :  0.146 s   69055.3 kB
core_transforms  :  0.000 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_bsm     :  0.098 s   69055.3 kB
v3_kernel        :  2.250 s  169439.0 kB</code></pre>
<p>
Most compilers work by doing multiple passes on your code. Above we can see how much time was spent on each pass and how much memory the code representation, also known as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), takes after each pass.</p>
<p>
The <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code> command above has one issue though. If other files depend on the problematic file, they may be recompiled too, and that will add noise to your output. If that’s the case, you can also do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix run lib/problematic_file.ex</code></pre>
<p>
This is a rather neat trick: we are re-running a file that we have just compiled. You will get warnings about modules being redefined but they are safe to ignore.</p>
<p>
With the time reports in hand, there are two possible scenarios here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
One (or several) of the passes in the report are slow. This means the slow down happens when compiling at the FUNCTION LEVEL and it will be associated with the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file for <code>ProblematicModule</code>    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
All passes are fast and the slow down happens before the reports emitted by <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> are printed. If this is the case, the slowdown is actually happening at the MODULE LEVEL, before the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Most times, the slowdown is actually at the FUNCTION LEVEL, including the one reported as a Gettext issue, so that’s the one we will explore. Performance issues at the MODULE LEVEL may still happen though, especially in large module bodies as seen in Phoenix’s Router - but don’t worry, those have often already been optimized throughout the years!</p>
<h2>
Moving to Erlang</h2>
<p>
At this point, we have found a module that is slow to compile. Given the original Gettext issue pointed to a difference of performance between Erlang versions, my next step is to remove Elixir from the equation.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this is very easy to do with the <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/decompile">decompile</a> project:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix archive.install github michalmuskala/decompile
$ mix decompile ProblematicModule --to erl</code></pre>
<p>
This command will emit a <code>Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code> file, which is literally the compiled Elixir code, represented in Erlang. Now, let’s compile it again, but without involving Elixir at all:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>
TIP: the command above may not work out of the box. That’s because the <code>.erl</code> file generated by <code>decompile</code> may have invalid syntax. In those cases, you can manually fix those errors. They are often small nits.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to try it yourself, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/josevalim/694c1799143fcf25e43aa27e3e11e4c1">find the <code>.erl</code> file for the Gettext report here</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.GettextCompile.Gettext.erl</code></pre>
<p>
Here are the relevant snippets of the report I got on my machine:</p>
<pre><code>...
expand_records         :      0.065 s   19988.0 kB
core                   :      3.295 s  373293.3 kB
...
beam_ssa_bool          :      1.125 s   39252.7 kB
...
beam_ssa_bsm           :      2.432 s   39263.1 kB
   ...
beam_ssa_funs          :      0.119 s   39263.1 kB
beam_ssa_opt           :      6.242 s   39298.0 kB
   ...
...
beam_ssa_pre_codegen   :      3.426 s   48897.5 kB
   ...
...</code></pre>
<p>
Looking at the report you can start building an intuition about which passes are slow. Given we were also told the code compiled fast on Erlang/OTP 22.3, I compiled the same file with that Erlang version and compared the reports side by side. Here are my notes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>core</code> pass got considerably slower between Erlang/OTP versions (from 1.8s to 3.2s)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Going from the <code>expand_records</code> pass to <code>core</code> increases the memory usage by almost 20 times (although this behaviour was also there on Erlang/OTP 22)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>beam_ssa_bool</code> did not exist on Erlang/OTP 22    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
In Erlang/OTP 22.3, the module takes 22 seconds to compile. On version 23.1, it takes 32 seconds. We have some notes and a reasonable target of 22 seconds to optimize towards. Let’s get to work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Note: it is worth saying that it is very natural for new passes to be added and others to be removed between Erlang/OTP versions, precisely because the compiler is getting smarter all the time! As part of this process, some passes get faster and others get slower. Such is life. :)  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Pull request #1: the profiler option</h2>
<p>
The Erlang compiler also has a neat feature that alows us to profile any compiler pass. Since we have detected the slow down in the <code>core</code> file, let’s profile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +'{eprof, core}' Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<p>
It will print a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core: Running eprof

****** Process &lt;0.111.0&gt;    -- 100.00 % of profiled time ***
FUNCTION                   CALLS        %      TIME  [uS / CALLS]
--------                   -----  -------      ----  [----------]
gen:do_for_proc/2              1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
gen:'-call/4-fun-0-'/4         1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:unforce/2              2     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:make_bool_switch/5     2     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:expr_map/4             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:safe_map/2             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]</code></pre>
<p>
With the slowest entries coming at the bottom. In this Gettext module, the slowest entry was:</p>
<pre><code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4     3220377    19.14   2447684  [      0.76]</code></pre>
<p>
Jackpot! 20% of the compilation time was spent on a single function. This is a great opportunity for optimization.</p>
<p>
I usually like to say there are two types of performance improvements. You have semantic improvements, which you can only pull off by having a grasp of the domain. The more you understand, the more likely you are to be able to come up with an improved algorithm (or the more you will be certain you are already implementing the state of the art). There are also mechanical improvements, which are more about how the runtime and the data structures in the language work. Often you work with a mixture of both.</p>
<p>
In this case, the function <code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4</code> is a function that traverses all AST nodes recursively. You can also see it was called more than 3 million times. The <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/db13f8883721c7a217a80cb2c73a1e419f462d83/lib/compiler/src/v3_core.erl#L3040">caller of this function in the <code>core</code> pass has the following goal</a>:</p>

<p>One essential question for every potential book author is: <strong>What does it financially cost to write a book?</strong> Obviously, there is no universal answer to this. Furthermore, in most cases, the goal is to not only cover the cost, but also to earn additional money. In any case, it is important to know what the financial cost of a book project is. Only then, one can decide whether it is worth to do it.</p>

<p>This article explains how to calculate the financial cost of writing a book. The relevant components of a potential calculation are described and illustrated with an example. As final outcome, a formula is presented that incorporates all the described parts. Naturally, the specific cost for a book depends on many factors. Therefore, this article is best to be seen as inspiration for a more specific and detailed calculation.</p>

<h2 id="context-and-example">Context and example</h2>

<p>For the context of the following calculation, it is assumed that the only involved person is an author. This means, there are no co-authors, editors or reviewers. Also, the book is assumed to be self-published as e-book via a publishing platform, such as <a href="https://leanpub.com/">Leanpub</a>. Therefore, there are no costs associated with the selling process.</p>

<p>As example, I am using my own publication <a href="https://leanpub.com/implementing-ddd-cqrs-and-event-sourcing">“Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing”</a>. This is the first book I have written and published. The book was a side project for almost exactly four years. One thing I have learned from it is the importance of being honest about the financial aspects. While writing a book has numerous beneficial effects, the most common primary goal is to earn money.</p>

<h2 id="financial-investment">Financial investment</h2>

<p>Writing a book is comparable to a financial investment. Instead of directly investing money, one has to invest time. This may sound appealing at first, but the time spent on a book reduces the time spent earning money. Every invested minute potentially causes a financial loss at first. This demands the existence of savings or an additional source of income. Writing a book either requires money to live off or additional time to earn money to live off.</p>

<h2 id="working-time">Working time</h2>

<p>The first component for a cost calculation is the working time. This is also the most difficult value, as it is unknown at the beginning of a project. Ideally, it can be estimated based on prior experience. Instead of a fixed value, it is helpful to define a range between an optimistic and a pessimistic estimation. While it is hard to predict the time initially, the value can be tracked continuously and estimations can be refined.</p>

<p>For my own book, I did not perform any realistic estimation. Rather, I only defined arbitrary points in time when I intended to be finished. Needless to say, these intentional release dates were always incorrect. While I performed detailed time tracking, I only did so for 75% of the time. Consequently, I have no tracking data for the first year. The tracking taught me that the numbers can be really useful, but detailed descriptions are not required.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I invested around 1894 hours in working on my book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total time I tracked for my book is 1579 hours. For the missing first year, the hours can be estimated using the history of my git repository. In the three years during which I performed tracking, there were 1092 commits. This makes an average of 1.45 hours per commit. In the first year, there were 217 commits. Based on the commit-hour ratio, this makes 315 additional hours. In total, I invested around 1894 hours in working on my book.</p>

<h3 id="hours-compared-to-time">Hours compared to time</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>One year full-time work with 9 hours per day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, it is hard to tell how hours relate to a time span. For the book context, it can help to translate a full-time job to hours. One year has 52 weeks and therefore 260 workdays. Assume that an average person has 30 paid holidays, 10 paid sick days and 5 public holidays. After subtracting these values, this leaves 215 days. Based on that, my invested hours are equivalent to one year full-time work with almost 9 hours per day.</p>

<h2 id="cost-of-work">Cost of work</h2>

<p>The second calculation component is the cost of work. This part can be specified as hourly rate. For self-employed workers, it is the same rate one would charge for client projects. For employed people, determining the correct value is more difficult. One has to account for paid vacation, paid sick leave, bank holidays, employer contributions to insurances, work equipment, etc. In fact, it should be more productive to determine the rate a freelancer would get for the same job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Book cost = Hours * Rate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my own book, I can calculate the hourly rate based on what I charged for clients. In the first two years, my rate was 85 Euro. In the third year, it was 90 Euro. Finally, in the fourth year, the rate was 92 Euro. For a correct average, the values must be weighted using the invested hours per year. The resulting average hourly rate is 88.6 Euro. Therefore, the base book cost is 167,808 Euro (or 204,726 USD).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1894 hours * 88.6 Euro / hour = 167,808 Euro (or 204,726 USD)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perks-discount">Perks discount</h2>

<p>In terms of qualities and benefits, working on a book is often not the same as paid work. Many times, it is a matter of passion and should be more satisfying in the long run. Also, a personal work schedule is typically more flexible. Furthermore, writing a book is an experience with many beneficial effects, such as improving language skills or deepening specific knowledge. For such perks, it can make sense to discount the assumed cost of work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Book costs = Hours * Rate * Perks discount</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, my experience with writing a book was positive. For one, my language and writing skills improved drastically. Also, the way of processing thoughts and tackling problems changed for the better. On top of that, I became proficient in DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing. However, the work was sometimes frustrating and energy-consuming. In terms to payment, I would be satisfied with 75% of the money I could have earned otherwise. This reduces the book cost to 125,856 Euro (or 153,544 USD).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>167,808 Euro - 25% discount = 125,856 Euro (or 153,544 USD)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="rate-of-return">Rate of return</h2>

<p>Financial investments should yield a return of income. Money is invested with the expectation that a higher amount is returned. The rate of return depends on various factors. One of them is the risk of losing the invested money. Interestingly, the <a href="https://leanpub.com/manifesto">Leanpub Manifesto</a> describes a book as “a risky, highly creative endeavor undertaken by a small team, with low probability of success”. This statement implies that one should calculate with a high rate of return for a book project.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Book costs = Hours * Rate * Perks discount * Return rate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my own book, I do not include a return rate in the original cost calculation. One reason is that I am not experienced with financial investments. Therefore, it is unlikely I would have invested the money if it had been available to me. Also, the idea of including a return rate seems diametrical to the perks discount. In the end, I am willing to accept less money than I could have earned because of the previously described benefits.</p>

<h2 id="time-for-marketing">Time for marketing</h2>

<p>Selling a book requires to invest time or money into marketing, just like with any other product. The marketing part reminds of a phrase I heard once: “Just because you build a website, it will not get visited.”. While writing a book is the specific work, marketing is the necessary activity for selling it. This article assumes that the book author is also doing the marketing, but only by investing time. Financial costs for marketing-related products are not considered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marketing costs = Hours * Rate * Perks discount * Return rate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my own book, I am doing the marketing myself. While I have limited experience in this field, it is a great opportunity for learning. As for the required time, I cannot make reliable predictions. Rather, I opt for a value that seems reasonable to me. I assume that 200 hours of marketing work should provide a good result. For the calculation, the same perks discount is applied. This makes an estimated marketing cost of 13,290 Euro (or 16,214 USD).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(200 hours * 88.6 Euro / hour) - 25% discount = 13,290 Euro (or 16,214 USD)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>The individual components described in the previous sections can be combined into a single formula. Altogether, the cost is the invested time multiplied by the working rate, a potential discount and an expected return rate. As mentioned previously, this naive approach should be used as inspiration for a more detailed calculation. There are many factors that can influence the financial cost of writing a book. Nevertheless, this guidance can serve as a useful starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Book costs = Invested hours * Rate * Perks discount * Return rate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my book <a href="https://leanpub.com/implementing-ddd-cqrs-and-event-sourcing">“Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing”</a>, the overall calculation is as follows: (1894 hours + 200 hours) * 88.6 Euro / hour - 25% discount = 139,146 Euro. This means, the financial cost of writing and initially marketing the book is 139,146 Euro (or 169,758 USD). Further, it implies that only after earning this much money , each sold unit is actual profit. However, any additionally invested time again produces costs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The financial cost of writing and marketing my book is 139,146 Euro (or 169,758 USD).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="after-all-time-is-money">After all, time is money</h2>

<p>Writing a book seems financially appealing, as it “only” requires a time investment. While this is true for most cases, the amount of time needed can be quite large. Also, the chances of success can be rather low, depending on the market. Despite the numerous beneficial effects, it should be well thought through from a financial viewpoint.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Major feature changes have successfully pushed Lambda workloads into the mainstream, even if FaaS purists feel betrayed</em></p><p>Is serverless winning?</p><p>If you ask AWS, they’ll say <em>definitely</em>. Nearly half of all new applications built inside Amazon this year are <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/30/exclusive-aws-chief-andy-jassy-wakeup-call-cloud-adoption/">running on Lambda</a>. Andy Jassy took time in his re:Invent keynote to call out the thousands of enterprises who now run Lambda workloads in production, but perhaps most interesting was that this year the new serverless feature announcements graduated to Jassy’s keynote — a spot usually reserved for the flashiest, most strategic reveals of the year. AWS, at least, clearly believes that serverless is now one of the primary selling points for its cloud.</p><p>(On the other hand, there’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/adoption-of-aws-lambda-serverless-stalls/">this odd article</a>, which spends most of its length demonstrating FaaS growth, but ran under the headline “Serverless Adoption Stalls” because … Kubernetes teams say they aren’t using as much Lambda? In other news, cats report eating fewer vegetables.)</p><p>What’s not in debate is that Lambda, still the 900-pound gorilla of FaaS, looks a lot different today than when it went GA in 2015. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/">loud, weird niche of engineers</a> who bought into serverless early have always had <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1336765475615879181">very specific ideas</a> about what good serverless systems look like … and lately, Lambda’s been rattling their assumptions.</p><h2 id="h-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-serverless-manifesto">The Decline and Fall of The Serverless Manifesto</h2><p>Those original ideals of FaaS purity didn’t just materialize out of thin air. As recently as 2016, AWS serverless leadership was talking up something they called the Serverless Compute Manifesto. This was a radical vision for how Functions-as-a-Service should, uh, function. The manifesto showed up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOgc3MRUrs">all sorts of talks</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Serverlessconf/status/735839492431548418">at ACG’s ServerlessConf</a>. Here are its key tenets:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2016)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</em></li><li><em>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</em></li><li><em>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</em></li><li><em>Scales per request; Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</em></li><li><em>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</em></li><li><em>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</em></li></ul><p>This manifesto formed a shocking and highly countercultural blueprint for how to build and deploy software. It attracted a small but vibrant community of true believers and a somewhat larger and much louder set of skeptics.&nbsp;</p><p>But in retrospect, the serverless compute manifesto had trouble penetrating beyond that small, engaged nucleus. The bold vision just left out too many existing, legacy workloads and teams.</p><p>So, gradually, like the commandments in Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm, </em>AWS’s non-negotiables of serverless compute began to change. Let’s run through each point of the manifesto and see if Lambda still adheres to it.</p><p><strong>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling?</strong></p><p><em>Sorta, but not strictly. </em>You can deploy multi-function Lambda Layers to manage large binaries, or (now in preview) Lambda Extensions to plug in third-party agents that I’ve been told should definitely not be thought of as “sidecars for Lambda”.</p><p><strong>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>As of re:Invent 2020, Lambda <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">now allows you to bring your own containers</a> instead of just shipping a ZIP file of code.</p><p><strong>Permanent storage lives elsewhere?</strong></p><p><em>Not necessarily. </em>Lambda now integrates with EFS, which I guess is technically “elsewhere”, but no more so than any other NFS share attached to a server is “elsewhere”. It’s a persistent filesystem mounted to your compute.</p><p><strong>Scales per request?</strong></p><p><em>Yes!</em> Now that Lambda can run containers, I believe the request model is now the biggest remaining conceptual difference between Lambda and a managed container service like AWS Fargate. Lambda gives you a new execution environment per concurrent request, whereas a Fargate-like service will still process multiple concurrent requests on the same (long-lived) container.</p><p><strong>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>Meet Provisioned Capacity, which trades your cold start problem for a hot cost problem. (I snark, but Provisioned Capacity is way better than running your own Lambda pre-warming job, which a LOT of people used to do.)</p><p><strong>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true – </em>not if you use Provisioned Capacity or EFS, anyway.</p><p><strong>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere?</strong></p><p><em>Ehhhh. </em>This one is about abstracting away availability zones, which a lot of higher-level AWS services besides Lambda (including Fargate!) now do. That said, we’re starting to hear more guidance from AWS that really, the fault domain you need to be thinking about is regions. That’s right: regions are the new availability zones, and savvy Lambda developers are rolling their own (very un-managed) multi-region architectures as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>To reinforce the trend, let’s check in with two other defining early features of Lambda:</p><p><strong>Intentional time and space constraints?</strong></p><p><em>Less and less true</em>. Function disk sizes, runtime limits, and CPU and memory sizes have steadily increased over the last 5 years. Today you can run a Lambda function for 15 minutes with 10 GB of memory and 6 vCPUs – a hefty enough blob of compute to make you think seriously about multi-threading, multi-purpose functions, and other things that are against the old ideals of FaaS.</p><p><strong>Zero-trust networking?</strong></p><p><em>Only if you want it. </em>In the old days, Lambda architectures biased heavily toward IAM security rather than using VPCs, partly for ideological reasons but also because attaching functions to custom ENIs added tremendous cold start overhead. Today, innovation from AWS has made customer-managed VPCs much more compatible with Lambda.</p><p>So what we have now is an updated manifesto that looks like this:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2020)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><s>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</s></em></li><li><em><s>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</s></em></li><li><em><s>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</s></em></li><li><em>Scales per request; </em><em><s>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</s></em></li><li><em><s>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</s></em></li><li><em><s>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</s></em></li><li><em><s>Intentional time and space constraints</s></em></li><li><em><s>Zero-trust networking</s></em></li></ul><p>I feel like Willy Wonka at the end of the chocolate factory tour, looking around to see where all the children went. Of all those ideological principles, those lines in the sand, <em>per-request scaling is the only thing left.&nbsp;</em></p><p>You can still build according to the original serverless manifesto, of course. But the service doesn’t <em>require </em>you to.</p><p>If you had to distill the revised value prop of Lambda down into a single maxim, <em>Animal Farm-</em>style, what would you even say at this point? “<em>All workloads are managed, but some are more managed than others?</em>“</p><h2 id="h-the-rise-of-serverless-for-everyone">The rise of serverless for everyone</h2><p>This seems like the right time to clarify that I mostly like the additions to Lambda. I think they are necessary and in many cases, an unmixed good.</p><p>I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. I was much more of a FaaS purist at that time. What changed my mind was years of hearing a very particular type of statement from engineering teams, repeated over and over in different variations:</p><p><strong><em>I would love to use Lambda, if only it …</em></strong><em> </em>[connected back to my on-prem VPC, was big enough to run my workload, let me use the same language or developer tooling as my other systems, was always warm, supported some form of shared storage, etc, etc]</p><p>My first reaction to these statements was: Why would you want to use Lambda if you can’t or won’t embrace stateless, containerless, scale-to-zero functions? That’s the whole <em>point </em>of Lambda. It sounded to me like those Kubernetes cats from the New Stack survey, saying they’d really like to eat vegetables if they only contained more meat.</p><p>But I’ve since come to understand that the really powerful part of that statement is the beginning part. It’s a statement of longing.</p><p><em>I’d love to use Lambda, if only …</em></p><p>What is it about Lambda, and serverless compute in general, that inspires this reaction in so many people? Why does a brand-new baby computing paradigm spark such compulsive interest everywhere from tiny startups to big ol’ legacy enterprises?</p><p>Because more than any specific technical detail, serverless computing is an idea. An idea expressed in a simple phrase: <em>Own less, build more. </em>All the serverless doctrine, all the technical guidance boils down to this goal. Lambda is an aspirational lifestyle.</p><p>Lambda, circa 2016, was massively ahead of its time, and to some extent still is. But because of the new feature additions, up to and including container support, it’s making the <em>own less, build more </em>identity more accessible to more builders than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>What AWS is doing is, one by one, taking away the <em>if only</em>s<em>. </em>They’re removing reflexive objections to serverless by providing reassuring options — shared storage, provisioned capacity — for teams that need them. <em>I’d love to use Lambda!</em></p><h2 id="h-guiding-the-future">Guiding the future</h2><p>Will some teams use these features out of confusion or inertia, not realizing that they could build something more radical, more manifesto-like? Yes, and I think this is an area where AWS can do a lot more to help.</p><p>Look, the Lambda console is a mess – you know it, I know it, AWS knows it. It’s got more tacked-on feature creep and incoherent UX paths than a 2001 VCR. And say what you will about infrastructure-as-code, the console is still how people explore new services. It’s how they form feelings about what kind of builders they want to be.</p><p>A console redesign is needed for sure, but not just an arbitrary facelift. We need one that foregrounds the Lambda features that support the original manifesto: code-level programming abstractions, function-level deployments. And then a careful reveal of progressive complexity as you push up against the limits of the manifesto or your own organizational constraints. (Is there such a thing as “regressive complexity”? Because that’s the current console.)</p><p>What you want is for builders to be confronted with the simpler, more managed options every time they start a new …</p></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Automating deploys to Kubernetes using ArgoCD and jsonnet]]>

December 17, 2020 | https://thecloud.christmas/2020/16 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thecloud.christmas/2020/16">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>So you have a Kubernetes-cluster and a bunch of applications. You trigger deploys by manually pushing templated yaml to your cluster. The codebase is large and the manual processes time-consuming and error-prone. You need a better way. Well, let me help you with an opinionated suggestion.</p>
</section><article><section><h2>ArgoCD</h2>
<p><a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/">ArgoCD</a> is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that uses Git repos as the source-of-truth for the desired state of
the cluster (following the <a href="https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/">GitOps</a> philosophy). It runs inside the cluster and continuously monitor the Git repos for changes, rendering them into Kubernetes manifests and applying them to the cluster. So, contrary to the common pipeline approach where changes are pushed in, ArgoCD pulls them. As shown below, it comes with a UI for visualizing resources and their relations, which is particularly handy for newcomers to Kubernetes. (The UI <em>may</em> also be used to administer applications, repositories etc, but then you are engaging in ClickOps rather than GitOps).</p>
<p><img src="https://thecloud.christmas/assets/screenshot-2020-12-14-at-21.31.29.png" alt="The echoserver Application"></p>
<p>The central component is the custom resource <code>Application</code> which basically is a pointer to a Git repo containing code that can be rendered into Kubernetes manifests. You may specify branch/tag, path, whether it should be automatically synced, inject parameters etc. See the doc (which is excellent btw) for <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/application.yaml">an example</a> showing all the knobs.</p>
<h2>Deployment orchestration</h2>
<p>Applications often consist of multiple components that need to be updated during a deploy, and sometimes these components have an internal ordering that must be honored. I.e. "first do this and then do that". Tools that were not built specifically for deploys are often lacking here. Luckily, ArgoCD solves this elegantly using <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks/">resource hooks</a> and <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/">sync waves</a>.</p>
<h2>App-of-apps</h2>
<p>Finally, one of the gems of ArgoCD is the pattern which is referred to as <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern">App-of-apps</a>:</p>
<p>An <code>Application</code> may point to a Git repo that renders additional <code>Application</code> CRs (again pointing to other Git repo), continuing in as long a chain as necessary.</p>
<p>So you can effectively bootstrap your entire stack by seeding ArgoCD with a single
root <code>Application</code> that transitively renders all your <code>Applications</code> and underlying resources. No clicking required. You can of course also propagate relevant parameters such as <code>&lt;env&gt;</code> to all applications as needed. </p>
<h2>Jsonnet</h2>
<p>When it comes to selecting a <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/application_sources/">tool/language</a> for describing the Kubernetes-manifests there will be lots of opinions. This is currently mine:</p>
<p>I am a developer and I like to write code. I like to find the right abstractions and create generic, reusable pieces. I have always struggled with templating languages like Jinja2 or Go-templates because they are so limited and always "get in my way". After reading <a href="https://medium.com/@prune998/using-jsonnet-does-not-have-to-be-complex-54b1ad9b21db">Using Jsonnet does not have to be complex</a> and <a href="https://leebriggs.co.uk/blog/2019/02/07/why-are-we-templating-yaml.html">Why the f**k are we templating yaml?</a> I tried out jsonnet. I had heard it was a bit complex, but my initial skepticism was blown away after trying it. It felt much more familiar than awkward templating languages and factoring the code into reusable components was very easy (see for example <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/kube-libsonnet">bitnami/kube-libsonnet</a>).</p>
<p>In jsonnet, it is quite simple to build a library allowing you to generate the full stack of Kubernetes objects (deployment, service, network policies, ingress, service monitor, etc) just by declaring the stack's config. Something similar to what you would do in a Helm values-file, but achieved with code rather than templating. Below is an example of what that <em>might</em> look like.</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>local lib = import 'lib/v2/lib.libsonnet';

# top-level arguments (tlas) can be injected here<span>:</span>
function(name='echo-server'<span>,</span> namespace='default'<span>,</span> env)
  local vars = lib.loadVars(env);

  (import 'lib/v2/app.libsonnet') <span>{</span>
    # here we are patching the default _config<span>:</span>
    _config+<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      name<span>:</span> name<span>,</span>
      namespace<span>:</span> namespace<span>,</span>

      imageName<span>:</span> 'hashicorp/http-echo'<span>,</span>
      imageTag<span>:</span> vars.tag<span>,</span>
      userPort<span>:</span> <span>8080</span><span>,</span>
      replicas<span>:</span> vars.replicas<span>,</span>

      ingress+<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        path<span>:</span> '/echo/(.*)'<span>,</span>
        rewrite<span>:</span> '/$<span>1</span>'<span>,</span>
        tlsSecret<span>:</span> 'tls-secret-name'<span>,</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>.newAppAsList()</code></pre></div>
<p>If done right, all resources can still be fully patchable. And since the jsonnet code is rendered into JSON which Kubernetes speaks natively, it will (like YAML) still allow you to do stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Validate the resources:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>jsonnet echoserver.jsonnet --tla-str env="test" -J . | kubeval --strict</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dry-run against a cluster:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>jsonnet *.jsonnet --tla-str env="opstest" -J . | kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f -</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diff against a cluster:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>jsonnet *.jsonnet --tla-str env="opstest" -J . | k diff -f -</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is of course typically handled by ArgoCD, but it might still be useful as development tools.</p>
<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>
<p>Using the app-of-apps pattern referred to above, it is possible to seed the ArgoCD-installation with a single <code>Application</code>
which will transitively render all <code>Applications</code> for the system. It might look something like:   </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>argocd-root              # git repo  
  apps/         
    lib/                 # libraries, managed by jsonnet-bundler or via git submodules
    vars/                  
    vars/test.libsonnet  # per-env vars for tracking-branch, autosync, tlas etc 
    apps.jsonnet         # renders all Applications according to vars/&lt;env&gt;.libsonnet, injecting tla for env etc</code></pre></div>
<p>The root-repo will render the echoserver <code>Application</code> and propagate relevant tlas such as <code>&lt;env&gt;</code>. <em>That</em> repo
will in turn render the app-specific Kubernetes-manifests. It might look something like:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>argocd-apps                 # git repo
  apps/
    echoserver/
      lib/                  # libraries, managed by jsonnet-bundler or via git submodules
      vars/
      vars/test.libsonnet   # per-env vars for imageTag, replicas etc  
      config/               # static configuration that goes into configmaps etc
      echoserver.jsonnet
    otherapp/...
    anotherapp/...</code></pre></div>
<p>New <code>Applications</code> are then added by pushing changes to <code>argocd-root</code> and deployments are triggered by pushing changes to <code>argocd-apps</code>. </p>
<p>Voilà! No more manual deploys and hopefully a tidier codebase 🎉.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<li>The transition from breath mint to fruit flavored candy was driven by the plan to market Pez to kids.</li>
<li>The iconic Pez dispenser design is patented.</li>
<li>Some of the rarest Pez dispensers now sell for thousands of dollars.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>OK so you've:</p><ul role="list"><li>Been through ALL the blog posts</li><li>Asked your podcasting friend</li><li>Found guests</li><li>Edited your show</li><li>Finally launched</li></ul><p>And... crickets.</p><p>Yep you feel like all your hard work has gone to waste as you only generated 74 downloads on launch day (which is a great start by the way!).</p><p>You're now not sure whether to continue your show, as it is a LOT of work, but it doesn't seem like people are actually listening to what you have to say.</p><p>Now this makes sense...</p><p>You probably have better things to do than waste your time creating audio content if no one will listen.</p><p>But before that, please do yourself a favour and learn a little more about how to promote a podcast before you give up.</p><p>Back in 2006, you could probably launch a podcast and get a shed load of listeners... not any more. You need to know how to promote.</p><p>To help solve this problem for you, we went to podcasters that have an audience... to ask them how they built it.</p><p>So sit back, grab a black coffee and scroll through the promotion ideas and strategies in this post.</p><p>We hope that this will give you the inspiration to continue your show, build an audience... and make the world a better place.</p><h2>1. Mark de Rijk</h2><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8d8ab496d65849f731ba00/5fd77e55a458e35a75bf8bcd_fU4BNwZ-tMXVAyDcXYaqOn_ZTPt6p6IpMI7EUR1gBBvIru5m_G4Kae47zPqckSQcP75oZ7XubYAuzVVvynDrWEI3-0IeqwLqBs8-JNlAMVYR6gJAX2h6RjXziXihqumMKA0Kcuc.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>When we asked Mark De Rijk from SME Business Podcast about the strategy that helped him to get more downloads, this is what he had to say:</p><p>"I am transcribing my episodes and reposting them as a blog on my website and medium. I also run an automated social media campaign using Missinglettr to push out to various social media accounts"</p><p>So Mark is capitalising on SEO value through transcription and them pushing out that content to social... nice Mark.</p><p>Mark De Rijk runs the SME Business Podcast, giving a voice to founders of small and medium businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out his show here: <a href="https://podcast.cybersecurityexpertontap.com/" target="_blank">SME Business Podcast</a><br></p><h2>2. Julie Alberding<br></h2><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8d8ab496d65849f731ba00/5fd7822e91a9685dd1f246c8_Julie.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Julie Alberding from Macro N Cheese shares what's working for them: hosting the show on their own domain.</p><p>This meant that people that wanted to listen to the show would land on their site and often check out their business.</p><p>They create custom cover art for every podcast and then add this along with their embedded bCast player, their guests social links and show notes for every episode. This also allows listeners to comment, allowing them to connect and gain feedback from their audience.</p><p>Here is what Julie has to say:</p><p>"The biggest change we've made this year, though, is to add full transcripts to each episode, and the feedback from listeners has been fantastic. We were even able to attract a coveted guest who refuses to be interviewed if a transcript is not included"</p><p>You can listen to the podcast here: <a href="https://realprogressives.org/macro-n-cheese-podcast/" target="_blank">Macro N Cheese<strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p><h2>3.

Their podcast is actually about growth... so it kind of makes sense ;)</p><p>Here is what Serhat Kaya shared with us:</p><p>"It's usually a combination of things:</p><p>Leveraging our guests' network and reach by sharing everything they might need so that it's easy as possible. These can be the links to our podcast, sometimes episode cover, or videos. It helps to point out that the more people tune in, the more people also engage with this particular episode and, therefore, with the guest. It's a win-win.</p><p>We are teasing snippets of an interesting part of the episode right before the intro to increase downloads. This increases the chance that people continue to listen.</p><p>Answering questions on Quora with insights from our podcast and leaving the link to the right episode for further interest.</p><p>There are lots of other things we do and try. One thing we still need to try is having five guests and having with each one a short conversation about a certain topic. Different and special format. But here is what makes it interesting: 5x the power of guest network reach, and people interested in a certain topic get insights from five different experts. Chances are that they listen to all five short talks"</p><p>The summary of their approach:</p><ul role="list"><li>Use your network</li><li>Use your guest's network</li><li>Create avenues for your audience to connect with you </li><li>Give teasers that intrigue listeners</li></ul><p>You can listen to the podcast here: <a href="https://www.growth-show.com/" target="_blank">The Growth Show</a>&nbsp;<br></p><h2>4.

I wasn't sold on using Libsyn, but I signed up because it felt like the only place to run my podcast from, based on the people I had spoken to at the time. But a friend of mine recommended bCast a couple of months ago, and I decided to give it a try. I loved the interface immediately, but the surprising advantage of moving was a broader reach (the podcast was loaded on more sites like I Heart Radio and more), where I didn't have that before. Plus, just with the native swap itself, my downloads immediately saw an increase. It was fantastic!"</p><p>Sometimes podcast growth can be a simple as switching podcast host ;)</p><p>Check out Carissa's podcast here: <a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/the-author-revolution-podcast" target="_blank">The Author Revolution Podcast</a></p><h2>5.

They SEO optimised YouTube video versions of their show and then gained exposure on social through cutting down and sharing clips.</p><p>In his own words:</p><p>"We started taking our 45 min-1 hour-long video podcast interviews and then repurpose them into 8-12 minute videos that would be based on questions that we could try to rank keywords for on our YouTube channel. We'd also create 1-2 minute video clips for social media to go back to the full video. Still, our optimisation strategy for YouTube SEO is our long term play since podcasting channels don't have much for ranking through search"</p><p>You can listen to Akeel's podcast here: <a href="https://horizencapital.com/saas-podcast/" target="_blank">SaaS District</a><br></p><h2>7.

I then ‘cut’ that piece up into shorter formats for people that want to consume my content in different ways. I create a shorter version of it and create a video out of it; I use a bit similar transcript of the video to create a podcast episode out of it, and so on. And of course, each piece links to each other, ‘want to consume this piece of content in audio, check it out here…’, etc. That interlinking helps a lot"</p><p>And if your podcast is new:</p><p>"If you're just starting out, of course, don't forget to submit your podcast to all different directories out there (there is so much more than just the iTunes or Spotify directory, and each directory gives you the opportunity to be discovered by a new set of listeners again"</p><p>You can listen to Han's podcast here: <a href="https://podcast.usergrowth.io/" target="_blank">Growing Your Business Through Digital Marketing</a></p><h2>9.

That means creating contact with people and not treating your followers just as numbers. Generally speaking, being empathetic is the key in every interaction we have"</p><p>The second thing Frank did that worked was to:</p><p>"Another route I tried and found to be very functional is writing a good old press release.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is a post I've been wanting to write for a while now. I want to put down in layman's terms what various cryptographic operations represent, and common use cases for them. When designing large systems we don't need to get bogged down in details of how a Diffie-Hellman handshake works, what we need are abstractions, patterns and black boxes we can effectively use together and reason about.</p><p>With this post I hope to present terms you may or may not have heard before, hopefully with a few examples, one for anyone to understand and at least one for developers to understand.</p><p>Before we go any further it's worth mentioning the old adage - never roll your own crypto. Always build on proven, audited libraries and preferably get the implementation looked at by someone who knows what they're doing. Cryptographic operations can fail (often silently) in unpredictable ways, leaving you stuck with the assumption that what you've built is secure, when it's really not.</p><div><h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2><p>Hashing has many, many use cases in the digital world. For our purposes it can be easiest to explain hashing as a deep check for equality. Given two things (files, sentences, words, images) how do we ascertain that they are identical? This can be hard to reason about outside of computing because almost never are two items perfectly equal.</p><h5 id="in-a-system">In a system</h5><p>The most common use case almost all of us will be familiar with is password hashing. When users enter their password we don’t want to store that in plaintext, if a database of raw user passwords was leaked it’d be catastrophic. What we do instead is hash the password and store that. If the database is ever leaked the user passwords can’t be reversed from the hash.</p><p>I don’t need to provide another example for hashing because it’s so common, however let’s briefly look at how we might leverage hashing to build a custom image caching system. When we browse user profiles on a mobile application, the mobile application (hopefully) doesn’t fetch the images every time you see the image. What it <em>could</em> do, to save bandwidth, is just send the hash of the current image to the server. The server checks if this hash matches the hash of the latest upload, and only sends the new image if it doesn’t match, meaning the clients version is outdated.</p><h2 id="symmetric-encryption">Symmetric encryption</h2><p>Symmetric encryption is something most of us are probably familiar with, however if not, it’s simply the act of encrypting something with a key. If you don’t have the key, you can’t decrypt the data.</p><p>A good analogy can be to liken symmetric encryption with a safe. It’s big, heavy and you know whatever’s in there is going to be private. If you’ve got the combination - awesome - you’ve got full access to it. If not, you’re out of luck and you’re gonna have to try break it open.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-1">In a system</h5><p>As a practical example of symmetric encryption in a wider digital system, imagine you want to save data in the cloud. You’ve run out of space on your laptop and want to use Dropbox to store your data. Just sending your data to Dropbox is a recipe for disaster, anyone at Dropbox would be able to view your private information. However if you generate a symmetric key and encrypt your data with it before sending it to Dropbox, you know no one else is going to be able to see it.</p><h2 id="asymmetric-encryption">Asymmetric encryption</h2><p>Asymmetric encryption is a really powerful concept we can model entire systems around. It all boils down to there being a different key for encryption and decryption.</p><p>As a simple example, let’s liken asymmetric encryption to a letterbox. With a letterbox anyone can put mail in it, however only people with the key can read said mail. This is at odds with symmetric encryption from our previous example, where you need the key to put anything into the box.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-2">In a system</h5><p>I’ve struggled here to just pick one example to explore, but perhaps the most relevant is encrypted communication. With asymmetric encryption you have a public key (this is what others see, like the name on your letterbox) and you have a private key (like the name suggests, this one should be kept secret - otherwise anyone could open your letterbox). When two users want to communicate securely they simply encrypt their messages to the recipients public key. Now no one else other than those two can read their messages. To spell this out:</p><ul><li>User B (recipient) publishes their public key</li><li>User A (sender) encrypts a message to B’s public key</li><li>User A sends the encrypted message to B</li><li>User B receives the message and decrypts it with their private key.</li></ul><h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2><p>Another great aspect of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to provide proof that a message came from someone in particular. To use the mail analogy again, this can be thought of as a stamp on the letter. You know that only Steve has the stamp “Steve’s stamp”, so you can trust any letter with this to be from him.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-3">In a system</h5><p>Digital signatures are used almost everywhere in the internet today. In the context of cryptocurrency and blockchains, every transaction you send it accompanied by a signature over the payload you’re sending - asserting that it came from you.</p><p>Let’s also take a moment to think about internal or external communication between various services you’ve written. How do you know when a request comes from your payments service that it’s really your payments service sending this message? When a user of your website does an action (buying an item, for example), how do you tie that action to the right user?</p><p>A common solution is signed payloads, <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a> being a popular specification to follow. A session token is any many aspects just a signature over some payload you’ve provided, an assertion that at some point this user authenticated with you. A basic user authentication flow might go:</p><ul><li>User sends you their username and password</li><li>You verify that the password hash matches the saved hash for this username</li><li>You generate a signed payload that includes their unique ID and potentially anything else you don’t want to have to read from the database for every request.</li></ul><p>Now every request that comes to your server can just verify the signature provided, and you allow them access to the system based on that.</p><h2 id="blind-signatures">Blind Signatures</h2><p>A blind signature is one where the signer doesn’t need to about the contents of the message. This can be hard to reason about but one simple example is in an election voting situation. Alice comes in to vote and proves her identity to the officials at the location. After voting (her choice remains a secret) she hands the sealed envelope to the official, who signs and submits it. In this case the signer has no idea what choice Alice has made, however later at the vote counting station we can verify that this envelope is valid because it was signed by an official.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-4">In a system</h5><p>We could improve upon the above voting example and think about payments. Imagine we’re wanting to make a payment somewhere and not have the merchant know our identity, this is where we could leverage blind signatures to make transactions privately.</p><ol><li>We go to the bank and ask for a cheque for $100</li><li>We take this cheque and send our order to a shop (anonymously), asking for $100 worth of goods</li><li>The shop can verify this blind signature with the bank and send our goods to our specified address</li><li>We’ve successfully completed a purchase without either the bank knowing what we’re buying, or the merchant knowing who we are.</li></ol><h2 id="secret-sharing">Secret sharing</h2><p>I’ve wracked my brain for hours trying to think of a good analogy for secret sharing, but I wasn’t able to come up with one. Essentially it comes down to (what seems like) magic, you and another party are able to agree on something without ever communicating, it’s pretty cool.</p><p>What we’re talking about here are Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. They underpin almost all modern communication. Most of your browser traffic these days is secured via TLS (which implies some kind of key exchange between your browser and the server) however I’d like to explore another cool use case in the context of privacy preserving applications.</p><p>Before we dive into the example, at the highest level a Diffie-Hellman key exchange works as follows:</p><ul><li><code>DH(Alice's public key, Bob's private key) = shared_secret</code></li><li><code>DH(Bob's public key, Alice's private key) = shared_secret</code></li></ul><p>This <code>shared_secret</code> is only computable by Alice and Bob, no one else would be able to figure it out.</p><h5 id="a-use-case">A use case</h5><p>Let’s explore how we could build a privacy preserving messaging platform using a centralised database. At its most basic (and totally open) a message between two parties would look like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>from</th><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alice</td><td>Bob</td><td>Hi!</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>Alice</td><td>Hey! What’s up?</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is how most applications have been built for the last twenty years. Maybe data is encrypted at rest, but in my experience working at software companies encryption at rest means nothing, every employee still has access to this data on demand, in the worst case it’s a Jira ticket away.</p><p>Step one in our privacy preserving journey is to encrypt the data swapped between parties, Alice encrypts messages to Bob’s public key and vice-versa. Now we as the providers of this service can’t see the data being swapped:</p><table><thead><tr><th>from</th><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alice</td><td>Bob</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>Alice</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>However here we can unfortunately still tell that Alice and Bob are communicating. What could we do to hide the communication between these two?</p><p>One solution I’ll propose - which also has the benefit of sender privacy, so we’re killing two birds with one stone here - would be to generate a shared secret and hash it with the recipients identifier. Now messages just have a <code>payload</code> and a <code>to</code> property. The <code>to</code></p><table><thead><tr><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Alice)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Remember only Alice and Bob can generate this shared secret, and the HASH function is some irreversible function that hides its content. Now whenever Bob wants to find messages from Alice he computes <code>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</code> and queries all messages that match that <code>to</code> field.</p><p>As you can see now we only …</p></div></div>

	<section>
		<p>Working in many different environments provided me a good perspective on what scaling models are applied by different companies. Today I'd like to spend a bunch of keystrokes on one of the worst scaling models I've ever encountered.</p><p>I call it:</p><blockquote>Scaling by bubbling the problems out</blockquote><p>A <em>'busy person'</em>, usually a leader or manager, identifies a persistent problem within the organization: something that consumes focus and time, impacts the quality, slows down the value delivery, etc. This problem is either completely new (caused by the growth) or has evolved over time, but now its severity is more apparent.</p><p>Here are a few examples (of such problems) to make sure we're on the same page:</p><ul><li><strong>the number of quality defects</strong> (for the whole product) is increasing; until now, each team had been able to deal with their deliverables' quality</li><li><strong>the quality of internal communication</strong> deteriorates - people start complaining they don't know what's happening in the org, there are more and more misunderstandings and misalignments</li><li>the engineering unit needs to grow, and the <strong>recruitment takes more time increasingly</strong> - hereby hemorrhaging the last reserves of time of the unit's manager</li></ul><p>Initially, such a problem is dealt with in an ad-hoc way (through a one-off, point-directed action). But it keeps popping up back (as due to its nature, it can't be eliminated permanently). Apparently, that kind of a problem requires continuous effort and ownership (to make sure it doesn't get out of control).</p><p>Finally, the <em>'busy person'</em> (mentioned above) decides that burying her/his head in the sand won't work anymore, so why not do what all the handbooks advise?</p><p>That sounds like a tremendous idea, but the devil is in details. The <em>'busy person'</em> doesn't delegate responsibility, function, or role. (S)he <strong>outsources</strong> the problem by creating a new (formal or no) position (or even a sub-unit) to deal with that problem, so all the annoyances are out of the <em>'busy person's'</em> back.</p><p>This way the problem is contained within some sort of a <strong>bubble</strong>, but it's someone else's bubble! Problem-related black box our <em>'busy person'</em> doesn't have to worry about.</p><p>Got it?</p><ul><li>Problem <strong>X</strong> -&gt; <strong>X</strong> Manager / <strong>X</strong> Team</li><li><strong>Quality </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Quality </strong>Manager / <strong>Quality </strong>(Assurance) Team</li><li><strong>Communication </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Communication </strong>Manager / <strong>Communication</strong> Team</li><li><strong>Recruitment </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Recruitment </strong>Manager / <strong>Recruitment </strong>Team</li></ul><p>Oh, how convenient is that! If the problem re-appears, it's clear who's guilt...^M^M^M to be asked to fix the situation.</p><p>As the crisis is prevented now, the <em>'busy person'</em> continues with her/his quest, smug and oblivious to the consequences of the change just made ...</p><p>Yes, it seems that short-term, we're all good here. Putting someone in charge of the crisis sounds like a decent plan. But it's not really what happened here. A new position has been spawned <strong>not to solve</strong> the actual problem (which may be hidden and unobvious) <strong>but to patch</strong> its visible symptoms, potentially making the organization more complex, inter-dependent, and bureaucratic.</p><p>Instead of well-thought-through systemic change, we're adding a sub-unit (usually with the manager in charge) with the responsibility of dealing with problem X. If you had any hopes for getting rid of problem X permanently - abandon any faith in that. If problem X is the sole reason for the sub-unit's existence, it will subliminally act <strong>to preserve and solidify</strong> that problem (under control, but still).</p><p>In more simple words:</p><ol><li>no wider context</li><li>no holistic view (to understand the flow of work and value, or the nature of the problem)</li><li>no systemic approach (System's Theory)</li></ol><p>While in fact the solutions to before-mentioned problems may be much more simple and straightforward:</p><ul><li><strong>the quality issues</strong> may be a result of reaching the critical capacity of manual regression testing (with test automation as a likely answer) or pushing quality checks towards the end of process (e.g. by not doing proper reviews)</li><li><strong>internal communication</strong> could deteriorate because of the increasing number of actors - a good idea is to check the component/area boundaries to verify the number &amp; validity of dependencies; other potential root cause may be an underlying conflict or misaligned priorities of two (or more) parties</li><li><strong>extensive recruitment</strong> will be a problem if you centralize the 'gating' too much - although acquiring talent is manager's/leader's duty, (s)he should get a lot of control over it directly to the teams (who are looking for more members) - it's their skin in the game of getting the most proper people on board</li></ul><hr><p>Just to make sure I'm clear - what I'm saying here is not against the popular principle of <em>'single-threaded teams'</em> (ones dedicated end-to-end, exclusively to well-defined narrow topic). I'm all for crystal-clear focus and unequivocal responsibility range, but the area covered by such a team should be <strong>defined by product/service vision</strong>, instead of what kind of piece of garbage has been thrown over the fence to save you some time ...</p>

<p>I was reading the
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.10">Linux 5.10 release summary on KernelNewbies</a>, and a
section stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.6. Static calls for improved post-Spectre performance</p>

  <p>Static calls are a replacement for global function pointers. They use code patching to allow
direct calls to be used instead of indirect calls. They give the flexibility of function pointers,
but with improved performance. This is especially important for cases where retpolines would
otherwise be used, as retpolines can significantly impact performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Linux kernel, but never directly at its indirect call
setup or post-<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> mitigations. These changes sound very cool,
so I’m going to use this post to try and explain and understand them (both to myself and others).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of the original authors of the patchset has emailed me with some corrections
and answers to the questions that I ask below. I’ve marked each with either “Correction” or
“Update.” Thanks, Peter!</p>

<h2 id="background-indirect-calls-spectre-and-retpolines">Background: indirect calls, Spectre, and retpolines</h2>

<h3 id="indirect-calls">Indirect calls</h3>

<p>Indirect calls are one of C’s most powerful language features, and are critical for writing
higher-order code without a supplementary object or function/method dispatch system.</p>

<p>Most C programmers are familiar with the basics of indirect calls, thanks to standard and POSIX
functions like <code>qsort</code> and <code>pthread_create</code>: each takes a <em>function pointer</em>, which it then
calls internally to complete the functionality of the surrounding call:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/P44Ghq">Godbolt</a>).</em></p>

<p>Observe: our <code>call</code> goes through a memory or register operand (<code>[rbp - 8]</code>)<sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">1</a></sup> to get the target,
instead of a direct target specified by the operand value itself (like, say,
<code>call 0xacabacab ; @good_rand</code>). That’s what makes it indirect.</p>

<p>But we can go even further than this! Indeed, a common pattern in C is to declare
entire <em>structures</em> of operations, using each to parametrize a lower level set of behaviors
(for example, the core POSIX I/O APIs) over independent implementations.</p>

<p>This is exactly how <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">FUSE</a> works: every FUSE client
creates its own <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/cd4aae2de6aacad31a15791bbb52adf173561a6d/include/fuse.h#L299-L790"><code>fuse_operations</code></a>:</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this technique isn’t limited to userspace: the Linux kernel itself makes
aggressive use of indirect calls, particularly in architecture-agnostic interfaces
(like the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">VFS</a> and sub-specializations
like <code>procfs</code>) and the architecture-specific internals of subsystems like

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor">hot in the pants</a> trying
to squeeze extra performance out of them<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf">2</a></sup>, and we ended up with
<a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre v2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spectre-v2">Spectre (v2)</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/spectre.png" alt="The Spectre logo"></p>

<p>The exact mechanism that Spectre v2 (also known as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>) exploits is
<em>slightly</em> out of scope of this post, but at a high level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modern (x86) CPUs contain an <em>indirect branch predictor</em>, which attempts to guess the target
of an indirect call or jump.</p>

    <p>To actually speed things up, the CPU <strong>speculatively executes</strong> the
 predicted branch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A correct prediction means that the indirect call completes significantly faster
 (since it’s already executing or has finished executing speculatively);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A misprediction <strong>should</strong> result in a slower (but still
 successful) indirect call with <strong>no side effects from the incorrect speculation.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words: the CPU is responsible for <strong>rolling back</strong> any side effects associated
 with any misprediction and subsequent speculation. Mis-speculation is a <em>microarchitectural</em>
 detail that should not manifest in <em>architectural</em> changes, like modified registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rolling back</strong> any mis-speculated state is a relatively expensive operation, with a lot of
microarchitectural implications: cache lines and other bits of state need to be fixed up so that
the <em>actual</em> program control flow isn’t tainted by failed speculations.</p>

    <p>In practice, rolling back the entire speculated state would undo most of the advantages
 of speculating in the first place. Instead of doing that, x86 and other ISAs will just mark
 (many) of the bits of speculated state (like cache lines) as stale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fixup behavior (either reverting or marking speculated state) results in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel</em></a>: an attacker can
<em>train</em> the branch predictor to speculatively execute a bit of code
(not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadget</a>) that modifies
a piece of microarchitectural state in a data-dependent manner, such as a cache entry
whose address is dependent on a secret value that was speculatively fetched.</p>

    <p>The attacker can then <em>probe</em> that microarchitectural state by <strong>timing</strong> access to it:
 fast accesses indicate a speculatively modified state, disclosing the secret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original Spectre v2 attack focused on cache lines since they’re relatively easy to time, even
from high level (and sandboxed!) languages that don’t have access to
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_30.html"><code>clflush</code></a> or other cache-line
primitives on x86. But the concept is a general one: it’s difficult to execute speculatively without
leaking <em>some</em> information, and subsequent vulnerabilities (like <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">MDS</a> and
<a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">ZombieLoad</a>) have exposed information leaks in other
microarchitectural features.</p>

<p>This is bad news: an attacker running one of the <strong>safest</strong> contexts (JavaScript or other managed
code, in a sandbox, in userspace) can conceivably train the indirect branch predictor to
speculatively execute a gadget in kernelspace, potentially
<a href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">disclosing kernel memory</a>.</p>

<p>So, the kernel needed a new mitigation. That mitigation is <em>retpolines</em>.</p>

<h3 id="retpolines">Retpolines</h3>

<p>To mitigate Spectre v2, the kernel needs to prevent the CPU from speculating on an attacker
controlled indirect branch.</p>

<p>A retpoline (short for <em>ret</em>urn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)"><em>trampoline</em></a>) does exactly that: indirect
jumps and calls are surrounded by a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a> that
effectively traps the speculated execution in an infinite loop, spinning it until the misprediction
is resolved.</p>

<p>Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf">Retpoline whitepaper</a>
has some helpful illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/retpoline.png" alt="A visualization of speculative execution with and without a retpoline."></p>

<p>This works by converting the indirect control flow from an <em>indirect branch</em> to an
<em>indirect return</em><sup id="fnref:allreturns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:allreturns">3</a></sup>, hence the “ret” in retpoline. Returns are <em>also</em> predicted,
but with an additional mechanism given priority: the
<a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2018/04/ras-microbenchmarks/">Return Stack Buffer</a><sup id="fnref:rsb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rsb">4</a></sup>. To ensure that
the RSB can’t be maliciously trained away from the infinite loop, the retpoline begins with a
direct <code>CALL</code> that primes the RSB to always<sup id="fnref:notalways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notalways">5</a></sup> predict the infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here’s what an indirect call retpoline <em>actually</em> looks like<sup id="fnref:ool" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ool">6</a></sup>, simplified significantly from
the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S">kernel</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h">source</a>:</p>

<p>…all of that to replace a simple <code>call [rax]</code>!</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are repercussions for this kind of trickery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s slow when correctly predicted: we’ve replaced a single indirect <code>CALL</code> with at least two
direct <code>CALL</code>s, plus a <code>RET</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s <em>really</em> slow when mispredicted: we <em>literally</em> spin in place using <code>PAUSE</code> and <code>LFENCE</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a ROP gadget, so it <em>looks</em> like an exploit primitive. That means it screws with Intel’s

<p>Asset valuation and, in particular, Bitcoin valuation is hard. Although Bitcoin is empirically one of the best investments of the past decade, it remains controversial. It has simultaneously been compared to the internet revolution and to the Tulip bubble. Bitcoin is an experiment; failure is still possible.</p><p><strong>What if Bitcoin succeeds? How much will it be worth 10 years from now?</strong></p><p>Investors have well-established frameworks for evaluating assets like equities, credit, and real estate. Yet there is no clear framework for Bitcoin. My opinion is Bitcoin could have an enormous upside if it catches on. In this article, you will learn why Bitcoin could hit a $1M valuation by 2030 if the adoption continues to grow.</p><h3 id="key-takeaways-">Key takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Supply/demand balance of commodities such as oil and gold</li><li>Supply/demand balance of Bitcoin</li><li>Price prediction of Bitcoin: 3 scenarios</li></ul><p><em>First time here?

</section><h2 id="the-supply-demand-balance-of-commodities">The supply/demand balance of commodities</h2><p>The first step of asset valuation is to understand fundamental economics. Equities, bonds, and real estate derive their value from cash flows (and future cash flows). Whereas commodities (such as oil, gold, or bitcoin) are utility-based, and their price depends more on supply and demand. No clear framework exists for them.</p><h3 id="oil-supply-demand-balance">Oil supply/demand balance</h3><p>Oil price is the balance between supply and demand. If the demand increases, you can expect the price to increase as well. If demand drops, price drops. The same goes with supply (in the opposite direction).</p><p>Human civilization requires a certain number of barrels of oil per day to function. That number can be estimated. On the supply side, it costs a certain amount of money to get the oil out of the ground (depending on the technology used, localization, and taxes). If it costs $50 to get a barrel worth of oil out of the ground, then the long-term oil price can't really go below that level for too long. If it does go below that floor price, oil companies will go bankrupt. Supply will decrease, and the price will correct back toward a new equilibrium level.</p><p>In the past months, because of Covid-19, the oil demand dropped (no planes, cars, less energy consumption in general) while the supply stayed the same. Oil price dropped.</p><p>The price stayed so low for so long that some oil producers could not cope with it and went out of business. The oil supply decreased, oil prices corrected and started to increase again.</p><p>The demand is still low; however, it is increasing. As more and more countries go out of lock-down. And with the vaccines coming, we see the end of the tunnel. Ultimately, my bet is the oil will not only get back to the previous level but also surpass them. Remember: Some oil companies went out of business, so the supply is lower than before the crisis. The demand is getting back to normal.</p><p>What applies to oil also applies to silver, gold, and bitcoin.</p><h3 id="gold-supply-demand-balance">Gold supply/demand balance</h3><p>Gold, unlike oil, is not consumed nor destroyed. Gold that existed thousands of years ago still is in circulation today. The global reserve of gold is, therefore, constantly increasing. For the price of gold to stay constant, you need a demand that matches the supply. There are two sources of gold supply:</p><ul><li>75% come from gold mining. Approximately 2,500-3,000 tonnes per year.</li><li>25% come from recycling, most of it comes from jewelry.</li></ul><p>According to the World Gold Council, about 175,000 tonnes have been mined since the beginning of existence. The new mining represents an inflation rate of the gold supply of about 1.7% per year.</p><p>The average inflation of the U.S. dollar is about 2-3% per year.</p><h3 id="bitcoin-supply-demand-balance">Bitcoin supply/demand balance</h3><p>Bitcoin supply is different: it is predictable. It is set in stone and won't change even if most <em>miners</em> go out of business.</p><p>Bitcoin supply is halved every 4 years. No matter what. We can compute Bitcoin current and future average inflation rate and plot it against gold:</p><figure><img src="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png" alt="Bitcoin inflation rate as a function of time (orange line) and gold average inflation rate (yellow line)" srcset="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 1000w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 1600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bitcoin inflation rate as a function of time (orange line) and gold average inflation rate (yellow line).</figcaption></figure><p>On May 11, 2020, the last Bitcoin Halving dropped Bitcoin's inflation rate from 3.6% to 1.8% and will soon cross gold's inflation rate. What does it mean? Bitcoin supply will grow slower than the gold supply.</p><p><a href="https://thenextwave.blog/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">As we've seen</a>, scarcity is one of Bitcoin's (main) feature. There is a fixed supply of bitcoins that can ever be <em>mined</em>. Currently, there are over 18.5 million bitcoins in existence, and the theoretical limit is 21 million. <strong>There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.</strong> Think about it: this is, at most, 0.003 bitcoins per human being.</p><p>This is key. Even gold does not share the same property: every year, tons of gold is mined. Yes, there is a limited supply underground, but there is also an <strong>unlimited</strong> supply in space. You think I'm joking? <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/29/metal-asteroid-psyche-nasa-hubble-images/6069223002/">Look what NASA found</a>.</p><h2 id="price-prediction-of-bitcoin-3-scenarios">Price prediction of Bitcoin: 3 scenarios</h2><p>Bitcoin has significant headroom if it continues to gain broader acceptance. How big can it grow? I based my estimates on the current worldwide value of all mediums of exchanges and stores of value comparable to Bitcoin.</p><p>Let's dive into 3 different scenarios (by increasing order of optimism).</p><h3 id="future-bitcoin-price-if-considered-a-store-of-value">Future Bitcoin price if considered a store of value</h3><p>The first milestone Bitcoin will reach the store of value status. Bitcoin does not have the history of gold as a store of value. However, do you imagine millennials buying and storing gold as some older generations did? Would they rather own Bitcoin instead? It certainly is easier to store, transport, buy, and sell. Gold does not have more reason to be considered a store of value as <a href="https://thenextwave.blog/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">Bitcoin has</a>.</p><p>For this first scenario, we compare Bitcoin's market size to gold's. Gold aggregate value is estimated to be nine trillion dollars (December 2020). <strong>If Bitcoin achieved that capitalization on a base of 21M coins, each coin would be worth ~$420,000.</strong></p><p>Beyond complementing gold's investment demand, Bitcoin may also address broader store of value markets indirectly. Consider various collectibles like art or gemstones, some of which are owned primarily as stores of value. Or consider the empty NYC apartment owned by a foreigner interested in storing value outside his or her native country. Bitcoin could plausibly address subsets of these behaviors more effectively. As it is difficult to estimate, we don't include it in our scenario.</p><p>Bitcoin offers many more possibilities compared to gold. So, what are the next steps?</p><p>As you know, it is difficult to use gold as a medium of exchange. Transporting gold on the street to buy goods is impractical. However, using Bitcoin is entirely feasible. Therefore the market demand for an asset such as Bitcoin could vastly exceed gold. Especially given the prevailing direction of global monetary policy.</p><h3 id="future-bitcoin-price-if-considered-as-money-medium-of-exchange-m1-money">Future Bitcoin price if considered as money/medium of exchange: M1 money</h3><p>The money supply is broken into different buckets: M0, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp">M1</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp">M2</a>, and MZM. M0 refers to currency in circulation. M1 is M0 plus demand deposits like checking accounts. Since M1 is readily accessible for use in commerce, we consider this bucket as a medium of exchange. It includes:</p><ul><li>Physical currency (coins and banknotes)</li><li>Demand deposits, travelers' checks, and other checkable deposits,</li><li>Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts</li></ul><p>The global M1 Money stock by region is about:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1">$6.5 trillion</a> in the U.S.</li><li><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m1">$12 trillion</a> in Europe.</li><li><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/china/money-supply-m1">$9 trillion</a> in China</li><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MYAGM1JPM189N">$7 trillion</a> in Japan</li></ul><p>40 trillion dollars is a conservative lower-bound for global M1 Money stock (which includes M0). If Bitcoin were to achieve a 10% market penetration as a medium of exchange, its market capitalization in today's money would be 4 trillion U.S. dollars.<strong> It would lead to a $190,000 price increase per bitcoin. So about $610,000 per bitcoin.</strong></p><h3 id="future-bitcoin-price-if-considered-as-money-of-zero-maturity">Future Bitcoin price if considered as Money of Zero Maturity</h3><p>The money of zero maturity (MZM) is an even broader bucket. MZM has become one of the preferred measures of the money supply. It represents money readily available for spending and consumption. It includes:</p><ul><li>Our previously defined M1 money</li><li>Savings accounts</li><li>Money market funds</li></ul><p>The global MZM Money stock by region is about:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM">$22 trillion</a> in the U.S.</li><li><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m3">$18 trillion</a> in Europe.</li><li><a href="https://take-profit.org/en/statistics/money-supply-m1/china/">$34 trillion</a> in China</li><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MYAGM3JPM189N">$14 trillion</a> in Japan.</li></ul><p>100 trillion dollars is a conservative lower-bound for global MZM Money stock. If Bitcoin were to achieve 10% of this total estimate for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdax.asp">the global value of mediums of exchange</a> and store of value, its market capitalization would reach 10 trillion U.S. dollars. <strong>If Bitcoin achieved that capitalization on a base of 21M coins, each coin would be worth ~$920,000.</strong></p><p>None of the above account for the dollar's inflation rate, which is about 2%-3% per year. It will easily bring the valuation to more than one million dollars per bitcoin.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><blockquote> "All models are wrong, some are useful." – George Box (Mathematician)</blockquote><p>It is important to understand our framework's variables. From our model it is possible that Bitcoin's price will increase by orders of magnitude. But it all depends on Bitcoin's level of adoption: <strong>The most important question is: "Will people use Bitcoin?"</strong></p><p><strong>Further readings:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-price-will-bitcoin-reach-this-time?utm_source=coinmarketcap&amp;utm_medium=alert&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=btcpricepredictions&amp;utm_term=">What price will Bitcoin reach?</a></li><li><a href="https://thenextwave.blog/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">Is Bitcoin the new Gold?

Something so mind-altering that it questions your definition of what you’ve known to be true for so long. I imagine the first people to watch a film or see an airplane felt this. It’s an inexplicable energy that has the power to redefine. In many ways, artists have been at the center of challenging commonly held beliefs, and using entirely new mediums to express speculative ideas. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-fa7pc"><span><span>While never the first thing to come to mind when discussing art, creative coding is revolutionizing what art is and can be. As we enter a more digital world, creative coding may be the contemporary art movement we need in order to articulate major societal challenges we are facing as technology advances. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-gar4"><span><span>Put simply, creative coding is an emerging specialty that utilizes code and programming as a medium to create art. Programming’s versatility and ubiquitous nature makes it especially expressive, allowing it to manifest itself as digital paintings, data visualization, or even robotics. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-aesrq"><span><span>Unlike the functional focus of most uses of code - like the code lines of a navigation app - creative coding uses programming languages for a solely artistic purpose.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-bg2ev"><span><span>As artists, we generally hold a stigma regarding coding having high barriers to entry, and as engineers, we also hold a stigma surrounding the difficulties of creative expression.

Their work touches on deep social themes and has been exhibited internationally in spaces like the MoMa. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-fduu8"><span><span><em>Audience</em>, one of their earlier pieces of work from 2008, uses motion tracking software and creative coding to create an almost uncomfortable, anthropomorphic experience. As a gallery visitor steps in front of rows of individually dancing mirrors, they instantly synchronize and lock onto the viewer. With 100 mirrors now looking right back at you, you then become the focal point of your own onlooking. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-8dmeo"><span><span>Created by Marpi Studio, New Nature is a digitally interactive petting zoo that relies on gesture-based technology and programming to create virtual organisms. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-65ego"><span><span>Through machine learning, Marpi has forged a virtual terrarium of creatures and plants that rely on the physical interactions of the viewers to come alive.

Using real-time data processing tools and algorithmic software, fuse* creates a living piece of art that constantly evolves and adapts depending on its interactions with onlookers. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-bna5m"><span><span>The artworks are constantly generating new visuals in response to the viewers, their social networks, sound and more. This solo exhibition by fuse*, which premiered in Washington DC in 2019, creates digitally interactive experiences independently of an artist. Its self-sufficient and generative nature suggests an entirely new form of artistic expression.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-274p6"><span><span>Casey Reas’ <em>Infinite Command Team</em> investigates the relationship between particles that are encoded to construct images, and the code that forges those particles. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-c3cum"><span><span>Using pixelation of different weights and sizes, the piece creates a digital mosaic of television signals that become abstract and collage-like, reminiscent of TV channel-surfing. The piece is a celebration of art and technology that showcases the potential of combining digital fragments into a holistic piece of work. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-fhi88"><span><span>One of the most exciting aspects of creative coding is that it’s so readily available. Regardless of where you go in the world, there will always be code present guiding new innovations or digital platforms. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-8344v"><span><span>Creative coder Zach Lieberman takes advantage of how constantly present code is in our lives by using Google Maps to create art.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get Elm with hot reloading on top of IHP, the new framework that makes Haskell a cool kid in web dev.</p><article><p><em>This is <strong>part 1</strong> of the series <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://driftercode.com/blog/ihp-with-elm-series">IHP with Elm</a></em></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> was my gateway drug into type-safe functional programming. It's such a good tool for making robust frontends. Writing big projects in React and TypeScript honestly bums me out because of it.</p><p>I have always wanted have to have the equivalent type-safe joy on the backend like I have with Elm.</p><p>Now I have it all, with SSR included and an amazing developer experience 😍</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a> is a new web framework that has opened a wide door for the web development community to get into Haskell.</strong> Like Rails and Laravel, it's great for quick prototyping, well documented and easy to use.</p><p>It even has the pipe operator (<code>|&gt;</code>) included making it even more similar to the Elm syntax.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: This tutorial should work for Mac and Linux. If you develop on Windows, it might not work without some tweaks on your own</strong></p><h2>Create a new IHP Project</h2><p>If you haven't installed IHP already, make sure you do. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/installation.html">It's surprisingly easy to get going</a>.</p><p>Start a fresh IHP project for this tutorial. Luckily, it couldn't be easier as soon as IHP is properly installed.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>To verify the app is working, cd into the <code>ihp-with-elm</code> folder and run <code>./start</code>.</p><h2>Update .gitignore</h2><p>Let's update <code>.gitignore</code> as soon as possible to avoid pushing unwanted stuff into git.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><h2>Initialize node and elm</h2><p>In your <code>default.nix</code> file in the root folder, add <code>Node.js</code> and <code>elm</code> to <code>otherDeps</code>:</p><code-editor language="nix"></code-editor><p>To update your local environment, close the server <strong>(ctrl+c)</strong> and run</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>Then initialize Node.js and elm at the project root.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>For this tutorial, we will rename the <code>src</code> folder that elm generated into <code>elm</code>.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>Set the source directories folder to <strong>"elm"</strong> in <code>elm.json</code>.</p><code-editor language="json"></code-editor><h2>Getting the Haskell template ready</h2><p>Let's start writing the Elm entrypoint into the Haskel template.</p><p>Go to <code>Web/View/Static/Welcome.hs</code> and replace all the html inside the HSX in <code>VelcomeView</code>:</p><code-editor language="hs"></code-editor><p>If your IHP app is not already running, run it with <code>./start</code> and see the output on <code>localhost:8000</code>.</p><p><img src="https://driftercode.com/images/archive/ihp-with-elm/elm-not-loaded.jpg" alt="Elm not running" loading="lazy"></p><p>As you see, Elm has not been loaded, because we naturally haven't written any Elm code yet. Let's close the server <strong>(ctrl+c)</strong> and do that now.</p><h2>Setting up Elm</h2><p>Install <code>node-elm-compiler</code> for compiling and <code>elm-hot</code> for hot reloading in development. <code>parcel-bundler</code> is a "zero config" JavaScript bundler.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>You could do it all without a bundler like Parcel. IHP discourages bundlers, and I agree that it's not always necessary.</p><p>Still, Parcel provides valuable niceties like tight production minification and good hot reloading in development, so I prefer to use Parcel when things get a bit more advanced.</p><p>Create <code>index.js</code> and <code>Main.elm</code> in the elm folder:</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>The <code>elm/index.js</code> should look like this to initialize the Elm file.</p><code-editor language="javascript"></code-editor><p>Finally, lets' insert the code for <code>elm/Main.elm</code>!</p><code-editor language="elm"></code-editor><p>Add the scripts for building the app both in production and development into <code>package.json</code>:</p><p>Then replace the <code>start</code> script in <code>package.json</code> and add accordingly:</p><code-editor language="json"></code-editor><p>With that you can now run both the IHP app and the JavaScript simultaneously with this single command in development.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>And quit with <strong>(ctrl+c)</strong> as always.</p><p>There you should have it! Elm in Haskell with hot reloading and the Elm debugger is ready for you in the bottom right corner. Beautiful!</p><p><img src="https://driftercode.com/images/archive/ihp-with-elm/elm-loaded.jpg" alt="Elm running" loading="lazy"></p><h2>Build for production</h2><p>When pushing your IHP app to production, you need to make sure that it builds the Elm applications.</p><p>Go to the <code>Makefile</code> in the project root and remove all unused JavaScript files until these are your only <code>JS_FILES</code>:</p><code-editor language="makefile"></code-editor><p>We're keeping <code>flatpickr</code> because we are using the datepicker, but other than that, Turbolinks seems to complicate the Elm loading and jQuery gives us nothing Elm can't give us.</p><p>We're keeping bootstrap css just so we don't need to do any styling for this tutorial.</p><p>Put this code at the bottom of the <code>Makefile</code> to build Elm in production.</p><code-editor language="makefile"></code-editor><p>It should now be ready to ship to production for example to IHP Cloud.</p><p>For a complete overview of what has been done, see the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/kodeFant/ihp-with-elm/compare/1-initial...2-ihp-with-elm">diff from a fresh IHP install</a>.</p><h2>Things I don't use Elm for in IHP</h2><p>IHP gives you HTML templating (HSX) with pure functions, very similar to Elm. In that regard it's partially overlapping with Elm.</p><p>It can be a blurry line for beginners, so here are my recommendations for how to set those lines.</p><ul><li>Use HSX for <strong>basic HTML</strong>, even if it requires a couple of lines of JavaScript. I would for example write a basic hamburger menu in HSX/HTML.</li><li>Use HSX for <strong>forms</strong>. Forms are pretty much always a bigger pain written in app code. If you have been living in the Single Page App world for a while, you will realize forms written in normal HTML is not that bad. IHP gives you a convenient way of writing forms with server-side validation.</li><li>Use Elm for the <strong>advanced UI stuff</strong> requiring heavy use of DOM manipulation. Elm shines in writing user interfaces with high complexity. If the lines of JavaScript are getting too many, turn to Elm!</li><li>Do you want the content to have <strong>SSR</strong> for search engine optimization? Use HSX.</li></ul><p>So unless you really want to write a full Single Page App, Elm should be used with restraint in IHP, for only specific supercharged parts of the site.</p><p><strong>Most sites are actually better off outputting just HTML and CSS.</strong></p><h2>Next up</h2><p>I want to take this application further in future posts showing you how to interact between IHP and Elm, and how use Elm within protected boundaries (requiring authentication). <a href="https://driftercode.com/blog/passing-flags-from-ihp-to-elm">Read on to part 2 if these are topics that intrigue you 😊</a></p></article></div>]]>

<h4>Summary </h4>
<p> HF Radios are important for military communications. IP is widely used       
  and is the basis for most network communication. This paper looks at         
use of IP over HF Radio and the efficiency of different types of application     
    over IP. The key findings are:                   </p>
<ul>
  <li>That IP can be operated over HF Radio, and that doing so may be            
   useful, particularly to enable support of applications that are only          
     available to run over IP.</li>
  <li> That most IP based applications running over a HF link will make          
     very inefficient use of the HF link, and that direct application use        
       of the HF link using STANAG 5066 will give much better 
performance.</li></ul>
<p>This paper concludes that applications intended for regular use over          
 HF Radio should not use IP and should instead be directly integrated           
with STANAG 5066.</p></blockquote-wp>
<h2>IP</h2>
<p>IP (Internet Protocol) is the basis of the Internet, and the most widely      
     used protocol. It supports a number of transports, including TCP, UDP       
    and RTP, and a myriad of end applications. IP is the universal interface     
      between physical networks and application. Application writers develop     
      to IP, or to one of the standardized protocols or middleware systems       
    that run over IP. Networking technology providers seek to provide IP         
operation as a primary goal.</p>
<p>"IP Everywhere" is such a strong culture, that it is difficult           to 
appreciate the few places where IP is not the right answer. IP is           
universal and is the right answer almost all of the time. This paper           
looks at why IP is not the right solution for HF Radio. Another example          
 of where IP is not right is deep space communications, where the long  </p>
<h2>Key Factors for Good Performance over HF</h2>
<p>HF Radio is very slow with typical rates around 1200 bits per second.         
  This slow speed is usually perceived as the primary difficulty with           
using HF. For components about the modem level, speed is determined.           
There are two general issues relating to performance that are now described.</p>
<h3>Turnaround time</h3>
<p>For data applications, the most significant problem with HF is turnaround     
      time. Turnaround time is the time taken to change direction of data        
   flow, and for HF Radio this is measured in seconds or tens of seconds.        
 Turnaround time is caused by factors at multiple levels:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Modem turnaround time</li>
  <li> Interleaver completion time. This can be a significant time (e.g.,        
       2.16 seconds for STANAG 4539 short interleaver or 8.64 seconds for        
       the long interleaver).</li>
  <li> Delays due to Comsec layer.</li>
  <li> The HF Radio must switch from send to receive. (An HF Radio is            
   a simplex device, and cannot send and receive at the same time).</li>
  <li> HF Skywave latency times.</li></ol>
<p>All of this leads to a turnaround time of at least a few seconds and          
 sometimes as much as 20-30 seconds. In order to make (reasonably) efficient     
      use of an HF link, it is critical to have transmit time longer than        
   turnaround time. This has a significant impact on applications.</p>
<p>For VHF and higher frequencies, turnaround time is less, so the impact        
   is less significant. For VHF, full duplex transmission can also be used,      
     which removes the impact completely.</p>
<h3>Efficient Use of the Pipe</h3>
<p>It is important that applications use the HF link as efficiently as           
possible, as bandwidth is limited. There are a number of things that         
need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Compression. This will be important for most applications.            
   Compression is not discussed in this paper, but should be addressed           
    by applications operating over HF.</li>
  <li> Protocol and Header Overhead. It is important that protocols do           
    not consume undue bandwidth with headers and other information. This         
      should be optimized. The protocols discussed in this paper, and in         
      particular STANAG 5066 are well optimized.</li>
  <li> Grouping data. Where possible data should be sent together in long        
       transmissions, to minimize the effect of turnaround time.</li>
  <li> Avoiding repeat transmissions, except when data is lost. It is            
   clearly important that data is not sent twice when not needed, and            
   applications should be designed to avoid this.</li></ul>
<p>These last two points have potential for significant inefficiency,           
and are discussed in more detail in the context of relevant protocols.</p>
<h2>STANAG 5066</h2>
<p>STANAG 5066 is a NATO standard for running applications over HF Radio.        
   This is described in the Isode whitepaper <a href="http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/stanag-5066.html">STANAG 
          5066: The Standard for Data Applications over HF Radio.</a></p>
<p>An HF Modem provides a quite basic send/receive capability. STANAG           
5066 provides application oriented capabilities over this. Capabilities          
 of relevance to this paper:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decoupling. Data can be accepted from one or more applications,            
   and queued for sending. A STANAG 5066 server can then “fill             the 
  pipe” to avoid wasting capacity.</li>
  <li> Fragmentation. STANAG 5066 will break application data into blocks        
       appropriate for the modem speed (DPDUs). This is important both for       
        precedence handling and acknowledgement.</li>
  <li> Precedence handling. STANAG 5066 will send higher priority data           
    (DPDUs) first..</li>
  <li> Support for multicast, which can also be used to support nodes            
   in Radio Silence (also known as EMCON (Emission Control)).</li>
  <li> Reliable transmission is supported for non-multicast traffic, by          
     acknowledgement at the DPDU level. This means that when there is data       
        loss (e.g., due to Radio noise) that retransmission is of the lost       
        DPDUs. This is more efficient than application level 
retransmission.</li>
  <li> Minimizing turnarounds. STANAG 5066 has long transmit times (up           
    to 127.5 seconds) and works to maximize transmit time. Acknowledgements      
         are delayed wherever possible, so reliable transmission does not 
  increase             the number of turnarounds.</li></ol>
<p>The central service in STANAG 5066 is "unit data". This service           
allows transfer of a block of data, with a maximum size constrained           
set at the STANAG 5066 level (typically 2 kBytes). Applications using  </p>
<p>Unit data may be unacknowledged (best effort) or acknowledged (reliable).     
      The choice is made by the application using STANAG 5066. Unacknowledged    
       must be used where data is being sent to more than one recipient 
(broadcast           or multicast) or where the recipient is in EMCON (Emission 
Control)           and cannot transmit an acknowledgement.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio </h2>
<p>IP could be mapped onto HF Radio in a number of ways. There are two           
mechanisms standardized (STANAG 5066 and STANAG 4538) which are discussed        
   here. These provide similar characteristics to the IP user, and so the        
   choice of mapping does not significantly affect the analysis in this          
 paper. It is hard to conceive of alternate mappings that would lead           
to improvements.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio using STANAG 5066</h2>
<p>STANAG 5066 defines use of IP over STANAG 5066. This support is mandatory     
      in the current standard, although not all STANAG 5066 products support     
      it. The mapping is very simple: essentially an IP packet is mapped 
directly           onto STANAG 5066 unit data. There are two options for unit 
data, both         of which are valid for IP:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unreliable. This is a natural mapping for IP, as IP is defined as          
     an unreliable protocol.</li>
  <li> Reliable. This may be used for unicast and non-EMCON transmission. 
</li></ol>
<p>There are a number of factors in the choice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If data needs to be retransmitted, reliable will be more efficient,        
       as this can be done at the DPDU level, rather than forcing the 
  application             to retransmit the complete unit data.</li>
  <li> Some applications respond to lost data by either reducing transmission    
           rate, or by packet exchange which leads to more turnarounds. These    
           are both undesirable, and can be addressed by the reliable 
  option.</li>
  <li> A consequence of minimizing turnarounds is that in the event of           
    data loss, IP packets using the reliable option may be considerably          
     delayed. Some applications and operating respond badly to this delay,       
        and data may be retransmitted unnecessarily.</li></ul>
<p>This choice gives a flavor of the issues that will be examined in the         
  rest of this paper. The support of IP over HF radio is quite straightforward.  
         The issues arise from the interaction of applications using IP and 
consequences           of the underlying characteristics of HF Radio.</p>
<p>Where priority data is carried in IP, this can be mapped onto STANAG          
 5066 priority. Handling of priority at the IP level is discussed in           
the Isode whitepaper<a href="http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/low-latency.html"> 
Sending FLASH Messages             Quickly</a>.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio using STANAG 4538</h2>
<p>STANAG 4538 provides an alternate set of data link services and ARQ           
(acknowledgement mechanisms to support reliable data) to STANAG 5066.           
STANAG 4538 and associated specification is an example of 3G HF Radio.           
STANAG 4538 provides a reliable point to point data service that will           
work with very poor radio conditions. This makes it ideal for use with           
small “man pack” radios with whip aerials that will often           need to deal 
with poor signals. STANAG 4538 defines a mapping of IP           over its data 
services, which is a straightforward use of the underlying           reliable 
data transfer. It has characteristics very similar to the reliable         
mapping of STANAG 5066.</p>
<p>STANAG 5066 and associated standards is an …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>As part of my Ph.D. program in Software Engineering in the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> at <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I have to serve as a Teaching Assistant twice throughout the duration of the program.  Normally, the department requests that you serve as TA in two different classes, but under special circumstances you can TA the same course twice if you take on more responsibility in your second term.  These responsibilities effectively move you from a more traditional TA role, where you mainly hold recitation and correct assignments, to include giving lectures and be involved with part of the course delivery and design.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My first time TA’ing was for <a href="http://cmu-313.github.io/">17-313 Foundations of Software Engineering</a>, co-instructed by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/">Michael Hilton</a>, in the Fall 2019 semester.  I was selected for this TA role based on my industry experience (for those of you that don’t know, I worked many a job from 1998 - 2015 before leaving to pursue my Ph.D.) and since I was taking two courses that semester, used the TA to fill the remainder of the time while putting research off for most of the semester.  The class was sized around 32 student and it was held on campus with two recitation sections that I taught myself.  As part of this, I also delivered a single lecture on Chaos Engineering and had Tammy Butow (from Gremlin) come and give a short guest lecture to reinforce the lecture material and prepare students for an in-person class recitation on using Gremlin to put chaos into practice with the code they had been working with all semester.</p>

<p>In Spring 2020, I took CS Pedagogy at CMU, a course that is co-instructed by Michael and Charlie Garrod designed specifically for students interested in teaching.  This was a fantastic course that is only offered occasionally (and, highly recommended!) where we learned how to properly design and deliver lectures over the course of 12 weeks.  During this period, I perfected a lecture, along with several active learning activities, on Lamport and vector clocks, that I delivered as part of my final project.  However, I wanted to put into practice what I had learned in this class, so I inquired about participating in an extended TA of 17-313 where I could serve in the role as co-instructor instead of just a normal TA.</p>

<p>I was approved and it would be set that I would serve in this role for the Fall 2020 semester, in a format that none of us were prepared for: remote and hybrid learning in a quarantine setting.</p>

<h2 id="17-313-redux-fall-2020">17-313 Redux, Fall 2020</h2>

<p>Fall 2020 brought a number of changes and along with these changes came challenges.</p>

<h3 id="logistical-challenges">Logistical Challenges</h3>

<p>This year, we faced a number of new challenges around logistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, 17-313 had doubled it’s enrollment and had a waitlist. Istead of around 30 students, we’d have 60.</li>
  <li>Next, students would be participating in the course mostly online and we would be lecturing on Zoom.</li>
  <li>There wasn’t going to be another TA besides myself, because getting TA’s in a semester where many students were taking the semester off was difficult for every class at CMU.</li>
  <li>Students who didn’t travel back to Pittsburgh after the summer break would be participating remotely from wherever they were: some were in different timezones in the US, some all over the world: we had students in Africa, Singapore, and China.</li>
  <li>We would have four recitation sections.  The first would be on campus, in person, in a socially distanced setting.  The second would be hybrid, where I would Zoom from the classroom and students could come to class or participate online, and finally the final two would be completely online.  These would have to be recorded and spread over the week in between and across lectures for that week (of which, we had two.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was scary.  First off, we’re a software engineering course.  This entire course isn’t designed around writing software, it’s designed to help students learn process, collaboration, team management, the software development lifecycle, etc.  Most of our lectures involved group-based active learning activities.  Many, an overwhelming majority, of our recitation activities relied on close group work.  We’d have to make some changes.</p>

<p>It would be new, it would be difficult, it would be challenging.</p>

<p>In the section below, I’m going to briefly outline what I’m specifically proud of this semester and some of the things we learned when running this course online.</p>

<h3 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h3>

<p>We face technical challenges every year and none of these were new because of COVID-19.  However, debugging and dealing with them asynchronously was challenging in many respects.</p>

<p>Our course is designed around using Docker to run some code in a Linux environment and every semester this is a problem with Microsoft Windows.  In Fall 2019, most of the problems we ran into were around students with Mac’s that were too old (or running too outdated of an OS) to use Docker or Windows machines where Docker ran pitifully slow because of the emulation required to run Docker inside of a VirtualBox VM without hardware support (as, most of our students do NOT have Windows Professional, which was required for Hyper-V.)  In Fall 2020, we had new Docker problems where WSL2 had gone GA about 14 days before the semester, docker-machine was no longer a supported option, and students had to spent the first week upgrading Windows to a release that supported WSL2-native Docker.</p>

<p>Outside of issues of just running Docker, this issue that <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">I had been tracking for a year</a>  as I was an early WSL2 adopted on the development Insiders channel, on memory being reclaimed by WSL2 and not being released was a huge problem for students, who had to repeatedely restart WSL2 when they ran out of memory in Windows using Docker.  Further exacerbating that issue, students who had Windows Home with either 6 or 8GB of memory on their own laptops, sometimes could not even build their own Docker containers before running out of memory, leaving us with few options to help them.  Finally, several students just did not have enough disk space available.  Within the first two weeks, I spent hours a day Zoom’ing with students on screensharing to debug at least 15 or more unique environments students had trying to get them in a place where they had a working Docker configuration to be able to run the single container required for the course.</p>

<h3 id="recitation-challenges">Recitation Challenges</h3>

<p>Recitation sections also posed their own set of challenges.  I outline some of the things we learned below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We had to rethink how every recitation would work to ensure it worked in both a socially-distanced classroom as well as in a Zoom-based classroom.  We decided on the following.  First, for recitations that were purely in Zoom, we’d use breakout rooms.  However, in the classroom, students were instructed about how close they could have their desks to one another using indicators on the floor; therefore, we would have these students use a Zoom breakout room for screensharing or collaborate through a shared Google doc.  In Zoom, we’d used random assignment for breakout rooms; in the classroom, we’d use a 60 person classroom, adjusted for 20 students, to group students together based on their location in the classroom – opposite sides – so they could have actual discussions verbally.  Whereas smaller breakout rooms seemed to work for many activities on Zoom better, larger groups worked much better in the classroom.  Finally, since you don’t have the classroom to overhear how groups are working together, I needed a mechanism to gauge group progress: in Zoom, I would need to constantly move breakout room to breakout room to see how people were working, but given the delay required to switch rooms in Zoom, this was less than ideal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing we tried during lecture and recitation, was to have students collaborate on building design documents, etc. on shared Google Docs.  This worked well at first, but we soon learned that smaller breakout rooms didn’t work well: 60 students in a collaborative Google slide deck would cause Google to report that there were too many users on the same document and disable editing.  This got better once we moved to larger documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of our recitation activities relied on students working together in the classroom to build something physical (or, do physical collaboration.)  One of these was our agile activity that typically involves building paper airplanes.  I completely rewrote that recitation to work in an asynchrous format that I talked about at length in a <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/teaching/2020/12/08/agile.html">previous post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For both lectures and recitations, we learned that students would mostly arrive with cameras and mics off.  We quickly learned that students would enable them in smaller breakout rooms, and therefore pushed to use breakout rooms with active learning activities early in both recitation and lecture: students would always return with cameras on and be more willing to talk afterwards, since they would turn them on in the breakout.  For the smaller recitations (2-4 people), students would immediately turn their cameras on, which seems to indicate that students are less comfortable in the larger groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recitation sizes, arguably the most challenging aspect of running recitations in this format.  For each recitation, we had roughly 10-15 students scheduled.  However, the numbers throughout the semester varied greatly.  First, students were able to choose which recitation they attended and since they were recorded, they could also attend asynchronously.  This made week-to-week predictions of the attendence difficult.  One observation was that the students in the in-person section were relatively stable: the students who came, always came (even, when the in-person recitation section went fully remote from in-person after the Thanksgiving break, per CMU policy.)  The other recitations would flucutate between either almost all students to the smallest number I ever had in a section, two students.  This made it especially difficult for …</p></li></ul></div></div>

  <span>const</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>clicks<span>.</span>current <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>.</span>current<span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This is how this component looks like (I added a re-render button so you can
actually test it out 😄):</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p>The example below is completely interactive, try clicking the "Clicks" button and then click on "Re-render".</p></div><p>As you can see, if you click the "Clicks" button it doesn't do anything. However, after click on "Re-render", it gets updated with the number of clicks we did previously.</p><h2>Difference with a variable</h2><p>You might wonder why not just use a simple variable as the example below:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>let</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>OutsideVariableButton</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And here's an interactive example for it:</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>outside variable</span></p></div><p>The button works the same way that our previous example. However, the problem arises when you have multiple instances of the same component like the example below.

In fact, all the examples
from this article uses the same button component, so if you click the button
from the first example and then click on "re-render" on the second example, the count it is gonna be
incremented!

re-render and useRef doesn't.</p></blockquote><p>In the following example I added two buttons: one that updates its count with <code>useRef</code> and the other one with <code>useState</code>. I added some labels so you can identify them easily.</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>state</span><span>ref</span></p></div><p>You'll notice that clicking on the button with <code>useRef</code> doesn't trigger a re-render and thus, the view isn't updated. On the other side, when you click on the button that uses <code>useState</code>, it will update its clicks count immediately.</p><p>To perform imperative actions on DOM nodes, React provides a way to get a
reference to them via refs. All you have to do is to assign a <code>ref</code> property to
a node with a ref object like this:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>CustomInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>The way to get a DOM reference using refs works (informally 😅) as follows:</p><div><p><span>Today</span></p><div><p>React</p><p>Hey, what's up?<span>12:00</span></p></div><div><p>Could you give me a reference to this dom node?<span>12:00<svg style="color:#34B7F1" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg><svg style="color:#34B7F1;margin-left:-12px" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg></span></p></div><div><p>React</p><p>Sure, I assigned it to the 'current' property of your ref.<span>12:00</span></p></div></div><p>On the first render, <code>inputRef</code>'s value will be <code>{ current: null }</code> and in the
following renders it will have its <code>current</code> property assigned to the specified DOM
node:</p><p>However, if you only reference <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then it'll always
reference the DOM node so you don't need to worry about it being undefined.</p><p>Let's update our example to get an idea of how this works:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>AttachingToDomExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> inputRef <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"useEffect inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>inputRef<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the console output when rendering this component:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>Location</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: undefined }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, if you access the <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then you don't
need to worry about it being <code>undefined</code> because React will assign it
automatically for you.</p><p>Let's start with a simple real-world application for refs: <code>usePrevious</code>. This
hook stores the previous value for a given state variable.
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">It is even referenced on React's docs</a> as a way to "get the previous props or state". Let's see it in
action first:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>UsePreviousExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>clicks<span>,</span> setClicks<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  
  <span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span>clicks<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setClicks</span><span>(</span>clicks <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>}</span><span> - Before: </span><span>{</span>previousClicks<span>}</span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the output so you can play with it:</p><p>You can notice that the <code>previousClicks</code> variable stores the value for the previous render
for a given variable. Here's its implementation:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> value
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Let's analyze how it works.</p><p>Let's simulate what happens on the first render. We can remove the call to
<code>useEffect</code> since it doesn't affect the return value on the first render:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>On the first render it is called with a value of <code>0</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, <code>usePrevious</code> will return <code>undefined</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>After increase the value for count, here's how the <code>usePrevious</code> call will look:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>usePrevious</code> is called again, its effect needs to run:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>After this, the <code>usePrevious</code> function is called again:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And so on. Here's the value for each render for both variables:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>clicks</th><th>previousClicks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>undefined</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Callback Refs are a different way to set refs. It gives you a fine-grain control
over when refs are attached and detached because you provide a function instead
of a ref variable. This function gets called every time the component mounts and
unmounts.</p><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-ref-example-lqe8w?file=/src/App.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here's an example</a> that shows/hides an emoji every time you click its button.
The important thing here is the <code>ref</code> prop that we added. We use a function to log
the provided ref:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>callback</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"callback:"</span><span>,</span> ref<span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>show<span>,</span> setShow<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setShow</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>show<span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        </span><span>{</span>show <span>?</span> <span>"Hide"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"Show"</span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span>{</span>show <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>callback<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>👋</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's an interactive version of the previous code (you can check the output in
the console to see that I'm not lying 🙃):</p><p><em>Note: If you use callback refs as inline functions, it will be called
twice: one with <code>null</code> and another one with the DOM element.
This is because React needs to clear the previous ref every time the function is
created. A workaround for this is to use a class method.</em></p><div><h2>Warning</h2><p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">String refs</a> are a legacy feature and they are likely to be removed in future React versions.</p></div><p>The way it works is that you provide a string as a ref value like <code>ref="exampleRef"</code> and it automatically gets assigned to <code>this.refs</code>.</p><p><em>Note: String refs can only be used with class components.</em></p><p>Here's an usage example:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>App</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React<span>.</span>Component</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Labeling Problem</h2><p>The efficacy of a machine learning model is limited to the quality and quantity of data being used to train the model. The most powerful models typically require massive amounts of data to train. If the target variables in the model are categorical, there is an equally massive amount of labels in the dataset. Unfortunately, most of these labels are done by hand-- a painstakingly slow and resource intensive process. The time and resources that come with labeling datasets by hand creates inefficiencies in many machine learning pipelines. The categorical datasets that data scientists and programmers often learn from – such as those hosted on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository </a>or those preprocessed and uploaded to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> – are idealized cases that do not reflect the typical reality of handling categorical data. In these datasets, someone has already taken the time to clean and process the data, providing the labels needed to train machine models. In real-life cases, this is usually not the case.</p><p>The origin of the categorical data labels often varies with the type of data in question. For example, pattern-recognition algorithms are often trained on labels provided through crowdsourcing. An algorithm trying to distinguish dogs from cats in images relies on humans to label each image beforehand. In ambiguous images, multiple people can assign different labels, resulting in a lower confidence for each category. On the other hand, medical diagnoses are often given in degrees of confidence either by some predefined test or by the doctor themselves. Similarly, natural language processing algorithms use confidence metrics to evaluate which definition of a word to employ (and, therefore, which meaning is intended) based on the context in which it is used. Despite the apparent categorical nature to these use cases, the reality can be quite the opposite.</p><p>Common in all of these cases is the association of a <em>probability </em>with the label. Whether the probability is simply an ensemble of multiple labels or intrinsic to the labeling methodology, the machine learning algorithms that train on these datasets must be able to handle probabilistic data labels. In some sense, the probability of a label is more informative than the label itself, as it also conveys the degree of confidence for a given observation. Understanding how to take advantage of this, and which approaches to handling these probabilistic data labels produce better models is a practical skill for data scientists and programmers encountering real-world categorical datasets. Additionally, tools that speed up or automate the labeling process in the machine learning pipeline resolve the inefficiencies that come with human labeling. Programmatically labeling is one such approach to do so.</p><p>In this tutorial, I use Python to walk through several different approaches to using probabilistic data labels to train machine learning models. I use a dataset that has both probabilistic labels and true labels to show that, if the probabilistic labels are of high quality, they are more than sufficient in constructing high performance machine learning models.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To follow along with the code in this tutorial, you’ll need to have a recent version of Python installed. I use the <a href="https://anaconda.org/">Anaconda Navigator</a> for all my programming needs, but the code used in this tutorial is generalized to work with any Python 3.7 distribution. To install Anaconda, go <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">here</a>. &nbsp;You can find all of the code and data used on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/dsblendo/prob_data_labels">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>All of the packages I will be using are prebuilt into the Anaconda distribution, except for the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras package</a>. Keras provides us with the building blocks to construct our neural nets. To install for use in Anaconda, we can use <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> (you may also have to <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html">install conda-forge</a>):</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;conda install -c conda-forge keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>Alternatively, if you are using another Python distribution, you can install Keras with pip:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pip install keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>To import the necessary packages and functions that we will use, in Python run:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;<strong>import</strong> numpy <strong>as</strong> np<br><strong>import</strong> pandas <strong>as</strong> pd<br><strong>import</strong> matplotlib.pyplot <strong>as</strong> plt<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> accuracy_score<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> precision_recall_fscore_support <br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.model_selection <strong>import</strong> train_test_split<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.feature_extraction.text <strong>import</strong> TfidfVectorizer<br><strong>from</strong> keras.models <strong>import</strong> Model<br><strong>from</strong> keras <strong>import</strong> optimizers<br><strong>from</strong> keras.layers <strong>import</strong> Input, Dense, Dropout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>If any error indicates that a package cannot be found, simply install it using the same syntax as above, switching out the package name as needed. <br>‍</p><p>The data I will be working with is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam">Enron Spam classification dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset contains the text from 33,715 emails that are classified as either wanted (ham) or unwanted (spam). &nbsp;As can be seen below, the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; column contains the text of each email. We will use this text to train our model to classify the email as either ham or spam. </p><p>The &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column contains the ‘gold’ labels included in the original <em>.csv</em> file from Kaggle: 0 for ham and 1 for spam. There is an additional column that is not in the original Kaggle dataset: the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Pred&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;<em> </em>column<em>.</em> This column contains probabilistic labels from 0 to 100 (rather than the binary labels in the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column) that indicate the probability of each email belonging to the spam class. </p><p>These probabilities were programmatically labeled using <a href="https://www.watchful.io/">Watchful</a>, without looking at the original gold labels. It would take days for a human to label each email to by hand, while Watchful accomplished this in around 3 hours. &nbsp; </p><p>To import the dataset, we can use the<em> </em>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; package:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;file_path = 'watchful_export.csv'<br>email_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)<br>email_df.head()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>The output should look something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c4e081336a4_lMVu2dmf4RMJnd1IEucaulz17cuRIdK4qweUknWLuduEplP55gg4a9TYNu-OtnZW5uvadw8pTtl3fFnq3gPXhlkg4zbzD2azXTUmdcV5YOBF1R5BYANjItlhYmXjNmjbbkUR0zJD.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>All set? Let’s go.</p><h2>Exploring the Data</h2><p>Before we get to the model implementation, it is always a good idea to explore the data we are working with. We can also compare the probabilistic data labels provided by Watchful with the original gold labels and evaluate how well the algorithm did. In most real-life cases, this is not possible, as the true labels are either limited to a few observations, not known at all, or have poor quality. </p><p>First, it is worth looking at the distribution of spam and ham emails in the gold labels and the probabilistic labels. This gives us an idea of the balance of the dataset, as well as how well the probabilistic labels match up to the gold labels. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;gold_col_name = 'Spam_Gold'<br>pred_col_name = 'Spam_Pred'<br>text_col_name = 'Text'<br>pct_spam = email_df[gold_col_name].sum() / email_df.shape[0]<br>pct_ham = 1 - pct_spam<br>pct_spam, pct_ham&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c78a41336c8_VtYibTj6IYwpv8vQnofsEzLXZknIAdMi-NyTfM8ep6hDCBAIm1-nF7ZJGwK2hGhgq-Kv2n4XKObnIri8Nd9vTg8g8Jocgok0BPzgRvey6eUbl1xuCBdEanlQdeESi2KdGvf7yHlK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>So, the dataset has nearly an equal distribution of spam and ham emails. Dealing with sparse data is not trivial for most machine learning algorithms. Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about it. As, expected, the histogram of gold labels is nearly equal in height:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[gold_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c35f4133692__jnMfpcDBpKOL_PUwnyz0kWOWBaZaRA2v8hf5CsFdfQBMSTqqmR7qFd2chzDdjsKYgwmaUqsF_EZ_wPPfgxwp-Ylb0Y6IW8y8XqSSVaEPKIk63E6mKwMKt2rC4cdQXP9nrCRJ-Fp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And for the probabilistic labels:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[pred_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551ccb721336ec_fcbwX4G08cR9jGH2dHljz611Pmh4PXe1xLE_1hRmApL3Bx-qTG5nMZwTQS9g141qSpW2Bk6JktXXrvBjayV8Hw41vqpGso3MBR8Hi8Lni2nwtlaObjuu2IbQKwr_Y6NCP_Hs-dGc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distributions are pretty similar. This is an indication that the probabilistic labels assigned by Watchful are well aligned with the gold labels – a promising sign for being solely generated by the email text. </p><p>‍</p><p>From a qualitative perspective, certain characteristics of the emails are bound to correlate with either being spam or ham. For example, one could imagine that curt, plain text is probably not an advertisement for some product and is therefore an indicator of a ham email. On the other hand, text that is long and superfluous is generally more common in advertisements, and may indicate a spam email. </p><p>To get an idea of the distribution of the number of words used in the emails, we can take advantage of Python’s list comprehension syntax:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;lengths = np.array([len(doc.split()) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])<br>pd.DataFrame(lengths).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c243c1336b6_EYN_5xU56hJ15QgNOLP3EmEqd6gF-mP-PgWbdv-JyDiBLvPYUFapSe0m5yP1tZ_gS-OeoWU-JQrhyjCf04-MSbqO0DO30rd-X22ToTLL8M9bcYFkRTxlua8mGFmeB31oa226knO9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And to visualize the email length distribution:</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(lengths[lengths &lt; 1000])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c99b21336da_yrc6gT2jZBziyvh20WyReaApqY-f8qhxSmFPhCQCQI6wuX7bouHAKja3bGZlMy8knBZcVrh-9Qtlgnmc6GWxyv61Fz5YEGbK5DniKzEJmf7_wLRdUg3eSbGHnqk8JbGX-od97H__.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is heavily skewed, as expected for a text-based communication medium – most emails are relatively short, and the probability of a longer email scales inversely with the length.

		<h2>Passing of a Great Mind</h2>
<h3>John von Neumann, a Brilliant, Jovial Mathematician, was a Prodigious Servant of Science and his Country</h3>
<p><em>by Clary Blair Jr</em>. –&nbsp;<em>Life Magazine</em>&nbsp;(February 25th, 1957)</p>
<p>The world lost one of its greatest scientists when Professor John von Neumann, 54, died this month of cancer in Washington, D.C. His death, like his life’s work, passed almost unnoticed by the public. But scientists throughout the free world regarded it as a tragic loss. They knew that Von Neumann’s brilliant mind had not only advanced his own special field, pure mathematics, but had also helped put the West in an immeasurably stronger position in the nuclear arms race. Before he was 30 he had established himself as one of the world’s foremost mathematicians. In World War II he was the principal discoverer of the implosion method, the secret of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The government officials and scientists who attended the requiem mass at the Walter Reed Hospital chapel last week were there not merely in recognition of his vast contributions to science, but also to pay personal tribute to a warm and delightful personality and a selfless servant of his country.</p>
<p>For more than a year Von Neumann had known he was going to die. But until the illness was far advanced he continued to devote himself to serving the government as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to which he was appointed in 1954. A telephone by his bed connected directly with his EAC office. On several occasions he was taken downtown in a limousine to attend commission meetings in a wheelchair. At Walter Reed, where he was moved early last spring, an Air Force officer, Lieut. Colonel Vincent Ford, worked full time assisting him. Eight airmen, all cleared for top secret material, were assigned to help on a 24-hour basis. His work for the Air Force and other government departments continued. Cabinet members and military officials continually came for his advice, and on one occasion Secretary of Defence Charles Wilson, Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles and most of the top Air Force brass gathered in Von Neumann’s suite to consult his judgement while there was still time. So relentlessly did Von Neumann pursue his official duties that he risked neglecting the treatise which was to form the capstone of his work on the scientific specialty, computing machines, to which he had devoted many recent years.</p>

<p>His fellow scientists, however, did not need any further evidence of Von Neumann’s rank as a scientist – or his assured place in history. They knew that during World War II at Los Alamos Von Neumann’s development of the idea of implosion speeded up the making of the atomic bomb by at least a full year. His later work with electronic computers quickened U.S. development of the H-bomb by months. The chief designer of the H-bomb, Edward Teller, once said with wry humor that Von Neumann was “one of those rare mathematicians who could descend to the level of the physicist.” Many theoretical physicists admit that they learned more from Von Neumann in methods of scientific thinking than from any of their colleagues. Hans Bethe, who was director of the theoretical physics division at Los Alamos, says, “I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like Von Neumann’s does not indicate a species superior to that of man.”</p>

<p>The foremost authority on computing machines in the U.S., Von Neumann was more than anyone else responsible for the increased use of the electronic “brains” in government and industry. The machine he called MANIAC (mathematical analyzer, numerical integrator and computer), which he built at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., was the prototype for most of the advanced calculating machines now in use. Another machine, NORC, which he built for the Navy, can deliver a full day’s weather prediction in a few minutes. The principal adviser to the U.S. Air Force on nuclear weapons, Von Neumann was the most influential scientific force behind the U.S. decision to embark on accelerated production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. His “theory of games,” outlined in a book which he published in 1944 in collaboration with Economist Oskar Morgenstern, opened up an entirely new branch of mathematics. Analyzing the mathematical probabilities behind games of chance, Von Neumann went on to formulate a mathematical approach to such widespread fields as economics, sociology and even military strategy. His contributions to the quantum theory, the theory which explains the emission and absorption of energy in atoms and the one on which all atomic and nuclear physics are based, were set forth in a work entitled <em>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics</em>&nbsp;which he wrote at the age of 23. It is today one of the cornerstones of this highly specialized branch of mathematical thought.</p>
<p>For Von Neumann the road to success was a many-laned highway with little traffic and no speed limit. He was born in 1903 in Budapest and was of the same generation of <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/">Hungarian physicists</a> as Edward Teller, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner, all of whom later worked on atomic energy development for the U.S.</p>
<p>The eldest of three sons of a well-to-do Jewish financier who had been decorated by the Emperor Franz Josef, John von Neumann grew up in a society which placed a premium on intellectual achievement. At the age of 6 he was able to divide two eight-digit numbers in his head. By the age of 8 he had mastered college calculus and as a trick could memorize on sight a column in a telephone book and repeat back the names, addresses and numbers. History was only a “hobby,” but by the outbreak of World War I, when he was 10, his photographic mind had absorbed most of the contents of the 46-volume works edited by the German historian Oncken with a sophistication that startled his elders.</p>
<p>Despite his obvious technical ability, as a young man Von Neumann wanted to follow his father’s financial career, but he was soon dissuaded. Under a kind of supertutor, a first-rank mathematician at the University of Budapest named Leopold Fejer, Von Neumann was steered into the academic world. At 21 he received two degrees – one in chemical engineering at Zurich and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Budapest. The following year, 1926, as Admiral Horthy’s rightist regime had been repressing Hungarian Jews, he moved to Göttingen, Germany, then the mathematical center of the world. It was there that he published his major work on quantum mechanics.</p>
<h4>The young professor</h4>
<p>His fame now spreading, Von Neumann at 23 qualified as a <em>Privatdozent</em>&nbsp;(lecturer) at the University of Berlin, one of the youngest in the school’s history. But the Nazis had already begun their march to power. In 1929 Von Neumann accepted a visiting lectureship at Princeton University and in 1930, at the age of 26, he took a job there as professor of mathematical physics – after a quick trip to Budapest to marry a vivacious 18-year-old named Mariette Kovesi. Three years later, when the Institute for Advanced Study was founded at Princeton, Von Neumann was appointed – as was Albert Einstein – to be one of its first full professors. “He was so young,” a member of the institute recalls, “that most people who saw him in the halls mistook him for a graduate student.”</p>

<p>Although they worked near each other in the same building, Einstein and Von Neumann were not intimate, and because their approach to scientific matters was different they never formally collaborated. A member of the institute who worked side by side with both men in the early days recalls, “Einstein’s mind was slow and contemplative. He would think about something for years. Johnny’s mind was just the opposite. It was lightning quick – stunningly fast. If you gave him a problem he either solved it right away or not at all. If he had to think about it a long time and it bored him, hist interest would begin to wander. And Johnny’s mind would not shine unless whatever he was working on had his undivided attention.” But the problems he did care about, such as his “theory of games,” absorbed him for much longer periods.</p>
<h4>‘Proof by erasure’</h4>
<p>Partly because of this quicksilver quality Von Neumann was not an outstanding teacher to many of his students. But for the advanced students who could ascend to his level he was inspirational. His lectures were brilliant, although at times difficult to follow because of his way of erasing and rewriting dozens of formulae on the blackboard. In explaining mathematical problems Von Neumann would write his equations hurriedly, starting at the top of the blackboard and working down. When he reached the bottom, if the problem was unfinished, he would erase the top equations and start down again. By the time he had done this two or three times most other mathematicians would find themselves unable to keep track. On one such occasion a colleague at Princeton waited until Von Neumann had finished and said, “I see. Proof by erasure.”</p>
<p>Von Neumann himself was perpetually interested in many fields unrelated to science. Several years ago his wife gave him a 21-volume Cambridge History set, and she is sure he memorized every name and fact in the books. “He is a major expert on all the royal family trees in Europe,” a friend said once. “He can tell you who fell in love with whom, and why, what obscure cousin this or that czar married, how many illegitimate children he had and so on.” One night during the Princeton days a world-famous expert on Byzantine history came to the Von Neumann house for a party. “Johnny and the professor got into a corner and began discussing some obscure facet,” recalls a friend who was there. “Then an argument arose over a date. Johnny insisted it was this, the professor that. So Johnny said, ‘Let’s get the book.’ They looked it up and Johnny was right. A few weeks later the professor was invited to the Von Neumann house again. He called Mrs. von Neumann and said jokingly, ‘I’ll come if Johnny promises not to discuss Byzantine history. …</p></div></div>

All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all.

        <p>Published on: 2020-12-16</p>
        
<p>I'm going to consider a fairly unpopular idea: most efforts towards "explainable AI" are essentially pointless. Useful as an academic pursuit and topic for philosophical debate, but not much else.</p>
<p>Consider this article a generator of interesting intuitions and viewpoints, rather than an authoritative take-down of explainability techniques.</p>
<p>That disclaimer aside:</p>
<hr>
<p>What if almost every problem for which it is desirable to use machine learning is unexplainable?</p>
<p>At least unexplainable in an efficient-enough way to be worth explaining. Whether it is an algorithm or a human that is doing the explanation.</p>
<p>Let's define "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a>" in a semi-narrow sense, inspired by the DARPA definition, as an inference system that can answer the questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was that prediction made as a function of our inputs and their interactions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under what conditions would the outcome differ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How confident can we be in this prediction and why is the confidence such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why might we be unable to answer the above questions in a satisfactory manner for most machine learning algorithms? I think I can name four chief reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some problems are just too complex to explain. Often enough, these are perfect problems for machine learning, it's exactly their intractability to our brains that makes them ideal for equation-generating algorithms to solve.</li>
<li>Some problems, while not that complex, are really boring and no human wants or should be forced to understand them.</li>
<li>Some problems can be understood, but understanding in itself is different for every single one of us, and people's culture and background often influence what "understanding" means. So explainable for one person is not explainable for another.</li>
<li>Even given an explanation that everyone agrees on, this usually puts us no closer to most of what we want to achieve with said explanation, things like gathering better data or removing "biases" from our models.</li>
</ol>
<h2>I - Unexplainable due to complexity</h2>
<p>Let's say, physicists, take in 100 PetaBytes of experimental data, reduce them using equations, and claim with a high probability that there exists this thing called a "Higgs Boson" with implications for how gravity works, among other things.</p>
<p>The resulting Boson can probably be defined within a few pages of text via things such as mass, the things it decays into, its charge, its spin, the various interactions it can have with other particles, and so on.</p>
<p>But if a luddite like myself asks the physicists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you predict this fundamental particle exists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will either get a "press conference answer" which carries no meaning other than providing a "satisfying" feeling, but it doesn't answer any of the above questions.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me why the data shows the existence of the Higgs Boson, it doesn't tell me how the data could have been different in order for this not to be the case, and it doesn't tell me how confident they are in this inference and why.</p>
<p>If I press for an answer that roughly satisfies the explainability criteria I mentioned above, I will at best get them to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, the standard model is a fairly advanced concept in physics, so you first have to understand that and why it came to be. Then you have to understand the experimental statistics needed to interpret the kind of data we work with here. In the process, you'll obviously learn quantum mechanics, but to understands the significance of the Higgs boson specifically it's very important that you have an amazing grasp of general relativity, since part of the reason we defined it as is and why it's so relevant is because it might be a unifying link between the two theories. Depending on how smart you are this might take 6 to 20 years to wrap your head around, really you won't even be the same person by the time you're done with this. And oh, once you get your Ph.D. and work with us for half a decade there's a chance you'll disagree with your statistics and our model and might think that we are wrong, which is fine, but in that case, you will find the explanation unsatisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are fine with this, since physics is bound to be complex, it earns its keep by being useful and making predictions about very specific things with very tight error margins, its fundamental to all other areas of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>When we say that we "understand" physics what we really mean is that there are a few dozen of thousands of blokes that spent half their lives turning their brains into hyper-optimized physics-thinking machines and they assure us that they "understand" it.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the edges of physics are a black box, I know physics works because Nvidia sells me GPUs with more VRAM each year and I'm able to watch videos of nuclear reactors glowing on youtube while patients in the nearby oncology ward are getting treated with radiation therapy.</p>
<p>This is true for many complex areas, we "understand" them because a few specialists say they do, and the knowledge that trickles down from those specialists has results that are obvious to all. Or, more realistically, because a dozen-domain long chain of specialists combined, each relying on the other, is able to produce results that are obvious to all.</p>
<p>As long as there is a group of specialist that understands the field, as long as those specialists can prove to us that their discoveries can affect the real world (thus excluding groups of well-synchronized insane people) and as long as they can teach other people to understand the field... we claim that it's "understood".</p>
<hr>
<p>But what about a credit risk analysis "AI" making a prediction that we should loan Steve at most 14,200$?</p>
<p>The model making this prediction might be operating with TBs worth of data about Steve, his browsing history, his transaction history, his music preferences, a video of him walking into the bank... each time he walked into the bank for the last 20 years, various things data aggregators tell us about him, from his preference about clothing to the likelihood he wants to buy an SUV, and of course, the actual stated purpose Steve gave us for the credit, both in text and as a video recording.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the "AI" has been trained on previous data from millions of people similar to Steve and the outcomes of the loans handed to then, thus working with petabytes of data in order to draw the 1-line conclusion of "You should loan steve, at most, 14,200$, if you want to probabilistically make a profit".</p>
<p>If we ask the AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is the maximum loan 14,200$? How did the various inputs and their interactions contribute to coming up with this number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the real answer is probably something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, I can explain this to you, but 314,667,344,401 parameters had a significant role in coming up with this number, and if you want to "truly" understand that then you'd have to understand my other 696,333,744,001 parameters and the ways they related to each other in the equation. In order to do this, you have to gain an understanding of human-gate analysis as well as how its progress over time relates to life-satisfaction, credit history analysis, shopping preference analysis, error theory behind the certainty of said shopping preferences, and about 100 other mini-models that end up coalescing into the broader model that gave this prediction. And the way they "coalesce" is even more complex than any of the individual models. You can probably do this given 10 or 20 years, but basically, you'd have to re-train your brain from scratch to be like an automated risk analyst, you'd only be able to explain this to another automated risk analysts, and the "you" "understanding" my decision will be quite different from the "you" that is currently asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even the above is an optimist take assuming the "AI" is made of multiple modules that are somewhat explainable.</p>
<p>So, is the "AI" unexplainable here?</p>
<p>Well, not more so than the physicists are. Both of them can, in theory, explain the reasoning behind their choice. But in both cases, the reasoning is not simple, there's no single data point that is crucial, if even a few inputs were to change slightly the outcome might be completely different, but the input space is so fast it's impossible to reason about all significant changes to it.</p>
<p>This is just the way things are in physics and it might be just the way things are in credit risk analysis. After all, there's no fundamental rule of the universe saying it should be easy to comprehend by the human mind. The reason this is more obvious in physics is simply because physicists have been gathering loads of data for a long time. But it might be equally true in all other fields of inquiry, based on current models, it probably is. It's just that those other fields didn't have enough data nor the intelligence required to grok through it until recently.</p>
<h2>II - Some problems are boring</h2>
<p>There is a class of problems that is complex, but not as complex as to be impenetrable to the vast majority of human minds.</p>
<p>To harken back to the physics example, think classical mechanics. Given the observations made by Galileo and some training in analysis, most of us could, in principle, understand classical mechanics.</p>
<p>But this is still difficult, it requires a lot of background knowledge, although fairly common and useful background knowledge and a significant amount of times. Ranging from, say, a day to several months depending on the person.</p>
<p>This is time well spent learning classical mechanics, but what if the problem domain was something else, say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out if a blotch on a dental CT scan is more likely to indicate a streptococcus or a lactobacillus infection.</li>
<li>Understanding what makes an image used to advertise a hiking pole attractive to middle-class Slovenians over the age of 54.</li>
<li>Figuring out, using l2 data, if the spread for the price of soybean oil is too wide, and whether the bias is towards the sell or buy.</li>
<li>Finding the optimal price at which to pre-sell a new brand of luxury sparkling water based on yet uncertain …</li></ul></div></div>

    <p>In the fall of 2020 we hosted our very first public version of <a href="https://code.sgo.to/2020/06/03/chrome-university-design-patterns.html">Chrome University</a>!</p>

<p>The event happened online for 3 mornings in 3 parallel tracks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#day-1">Day 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="#day-2">Day 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="#day-3">Day 3</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We also hosted the ChromeOS track in the afternoons, and you can find the videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u11lbUWEeYI&amp;list=PL9ioqAuyl6ULp1f36EEjIN1vSBEfsb-0a&amp;index=2">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can find past editions <a href="https://code.sgo.to/2020/06/03/chrome-university-design-patterns.html#past-editions">here</a>!</p>

<p>With that, here is the schedule:</p>
