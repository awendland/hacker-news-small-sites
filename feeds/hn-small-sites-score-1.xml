                    <p>From experimentation to production the road ahead is not paved. While trial and error is the essence of the Data Scientist's life, critical AI systems need clarity. For example, if you built a credit scoring AI that automatically grants loans to your customers, you need to understand how it makes decisions about who should or shouldn't receive a loan. This is the data scientist's job to ensure transparency, but it's not self-evident.</p><p>For a data scientist, a typical workflow looks like the this: You find a dataset, explore it in a notebook, try modeling techniques, fail, repeat ... until it works. After hours of adding new elements to a project, it's not uncommon finding oneself with a sprawling monster of data sources, notebooks and CSVs. That's when you start asking yourself, how do I put that in production? The "mess", that is an inherent part of the data exploration and modeling process, now prevents for a smooth transition of the project to production. Progress starts to stall and time to production keeps getting longer. To add to the pressure, your boss wants your solution live before the end of the week. But what took months of iterations and back and forth won't magically turn into production code. It's a problem that engineers know too well: avoiding technical debt by refactoring legacy code. Messy and hard-to-understand systems are not only a technical challenge, they routinely impact &nbsp;the bottom line of companies big and small (<a href="https://www.deepflow.ai/designing-trustworthy-ai/">read our article on Explainable AI</a>). Needless to say, you need to clean up the mess.</p><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/maneuver-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/maneuver-2.jpg 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/maneuver-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>From Jupyter notebook to production, an allegory.</figcaption></figure><p>The hand-off of projects from "research" scientists to the "production" engineers is more standardized in large companies where R&amp;D is its own entity and processes are in place to facilitate communication. Data teams in small organizations bear the brunt of limited resources and short development cycles which adds even more pressure to avoid "messy" projects.</p><blockquote>(In Enterprise AI) The most exciting problems yet to be solved are in the deployment and serving space. One reason for the lack of serving solutions is the lack of communication between researchers and production engineers. At companies that can afford to pursue AI research (e.g. big companies), the research team is separated from the deployment team, and the two teams only communicate via the p-managers: product managers, program managers, project managers. Small companies, whose employees can see the entire stack, are constrained by their immediate product needs. Only a few startups, usually those founded by accomplished researchers with enough funding to hire accomplished engineers, have managed to bridge the gap. These startups are poised to take a big chunk of the AI tooling market. <strong>Chip Huyen - "<a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html">What I learned from looking at 200 machine learning tools</a>"</strong></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/stuck-1.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Putting your AI models in production</figcaption></figure><h2 id="moving-ai-in-production">Moving AI in production</h2><p>In the software industry, the practice of managing the communication and hand offs between Developer and IT Operations is called DevOps. In practical terms, DevOps refers to the collection of industry practices that standardize how code is created, delivered, deployed and maintained in a consistent way from start to finish within a same team. It introduces two foundational concepts: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). While CI automates the building, packaging and testing of applications, CD automates the delivery of the applications to the different environments (e.g. development, testing, production).</p><p>Data Science works in a very similar way. After all, it's another flavor of software engineering. But because of some of the differences we discussed in the previous part DevOps principles cannot be transposed exactly in the same way. That's why DataOps is gaining interest in the industry, it goes beyond DevOps to offer a tailored approach to manage Data Science projects and avoid the "mess" from start to finish.</p><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png 1000w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>DevOps vs. DataOps - <a href="https://datakitchen.io/dataops-cookbook-second-edition.html">The DataOps Cookbook 2nd Ed.</a></figcaption></figure><p>The main reason for DataOps as a separate approach is that contrary to traditional engineering teams, Data Science teams are often composed of many non-engineer types, like analysts or research-focused data scientists. Their skill-set is different from engineers. Their goal is not push production-ready code but to find how data can be leveraged to answer specific problems, explore datasets to find answers, and build predictive models. Their focus is only on improving the accuracy of their models and producing actionable visualizations. </p><p>Another differentiating aspect is the range of tools used. The typical mindset of an engineering team is &nbsp;to create a standardized "sandbox" (isolated development environment to qualify code before pushing it to production) for every engineer in the team. When working on the same projects, every engineer sandbox will look exactly the same to make sure individual changes can be merged easily, thus speeding up development time and improving the quality of the overall code-base. In the context of data teams, creating a standardized environment is much more challenging. Data scientists and analysts tend to use their own tools. The exploratory nature of their work makes it almost a necessity. In this context, we prefer to talk about "orchestration" rather than "building" (see previous graph).</p><p>In conclusion, while DevOps deals with managing the complexity of the engineering life-cycle through centralization (aka. one DevOps team per company), DataOps aims to manage the freedom of Data Science through orchestration (aka. data teams are local and are distributed across the oragnization).</p><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 1000w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 1600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 1832w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning end-to-end process - <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html#cd4ml-end-to-end.png">CD4ML</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-future-of-enterprise-ai-business-leaders-with-ai-skills">The future of Enterprise AI: business leaders with AI skills</h2><p>As highlighted in the graph below, the biggest change in AI is happening behind the curtain.

</blockquote>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Previously we took a look at <a href="https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-Android/">Snapchat’s root detection methods on Android</a>. This time we are taking a look at how they detect jailbreaks, tweaks and hooks on iOS.</p>



<p>All the research in this post is based on Snapchat 10.65.0.66 (832559634).</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_login_message.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>This is the message you see when you try to login with a detected tweak, although not all tweaks trigger this message. Two examples that trigger this message are <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.johncoates.flex3/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9baacc/release_wraith_snapchatphantom_replacement/">Wraith</a>. Some just flag your account and will get you banned later in a ban wave if you are unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-bans">Avoiding bans</h2>

<p>So obviously the first thing we want to look at is, what has the community tried so far to stay hidden? If you google around a bit you will most likely end up with these result. For a few of them, I will list the most notable features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NoSub (or variants)
    <ul>
      <li>Disable Cydia Substrate / Substitute entirely for specific apps.</li>
      <li>Only if you can find an updated version and don’t want to use tweaks on Snapchat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NepetaDev/UnSub/blob/master/Tweak/Tweak.xm">UnSub</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Hooks and filters libc file system calls.</li>
      <li>Spoofs the libc getenv to remove the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> variable.</li>
      <li>Spoofs <code>_dyld_image_count</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name</code> to hide tweak related dylibs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/blob/master/Tweak.xm">Shadow</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Too much to list.. it hooks way too much.</li>
      <li>Still misses lots of stuff for Snapchat specifically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/jailbroken-iphone">Snapchat themselves recommend NoSub</a>..</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_snapchat_jailbroken_support.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>But it seems that nobody knows what Snapchat is <strong>exactly</strong> doing to detect everything. Which is why I am writing this post. Only one that I have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/cokepokes/status/1023114963550797824">publicly making efforts</a> to figure this out is the developer of Phantom, CokePokes.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-they-doing-it">How are they doing it?</h2>

<p>I will try my best to explain every check they do in Snapchat 10.65.0.66.</p>

<p>When you launch the app they create a new thread using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</a> that runs all the checks. At the end of these checks an integer is stored with flags of everything that was detected on the device. Some of these checks are then ran every 31 seconds.</p>

<p>All the code executed for these checks is obfuscated with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strong-codes">Snapchats in-house obfuscation tools</a> and thus very annoying to look at using tools such as IDA.</p>

<h3 id="code-signature-checks">Code signature checks</h3>

<p>One of the first things they do is checking and storing stuff from the code signature. This happens using the <code>sys_csops(169)</code> syscall, which is pretty much undocumented but is very similar to the code here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They execute the following operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_ENTITLEMENTS_BLOB</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important one of this is the <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code>, this retrieves the current codesigning status of the process. A jailbroken device can respond with messy status flags. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_INSTALLER</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_PLATFORM_BINARY</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DEBUGGED</code> (Process was debugged / is being debugged)</li>
  <li>Or missing <code>CS_VALID</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A normal device would have these flags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_VALID</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_HARD</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_KILL</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_ENFORCEMENT</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_REQUIRE_LV</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DYLD_PLATFORM</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_SIGNED</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For all available flags and their descriptions, see <a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/BUILD/obj/EXPORT_HDRS/osfmk/kern/cs_blobs.h.html#_M/CS_VALID">this page</a>.</p>

<p>The result of <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code> and <code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code> are stored and later sent to the Snapchat servers, encrypted.</p>

<h3 id="bundle-check">Bundle check</h3>

<p>This is a simple check but quite effective if not noticed by a tweak developer. Pseudo code looks like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 = CFBundleGetMainBundle()
x1 = CFBundleGetIdentifier(x0)
x2 = CFStringGetCStringPtr(x1)
strncmp("com.toyopagroup.picaboo", x2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dyld-check">Dyld check</h3>

<p>Snapchat has two methods to iterate all loaded dylibs.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h4>

<p>One way is using <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L48">dyld_get_image_header</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dladdr1.3.html">dladdr</a>. They iterate over <code>dyld_get_image_header</code> until it returns null and checks if it has seen everything with <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L47">dyld_image_count</a>. The <code>dladdr</code> method provides them with the path of the dylib. These are checked against a few unknown strings but removing everything substrate related from the dyld list fixes this check.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h4>

<p>The other method they use is calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1537934-task_info">task_info</a> with flavor <code>TASK_DYLD_INFO</code>. This also gives them a list of all loaded dylibs and must be fixed separately from the first dyld check.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-checks">File system checks</h3>

<p>There are a couple of file system checks, of which all use the <code>sys_access(33)</code> syscall.</p>

<h4 id="first-list">First list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/Library/Application Support/PhLite/phlite.bundle/AuthAPI.pem</li>
  <li>/private/var/tmp/cydia.log</li>
  <li>/bin/bash</li>
  <li>/usr/sbin/sshd</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/sftp-server</li>
  <li>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</li>
  <li>/.installed_yaluX</li>
  <li>/Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist</li>
  <li>/usr/local/bin/dropbear</li>
  <li>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/enable-dylibs-to-override-cache</li>
  <li>/.cydia_no_stash</li>
  <li>/var/log/jailbreakd-stdout.log</li>
  <li>/etc/motd</li>
  <li>/usr/lib/libsubstitute.dylib</li>
  <li>/var/tmp/slide.txt</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="second-list">Second list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Ghay</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Snapchat.crc</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/embedded.mobileprovision</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="last-one-and-expected-to-exist">Last one (and expected to exist)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/PlugIns</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one makes it a bit harder to fix, since you can not simply replace the arm instructions with something that makes it always return false. Thus requiring an inline hook as replacement for the syscall so you gain full control over it.</p>

<h3 id="obj-c---class-checks">Obj-C - Class checks</h3>

<p>A lot of classes are checked from a lot of different tweaks. This is done using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCOthmanPrefs</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOthmanSnapSaver</code></li>

  <li><code>yytp</code></li>
  <li><code>FLManager</code></li>
  <li><code>DecryptScriptAlertView</code></li>
  <li><code>DzAdsManager</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-checks">Obj-C - Method checks</h3>

<p>They also check methods. This happens using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a> and then <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418530-class_getinstancemethod">class_getInstanceMethod</a>. If any exists, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NSMutableString</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>a</code></li>
      <li><code>b</code></li>
      <li><code>c</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MZ42SGH98C:</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code>
    <ul>

  </li>
  <li><code>UIViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>dzDidTapGalleryButton</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-integrity-checks">Obj-C - Method integrity checks</h3>

<p>Next up is Snapchats own methods. For the classes listed below they first call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418490-class_copymethodlist">class_copyMethodList</a>. Then for every <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/method?language=objc">Method</a> they check if the <code>IMP</code> pointer (address of the function) is within its own <code>__text</code> segment. This is how they detect whether a method has been hooked.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code></li>
  <li><code>MainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatViewControllerV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCScreenshotDetector</code></li>
  <li><code>SCBaseMediaOperaPresenter</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCLoginService</code></li>
  <li><code>SCAdsHoldoutExperimentContext</code></li>
  <li><code>SCExperimentManager</code></li>
  <li><code>SCCaptionDefaultTextView</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatTypingHandler</code></li>
  <li><code>Story</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMessageV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaViewersLayer</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <code>dzan</code> for telling me to check the <code>__text</code> segment. :-)</p>

<h3 id="symbol-checks">Symbol checks</h3>

<p>They also check for a couple of symbols using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a>. If the result is not null, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MSHookMessageEx</code></li>
  <li><code>MSHookFunction</code></li>
  <li><code>_Z17replaced_readlinkPKcPcm</code></li>
  <li><code>hooksArray</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_METACLASS_$__xxx</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_CLASS_$_PHSSaverV2</code></li>
  <li><code>plist</code></li>
  <li><code>flexBreakPoint</code></li>
  <li><code>convert_coordinates_from_device_to_interface</code></li>
  <li><code>OBJC_METACLASS_$_DzSnapHelper</code></li>
  <li><code>ChKey2</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbol-hook-checks">Symbol hook checks</h3>

<p>A few symbols are resolved using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a> to check whether they have been hooked. They first resolve <code>dlsym</code> using <code>dlsym</code>.. yeah.. That result gets used for the <code>dlsym</code> of the symbols below. For every address returned, the first 4 bytes are checked for common hook related instructions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>dlsym</code></li>
  <li><code>objc_getClass</code></li>
  <li><code>class_getInstanceMethod</code></li>
  <li><code>sel_registerName</code></li>
  <li><code>class_copyMethodList</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_image_count</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_get_image_header</code></li>
  <li><code>dladdr</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h3>

<p>I need to be honest, this is a very annoying way how they check for injection because it is annoying to fix. Instead of using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a> they use the <a href="http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=posix/environ.c">environ</a> variable. Since it is a variable, you can not “hook” it.</p>

<p>At least the following variables are detected.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/TweakInject.dylib</code></li>
  <li><code>_MSSafeMode=0</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sandbox-check">Sandbox check</h3>

<p>Probably not an issue for anyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_sandbox.png" alt="iOS sandbox">
</p>

<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>Not much detection done here but still relevant, using <code>sys_sysctl(202)</code> they request at least the following properties.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kern.version</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.osversion</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.proc.pid.&lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>hw.machine</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>The syscall <code>sys_proc_info(33)</code> is also called a couple of times, which could reveal stuff that is ptracing the process. They also use <code>sys_open(5)</code>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>, <code>sys_close(6)</code> and <code>sys_lstat64(340)</code> on the <code>Snapchat</code> binary. Probably to check for modifications or generating a checksum.</p>

<h2 id="how-all-this-stuff-was-found">How all this stuff was found</h2>

<p>A lot of the work was done using a small iOS emulator build on top of <a href="https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn">Unicorn</a>. Using an emulator you can see everything they do. Building this was also teached me a lot about the CoreFoundation library of iOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_emulator.png" alt="iOS emulator">
</p>

<p>Later I implemented a counter for all of my discoveries in a tweak called <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> while carefully keeping track of how my changes modified the detection flags and slowly getting rid of all of them. You can easily find fixes for checks mentioned in this blog post in the “Detections” directory.</p>

<p>You could alternatively trace the syscalls using any of the methods discussed in the WhoYouGonnaSyscall talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/hexploitable">Hexploitable</a>. Slides of the talk can be found <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2con2019/blob/master/talks/WhoYouGonnaSyscall/Hex-r2con2019-WhoYouGonnaSyscall.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-story-on-how-i-wasted-hours-on-fixing-syscalls">A story on how I wasted hours on fixing syscalls</h3>

<p>Let’s take <code>sys_access(33)</code> as an example. It’s implementation looks like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html">this</a>. In short, when a file exists and permission is granted, return <code>0</code>. Otherwise return <code>-1</code>. First thing I did was force both of the results in my emulator but I saw no changes happening to the detection flags.</p>

<p>Later when implementing a fix for this in the <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> tweak, I was unable to have it fail. The arm instructions look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MOV             X0, X27 ; path
MOV             X1, #0  ; mode
MOV             X16, #0x21
SVC             0x80    ; SYS_access
MOV             X0, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
CSEL            X0, X0, XZR, CS
MOV             X27, X0 ; Use result
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>In the <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-product-updates-may-2020/">May updates</a>,
we mentioned Improved Slow Node Tolerance, Multi-Threaded Rank Profile Compilation, Reduced Peak Memory at Startup, Feed Performance Improvements and Increased Tensor Performance.</p>

<p>This month, we’re excited to share the following updates:</p>

<h4 id="support-for-approximate-nearest-neighbor-vector-search">Support for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Vector Search</h4>
<p>Vespa now supports approximate nearest neighbor search which can be combined with filters and text search.
By using a <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-in-vespa-part-1/">native implementation of the HNSW algorithm</a>,
Vespa provides state of the art performance on vector search:
Typical single digit millisecond response time, searching hundreds of millions of documents per node,
but also uniquely allows vector query operators to be combined efficiently with filters and text search -
which is usually a requirement for real-world applications such as text search and recommendation.
Vectors can be updated in real time with a sustained write rate of a few thousand vectors per node per second.
Read more in the documentation on <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a>.</p>

<h4 id="streaming-search-speedup">Streaming Search Speedup</h4>
<p>Streaming Search is a feature unique to Vespa.
It is optimized for use cases like personal search and e-mail search -
but is also useful in high-write applications querying a fraction of the total data set.
With <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/pull/13508">#13508</a>,
read throughput from storage increased up to 5x due to better parallelism.</p>

<h4 id="rank-features">Rank Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The (Native)fieldMatch rank features are optimized to use less CPU query time, improving query latency for
<a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/text-matching-ranking.html#ranking">Text Matching and Ranking</a>.</li>
  <li>The new globalSequence rank feature is an inexpensive global ordering of documents in a system with stable system state.
For a system where node indexes change, this is inaccurate.
See <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/rank-features.html#globalSequence">globalSequence documentation</a> for alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gke-sample-application">GKE Sample Application</h4>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/griseau">Thomas Griseau</a> for contributing a new sample application
for Vespa on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a>,
which is a great way to start using Vespa on Kubernetes.</p>

<hr>
<p>About Vespa: Largely developed by Yahoo engineers,

    <p>I was recently asked to look over some CVs. It’s a while since I’ve done this, so I thought that noting down my immediate reactions as I went through the CVs might help anyone having to circulate their own CV at the moment.</p>

<!--snip-->

<p><img src="https://youknowfordevs.com/images/uploads/christopher-sardegna-iRyGmA_no2Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Photo by Christopher Sardegna on Unsplash"></p>

<p>I’m not for a moment saying I’m right or wrong in the following views, and this is definitely not one of those posts about ‘how to write your CV to land your dream job’. I’m merely laying out the responses I had and more importantly what I felt these reponses told me about the person behind the CV. My ‘gut reaction’ may well be similar to others’ and if they are, it might be worth bearing them in mind when you share your CV.</p>

<h2 id="looks-count-more-than-i-thought">Looks Count More Than I Thought</h2>

<p>First, it wasn’t until I reached the ninth CV that I realised how much a CV’s appearance makes a difference. When viewing numbers one to eight I hadn’t been thinking ‘these look terrible’, but when I reached the ninth, a part of my brain said: ‘Finally! A CV that looks good.’</p>

<p>I think if the role was for a C++ programmer then I probably would have simply smiled to myself, ignored my response, and moved on. That’s not to say that appearance doesn’t matter–or that C++ programmers don’t worry about their appearance–but if I was trying to decide between two C++ programmers it wouldn’t be the look of their CV that was the deciding factor.</p>

<p>But the role for which I was reviewing this batch of CVs was a React developer and there are lots of very talented React developers out there. And when lots of people have worked with GraphQL and Docker and cloud services and D3 then it may well come down to whether or not you have made an effort to convey that you like things to ‘look nice’.</p>

<p>It’s worth saying too that the CVs that looked good didn’t go overboard; all they did was have a pleasing font, perhaps two columns instead of one for the layout, maybe a couple of icons and some colour, and probably didn’t span more than a couple of pages. But that was enough to convince me that these were people who would ensure that a bad-looking product didn’t get deployed.</p>

<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h2>

<p>Probably in the same vein, typos really jump out at you when you are looking at a lot of CVs. Again I’m not saying I’m right or wrong on whether this should be an important criteria, but the fact that my subconcscious reaction was to be turned off if I saw a spelling mistake–or a technology name that had been capitalised incorrectly–shows that somewhere in our psyches this stuff counts for something.</p>

<p>As with the previous point about looks, I’d probably see this as more relevant for front-end people.</p>

<p>And it might be worth saying that it’s usually not difficult to differentiate between those who have just not bothered to check their CV and those that have difficulty with spelling. I’ve worked with people in the latter camp, both senior managers and junior programmers, and it’s not a big deal–you can work with it and it would not stop me from hiring someone.</p>

<p>But to keep with the theme of my ‘initial reaction’, I can’t help that when I see someone write ‘Graphql’ I’m going to doubt whether the applicant really has that much experience with ‘GraphQL’; maybe it’s worth just double-checking the website of the technologies you use one last time, before sending off that CV.</p>

<h2 id="approaches-v-technologies">Approaches v. Technologies</h2>

<p>One other thing that I hadn’t expected was that I was drawn to mark people more highly if they gave some indication of the <em>approach</em> they took to their coding and development. For example, a few people mentioned having experience with TDD, which I thought was good. That doesn’t mean I’d rule out someone who didn’t have TDD experience, but it’s an approach that people need to be aware of.</p>

<p>However, more importantly than TDD, only a handful indicated that they liked to get involved in code reviews and saw them as a good way to share knowledge and build a consistent and high quality codebase. Again, I would not rule out someone who didn’t mention code reviews, mentoring, and so on, provided they were relatively inexperienced; but I probably <em>would</em> rule out someone who clearly has experience, but hasn’t thought to mention these things.</p>

<h3 id="approach-from-technologies">Approach From Technologies</h3>

<p>What I was also surprised by was how the list of technologies on a person’s CV led to me forming an impression of the kind of coder that person was. If I saw GraphQL in the mix then I found myself thinking ‘modern tech stack’. It may be unfair, especially since GraphQL wasn’t mentioned in the job description that was circulated; but after reviewing all of the CVs I found that it was a pretty accurate indicator of the types of projects someone had been involved in.</p>

<p>There were other technologies that were similarly indicative, such as mention of ‘microservices’, or use of MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on. But there were very few CVs where these technologies appeared without GraphQL.</p>

<p>There is probably no general rule here, since the technologies that differentiate will be different in each cohort of CVs; if every CV included GraphQL then it may have been the presence of something like Docker and/or Kubernetes that told you something about the kind of people you were looking at.</p>

<h2 id="public-profile">Public Profile</h2>

<p>This last point may also be controversial, but I’m going to describe it so that you can do whatever you like with the information; if someone was not on LinkedIn or didn’t have a public Git account, I found myself thinking ‘well, what exactly do they do?’</p>

<p>From this batch of 22 CVs, only one had answered any questions on Stack Overflow, and only one–a different person–had done any talks at Meetups. A couple had GitHub accounts, a couple were on LinkedIn and a couple had blogs.</p>

<p>This is no doubt unfair, so again, blame my subconscious. But I can’t help think that if I’m going to work with some people day after day, I want to be with people that are sharing links to things they’ve read, people who are trying out new technologies and languages, people who have weekend projects, or who are contributing bug fixes back to open source projects.</p>

<p>And although I’m not particularly a big fan of LinkedIn, I always quite like it when I see people who are at the early stages of their career making connections with everyone they met at last night’s Meetup.</p>

<p>None of this is to ignore the current discussion about work/life balance–to demand that people do their own education in their own time, spend all waking hours coding, attend Meetups every night of the week. But it is to recognise that we are in a fast-moving industry, and if you want your CV to be picked from amongst that batch of 22, then it’s going to be important to think about how you come across.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>One final thing has just occurred to me…I didn’t consider the qualifications of <em>anyone</em>, which I imagine is down to the role that the CVs were for. You’d certainly be interested in degrees and PhDs if you were hiring a data scientist or someone to write an operating system; in these spaces theory is a major element. But for fast-moving technologies like front-end development, you can probably tell everything about a person from their experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I haven’t had to look at CVs for quite a while, so it was interesting to examine my own responses to reviewing this batch. What became clear is that I quickly ‘merged’ the CV and the person in my mind. If there were mistakes in the CV I couldn’t help but imagine someone who lacked attention to detail. If there was a little bit of colour in the CV or the person had spoken at a Meetup then I couldn’t help but think that this was a person who was prepared to go the extra mile. And if the person had a public Git account then my spontaneous reaction was that this was someone who wanted to keep learning, and really enjoyed the work they do.</p>

<p>I may be wrong in my judgements or harsh in my conclusions, but if you’re about to send your CV out, at least you now have a couple more insights that might help you decide how your CV is representing you.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<span>Figure</span><span>&nbsp;1:  </span></span><span><span>An example of a simple, common Java syntax error (</span><a href="#x1-1001r1"><span>a</span></a><span>) and the problems traditional</span>
<span>error recovery has in dealing with it. </span><span>javac </span><span>(</span><a href="#x1-1011r2"><span>b</span></a><span>) spots the error when it encounters ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’. Its error</span>
<span>recovery algorithm then repairs the input by inserting a semicolon before ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ (i.e.</span><span>&nbsp;making the input</span>
<span>equivalent to ‘</span><span>int x; y;</span><span>’). This then causes a spurious parsing error, since ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ on its own is not</span>

<span>insert an equals sign (</span><span>‘int x = y;’</span><span>).</span>

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

      Symbolic execution with SymCC: Don't interpret, compile!
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the 29th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 20),
    Boston, MA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      A major impediment to practical symbolic execution is speed, especially
      when compared to near-native speed solutions like fuzz testing. We propose
      a compilation-based approach to symbolic execution that performs better
      than state-of-the-art implementations by orders of magnitude. We present
      SymCC, an LLVM-based C and C++ compiler that builds concolic execution
      right into the binary. It can be used by software developers as a drop-in
      replacement for <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>clang++</tt>, and we show how to
      add support for other languages with little effort. In comparison with
      KLEE, SymCC is faster by up to three orders of magnitude and an average
      factor of 12. It also outperforms QSYM, a system that recently showed
      great performance improvements over other implementations, by up to two
      orders of magnitude and an average factor of 10. Using it on real-world
      software, we found that our approach consistently achieves higher
      coverage, and we discovered two vulnerabilities in the heavily tested
      OpenJPEG project, which have been confirmed by the project maintainers and
      assigned CVE identifiers.
    </p>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is a fast compiler-based symbolic execution engine. On this page, we
    provide SymCC's source code, the raw results of the experiments described in
    the paper, as well as instructions how you can replicate those experiments
    yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symcc">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe two sets of experiments: we first benchmark SymCC
    on the CGC programs, then we run it on real-world software. This section
    describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides links to our
    results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        CGC experiments (our results
        for <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_pure_time.csv">pure
        execution
        time</a>, <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_time.csv">concolic
        execution time</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_coverage.tar.gz">coverage</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We used the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios">Linux
          port</a> of the CGC programs by Trail of Bits. SymCC needs to be built
        with support for 32-bit compilation (see <tt>docs/32-bit.txt</tt>;
        this is not part of the Dockerfile because it would double the build
        time of the container while providing value to just a few users). Then
        you can simply export
        <tt>CC=/path/to/symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=/path/to/sym++</tt> and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, and
        build the CGC programs as usual (i.e., by invoking their build.sh script).
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the programs on the raw PoV inputs
        with <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt> to measure pure execution
        time, and unset the environment variable for symbolic execution. To
        assess coverage, we ran <tt>afl-showmap</tt> with the
        AFL-instrumented CGC programs on each generated input and accumulated
        the resulting coverage maps per program, resulting in a set of covered
        map entries for each CGC program. The sizes of those sets can then be
        fed to the scoring formula presented in the paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        For KLEE and QSYM, we used the setup
        described <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/ir_study.html">here</a> but with the regular 32-bit
        binaries built by cb-multios.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        The analysis of real-world software always follows the same procedure.
        Assuming you have exported <tt>CC=symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=sym++</tt>
        and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, first download the code,
        then build it using its own build system, finally
        unset <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT</tt> and analyze the program in
        concert with AFL (which requires building a second time for AFL,
        see <tt>docs/Fuzzing.txt</tt>). We used AFL 2.56b and built the
        targets with <tt>AFL_USE_ASAN=1</tt>. Note that the fuzzing helper
        is already installed in the Docker container.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg.git">OpenJPEG</a>
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_openjpeg.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we used revision <tt>1f1e9682</tt>, built with CMake as
          described in the project's <tt>INSTALL.md</tt>
          (adding <tt>-DBUILD_THIRDPARTY=ON</tt> to make sure that third-party
          libraries are compiled with SymCC as well), and
          analyzed <tt>bin/opj_decompress -i @@ -o /tmp/image.pgm</tt>; the
          corpus consisted of test
          files <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/blob/master/input/conformance/file1.jp2">file1.jp2</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/blob/master/input/conformance/file8.jp2">file8.jp2</a>.
        </li>

          <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive.git">libarchive</a>
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_libarchive.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we used revision <tt>9ebb2484</tt>, built with CMake as
          described in the poject's <tt>INSTALL</tt> (but
          adding <tt>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</tt>), and
          analyzed <tt>bin/bsdtar tf @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a
          single dummy file containing the character "A".
        </li>

        <li>
          tcpdump
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_tcpdump.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we built both tcpdump and libpcap; in order to make the
          former find the latter, just place the source directories next to each
          other in the same folder. We used revision <tt>d615abec</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git">libpcap</a>
          and revision <tt>d57927e1</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump.git">tcpdump</a>.
          We built first libpcap and then tcpdump with <tt>./configure
          &amp;&amp; make</tt>, and analyzed
          <tt>tcpdump/tcpdump -e -r @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a single dummy
          file containing the character "A".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All experiments used one AFL master process, one secondary AFL process,
        and one SymCC process. We let them run for 24 hours and repeated each of
        them 30 times to create the graphs in the paper; AFL map density was
        extracted from the secondary AFL process' <tt>plot_data</tt> file,
        column <tt>map_size</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The QSYM experiments used an analogous setup, replacing SymCC with QSYM
        and running it with AFL according to the QSYM
        authors' <a href="https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym#run-hybrid-fuzzing-with-afl">instructions</a>.

<p>In the last couple of months since Ireland announced the lockdown, our team has been performing at a high pace and have become self-organised to a large extent. As a team lead, this has allowed me the privilege of stepping back to look at the broader picture of how our team works individually and, more importantly, together. Through some exercises, I have identified some  methods to gather improvement ideas that can be applied to any team. </p>



<p>Anyone who has been a part of a high functioning team understands that continuous improvement is not optional. In order to perform better and to keep performing, the team must identify their weaknesses and plan to strengthen or mitigate those weaknesses. These improvements remedy stress points in the team, technical debt, repetitive tasks and so forth. The mindset of continuous growth is one that must be worked on and nurtured over time. Your team is not a fine wine – it will not improve if left alone in the corner. It will go sour.</p>



<p>It is one thing to be told to improve something. But very often, being told to improve something does not necessarily benefit you or your team.&nbsp;For example, if my manager comes to me and tells me my communication is poor and he wants bi-weekly emails from now on from my team’s status, all he has done is improve one of his problems, not mine. Improvements must come from within the team, and they must be gathered and executed on regularly. So the question is – how do we gather improvements that are worthwhile and specific enough to solve our problems, not someone else’s?</p>



<h2>80/20 Analysis</h2>



<p>The Pareto Principle, most commonly known as the 80/20 rule, states that about 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In layman’s terms, most of the good things your team is known for doing likely comes from a small subset of your total work.</p>



<p>In my case, my team is known for our expertise in the upgrading of our product. How much of our work is related to this each week? I’d estimate less than 10%.</p>



<p>S<em>ide note</em>: This wasn’t always the case. When we first formed as a team, we spent about 90% of our time on this work. </p>



<p>Over time our mindset of continuous improvement led us to automating away most of our problems. Here is how you can utilize the 80/20 rule to find pressure points to improve. I do this regularly by myself, and occasionally with my team.</p>



<h3>Create a chart.</h3>



<p>Drawing on a piece of paper or whiteboard produces far more ideas than typing on a screen. So create a chart!</p>



<h4>What is going poorly?</h4>



<p>Always start with the bad. What makes you stressed on a Monday? Why does your team constantly get called for customer escalations on a Sunday? What makes you cry at night? (If you’re crying at night you really need this). </p>



<p>Copy the following table onto a piece of paper and fill it out now with any ideas you have.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>20% Activity</strong></th><th><strong>80% Pain</strong></th><th><strong>Action to Remedy</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Monday morning team presentation to management.</td><td>Stressful if I’m not prepped.</td><td>Give a practice run to my team on Friday.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h4>What is going well?</h4>



<p>This is less effective than analyzing what is poor in the team. You should prioritise fixing the bad over improving the good. There is no point in improving what your team is already good at if there are still issues that stress them. </p>



<p>Ask yourself – what are your team doing well? What do you need to keep doing well? What would happen if you improved these items?</p>



<p>Again, copy the following table onto a piece of paper and fill it out.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>20% Activity</strong></th><th><strong>80% Reward</strong></th><th><strong>Improvement reward</strong></th><th><strong>Action to improve</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Quick bug turnaround.</td><td>No weekend work.</td><td>Become the team with the lowest bug turnaround time.</td><td>Make incoming bugs a priority over stories.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>You see the action columns? Take those, discuss with the team whether they agree on the actions required, and put them clearly for all to see everyday. You could create a task in your backlog that gets seen everyday on your sprint board, or print them and place them in your team’s area.</p>



<h2>Preventative Actions</h2>



<p>Identifying Preventative Actions is something that I have recently come across. Each team in my project go through this process every 3 weeks (every sprint). Here’s how it works. </p>



<p>A high priority bug has come into your team. You have spent all weekend pouring over it with your team, and finally came up with a solution late Sunday night, allowing your customer to continue their business as usual. Before you close the bug, there are a couple of things you need to consider and you <strong>must</strong> get answers to them. Otherwise, there will be another weekend in the future that will interrupt your team.</p>



<h3>Why did this bug occur?</h3>



<ul><li>We received a bad requirement specification from our business analysts.</li><li>We missed a corner case in our testware.</li><li>There were too many manual steps in the documentation which led to human error.</li><li>We missed a critical part of our study when planning the requirement.</li></ul>



<h3>What correction did you apply?</h3>



<ul><li>We built a patch fix and sent it to the customer.</li><li>We clarified with the customer that the particular use case reported is not supported yet.</li></ul>



<h3>How will you prevent this type of issue from occurring in the future?</h3>



<ul><li>We will call a 1 hour meeting with our business analyst each week to plan and clarify the feature request.</li><li>We will build a new pipeline that will test our customer’s use case each night.</li><li>We will automate steps x,y and z in our documentation so that human error is reduced.</li></ul>



<p>In my team’s case, for each bug we have the following grid which we fill out.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Root Cause</strong></th><th><strong>Correction Applied</strong></th><th><strong>Preventative Action</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A test case to click on the ‘About’ page in Firefox was missing from our GUI test suite.</td><td>Added this test case to the GUI suite.</td><td>Review GUI test cases as part of a feature sign-off in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Retrospective</h2>



<p>If your team uses the scrum framework for their work, then you will be very familiar with the retrospective. However, you do not need to work in a scrum environment to have a team retrospective. </p>



<p>Team retrospectives, if taken regularly, can be a valuable tool in the team’s work week and is an opportunity for the team to come together and discuss the good and bad things that have happened in the past few weeks. </p>



<p>A retro should be scheduled on a regular basis, and you as the team lead must lead the meeting. Make sure that everyone from the team is present for the retro, and ensure that everyone is taking part and answering the questions.</p>



<h3>What was good that you need to keep doing?</h3>



<ul><li>We closed out 100% of our stories for the sprint.</li><li>There was good communication with our management.</li><li>We trialed pair programming this sprint – we have seen excellent results and should continue to do this.</li></ul>



<h3>What was bad?</h3>



<ul><li>We had poor communication within the team.<ul><li><em>Improvement</em>: We will trial pair programming for a sprint.</li></ul></li><li>The QA team raised tickets with very little detail resulting in a few days of delay in closing.<ul><li><em>Improvement</em>: Create a template that you would find helpful and send it to the QA team lead. Request that they copy this template and fill it out for all future tickets.</li></ul></li><li>We allowed untested code into the production software.<ul><li><em>Improvement</em>: Revise the +2 code review criteria with the team.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The most important part of the retro is to make sure that improvements or solutions are attached to each ‘bad’ item that is discussed.<br>At the end of the retro, prioritise the top one or two improvements, and take note of them for the upcoming sprint to execute.</p>



<h2>Improvement Backlog</h2>



<p>To become a top performing team, each individual must be comfortable with raising and discussing improvements as part of the team’s responsibilities. A team that does not have improvement ideas is a team that is not interested in improving which will lead to stagnation and a low performing team.</p>



<p>An improvement backlog is a list of ideas maintained and prioritised by the team. The list can be physical, like stickies on a whiteboard, or digital, like part of your jira backlog. </p>



<p>For example, my team created a Jira sprint and named it ‘Improvement Ideas’. We have list about 50 improvement ideas, most of which are one-liners and some of which have been discussed with details and acceptance criteria attached.</p>



<p>Each sprint planning, we prioritise this list and take the items we feel are most valuable to us. We have a couple of ad-hoc rules for this backlog.</p>



<ul><li>Any ideas that come up in meetings are inserted as a ‘one-liners’ in this backlog.</li><li>The list is regularly prioritised each sprint.</li><li>Each idea is explained by the team member who originally raised it.</li><li>We take 10-20% of our sprint capacity for improvements.</li></ul>



<p>Keeping this backlog up to date and prioritised will ensure that your team has consistent tasks to work on that primarily help the team.</p>



<h2>Stakeholder Feedback</h2>



<p>Working in a team can often be like working in a bubble. It is tempting to fall into confirmation bias. The most valuable improvements you can get for your product will come from your customers and stakeholders. </p>



<p>Leading the team does not only include leading the people on the team. If your team are known for building the wrong thing, or if their customers are not satisfied with their part of the product, then you as the team lead have ultimately failed.</p>



<p>When it comes to feedback, there is nothing more valuable than your own customers’ feedback. Your customers drive your product backlog. If you are in a large company, you may not have direct contact with your customers. In big companies, customers are often separated by layers of business analysts and management. This is not ideal, but it is something you can work around. </p>



<p>All you need is a small list of stakeholders that consistently use your product area to gain feedback from them. Talk to your managers about the customer interface and who could give feedback. In my case, we were 6 months without any contact with stakeholders that could give us valuable feedback. Eventually we were able to make friends with two guys who act as an interface to one of our company’s top …</p></article></div>

Payment issues are one of the leading causes for involuntary churn.<br></p><p>Yet, the number one reason for losing customers in the checkout process is due to a failure in the card network infrastructure.

However, even if you try hard to offer a seamless experience, you can still lose customers due to payment issues or because your customer card details it's out of date.<br></p><p><strong><em>Preventing failing payments allows you to decrease churn and increase subscribers' retention.&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p><p>Within a subscription business, customer churn is the number of customers who stop paying for their subscription or unsubscribe during a given period. Addressing your customer churn challenges becomes more and more critical for your subscription business to succeed.<br></p><p><strong>There are two types of churn: voluntary and involuntary churn.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>In a voluntary churn, the customer decides to consciously unsubscribe when they feel they aren't getting the full value of your product or can't continue with the subscription. Voluntary churn is often based on customer experience rather than the operational aspects, and regardless of what you do, they might be already convinced to unsubscribe.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now, involuntary churn is not so related to your customer experience. Rather is more related to operational issues that could happen due to payment issues, expired credit cards, insufficient funds or card number has been updated.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Involuntary churn isn't limited to the least engaged customers; it affects all of your subscribers, even the happiest customers (remember they can be as forgetful as your lowest-value customers). By tackling involuntary churn, you can prevent customers from leaving while continuing offering a seamless subscriber experience.<br></p><p>Involuntary churn harms your customer lifetime value (CLTV). Let's say your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is $60, and the expected contract time is 18 months. If you have 100 customers and half of them are lost due to involuntary churn, that's 50% of subscribers leaving you, which is not useful when you are looking to optimize your customer lifetime value.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Involuntary churn is somehow easier to prevent than voluntary churn. You can avoid these involuntary challenges without changing your proposition or business model. Involuntary and voluntary churn can be prevented by taking the right measurements and having the proper process at hand.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Implement solutions to reduce churn and prevent customers from leaving you again in the future with these 5 strategies:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>1. Understand the root cause</strong></p><p>Billing systems or credit cards don't work perfectly. Understand what happens when a payment fails; try to get the why does this keep happening. You can use data for this or ask your customers directly.<br></p><p>If you still have some payment issues this could be due to:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Insufficient funds from your customer</li><li>Customer bank account was closed</li><li>Credits over the limit to make payments</li><li>The card has expired or is no longer valid&nbsp;</li><li>Other payments issues (like temporary down-time)<br></li></ul><p>These are crucial questions to determine how to prevent failed payments and to retarget customers that are about to leave.

Besides, understand if they are having problems receiving the products, or not enough customer experience and address these issues with a seamless payment process with a proactive customer-oriented billing and payment service.<br></p><p><strong>3. Keep customers that don't want to leave from leaving with a seamless experience</strong><br></p><p><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/what-is-product-as-a-service-paas">Product-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a> subscription services often lack reminders that communicate with their customers about changing their payment options. Friendly reminders are always a great way to include a link that enables customers to update their billing information with an urgent tone.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoid the spam folder. Regularly engage with subscribers, ask them in a non-spammy way what they think about the product, if they are happy or dissatisfied with your product, and why. Make sure to send your emails from return email so customers can get in touch with you if needed. By educating customers about special offers, price increases, and product updates, you stay connected with subscribers and increase your customer experience (CX).

Subscriber management&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Provide a seamless branded personalized billing and payment experience across all channels—update subscribers' information with a software that can update information more easily. Use a single solution that manages your subscribers through their life cycle, including payment updates and add-ons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Offer customers flexible and customized payment schedules with constant support. Accept payments through various channels with integration with secure payment gateways that accept multiple currencies and safeguard your customer data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Subscriber management is also essential once your company starts scaling, and extra support is needed, especially with your customized promotions, customer satisfaction, inventory management, and logistics.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>5. Built-in dunning management</strong></p><p>Know when subscribers' credit card expires and take further steps to prevent this from happening. One way to remind your subscribers when their payment method needs to be updated is by sending a series of email (app) messages encouraging customers to update their payment method soon.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Pre-dunning messages come in handy when you don't have another payment system to catch card updates.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep in mind that it is crucial to dedicate most of your efforts while they are still actively using your product (considering that it would be harder to capture them once they are gone).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Irregular billing can happen throughout your customer lifecycle, so having subscribers engaged can severely impact your customer subscription status. Prompt users to update their billing information while you make sure to have all the systems in place to prevent involuntary churn. In Firmhouse, we try at least 3 times to collect the payment from the customer. If this is not successful, the customer gets flagged and customer support will take over. Having a well trained customer support team can help you with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>What to learn how to automate your payment process?

<p>There is a lot of fluff in Entrepreneurship and Product Management which is passed around as magical silver bullets. One of which I dislike is the “Aha Moment.”</p>



<p>A friend added me into a Twitter thread, which trigged a long time rant I had on it.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Frankly "Ah ha" Moments are overrated, Only at launch do products do just one thing for all their users. In most cases selection of a product is a series of "Ok" moments. &lt;cont&gt;</p>— Ravi Vyas ⊾ (@ravivyas84) <a href="https://twitter.com/ravivyas84/status/1280370903042252801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>A product is a Stack of things.</h2>



<p>The Aha Moment is supposed to be the moment when a user realizes the value of your product. The problem lies in the fact that rarely does a product just do one thing. Products are a “Stack” of features, ideologies, business, and growth plans and services. Users may ignore deficiencies in multiple parts of the stack for surfeits in the other parts. How many times have you heard someone say, I use the product because the support is great?</p>



<p>Sometimes it is not a “feature”, rather those that don’t exist in the product like great pricing, a just ideology, or simply the location of the team running the product that plays into whether the product will be used. For example, I decided to pay for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hey.com/" target="_blank">Hey</a> because of their ideology, I paid for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://threadreaderapp.com/" target="_blank">Thread Reader</a> to support indie devs and great service. I am playing around with <a href="https://hostomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hostomy</a> because it is a service recommended by a friend and is insanely cheap.</p>



<p>Aha moments do exist, but they are hard to achieve and harder to retain as the “Aha Moment” becomes the new normal. Stories for Snapchat might have been one, but today, it is the new Normal, or for some, a passing fad.</p>



<h2>OK Moments</h2>



<p>A better way to think of Great Products is using “OK Moments”. OK moments are basically moments where the users agree with some part of your product, and the best part is they compound.</p>



<p>Here are examples of OK moments</p>



<ul><li>OK, A friend Referred Product X to me</li><li>OK, Product X can do this</li><li>OK, I an afford product X</li><li>OK, Even my good friend uses product X</li><li>OK, Product X will handle Migration</li><li>OK, Product Y is being forced into the organization</li><li>OK, Product Y has this blocker for me, which Product X does not.</li><li>OK, Product X has a free trial, let me use it.</li><li>OK, Product X is a lifetime purchase rather than a monthly subscription</li><li>OK, Product X won an award from Apple, might be good.</li><li>OK, Product X supports the same causes as I do</li></ul>



<p>Each OK moment is either a problem being solved or a spotlight being cast on the product. The Aha moment at the end of the day is a threshold of OK moments, a threshold that is different for different people.</p>



<h2>Start Stacking</h2>



<p>If you are building a product, it is time to stack the OK Product bricks, after all, each innovation we know stands on a stack of others. A point Matt Ridley makes in his book, How Innovation Works.</p>

<p>OK Moments are no different, so start stacking OK moments across each point of interaction you have with your users to get to the point where everyone else thinks you have figured out your Aha Moment.</p>

Once I had my radiation detector kit hooked up to my Raspberry Pi running InfluxDB and Grafana, I found myself woodworking, machining, and fabricobbling an enclosure out of mahogany, brass, copper, toggle switches and, because it just had to be done, nixie tubes.</p>

<p>Read the story of the almost year-long journey (<em>cough</em> some other stuff cropped up…) I went on to make my steampunk vision a reality below, and if you want to get up and running quickly, find out how to <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/">build your own simple version right here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introductionspanidintrospan">Introduction <span id="intro"></span></h2>

<p>Low cost radiation monitors and Geiger counter kits have been available online for around $30-50US/£25-45 for a while, but standing alone they don’t do much other than make the recognizable “clicking” sound we all know from movies and TV. I decided to up the ante by connecting one to a Raspberry Pi, storing the data with InfluxDB, and showing the readings with a Grafana dashboard.</p>



<p>I updated the tech, gave it a web interface, added remote management, and built a custom mahogany housing with brass and copper fittings to show everything off, because it’s important to look suitably <em>hip</em> when sitting on the desk next to your <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-train-station-oled-sign-for-your-desk/">train sign</a>… right?</p>

</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m gonna show what I built to hopefully provide some inspiration, then show you how to get up and running with a simpler version of the project that anyone can build at home without any special tools. Let’s hit this.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="inspirationdesignspanidinspirationspan">Inspiration &amp; design <span id="inspiration"></span></h2>

<p>I’ve always found the idea of radiation fascinating; how there are invisible particles moving around at incredibly high speeds, crashing into things and flipping bits all around us. Due to my fascination, it doesn’t take a lot to capture my interest when it comes to this field.</p>

<p>One day last year I was reminiscing over the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44606771">now defunct</a> UK-based electronics retailer Maplin, and how they sold all sorts of interesting kits for the aspiring engineer. This led me to <a href="https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2019/09/maplin-geiger-counter/">Richard Mudhar’s blog</a> where he tells the story of the <em>Maplin Geiger Counter</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/mudhar-example.png" alt="An excerpt and image from Richard Mudhar's post"></p>

</figure>

<p>The kit that Richard has built above features both an electromechanical counter on the left, and two rings of LEDs reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron">dekatron tubes</a> on the right. This display has the neat design feature that as the rate of count increases, the display becomes more noticeable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/dekatron.gif" alt=""></p>

</figure>

<p>I liked the idea of combining the modern technology on the inside (Raspberry Pi, Grafana, etc.) with the timeless look of brass, copper, toggle switches, dark hardwood, and glass on the outside. The idea was now to build something that looked old and had that distinctive steampunk style, but was up to date and Internet-connected.</p>

<p>In addition to the total absolute count like the old Maplin counter, I wanted to offer a live display of the counts per minute (CPM) reading, and what better way to do this than with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tubes</a>, to get that nice warm orange glow and keep things looking cosy.</p>

<p>I started scribbling down ideas and thoughts of materials I wanted to use alongside shopping lists for parts, and possible designs for the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/notes.jpg" alt="Original shop notes!"></p>

<figure>  
Notes don’t survive well in a machine shop, but these are what’s left of my original sketches.  
</figure>

<p>This process was very much led by an image I had in my mind about how the thing should look and feel and so I just had to make it real… somehow.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="thebuildspanidbuildspan">The build <span id="build"></span></h2>

<p>With some thoughts and ideas scribbled down it was time to get started. As this is for the most part going to be a bespoke, hand-built item, and made up as I go along, it’s not necessary to put everything in CAD. There are of course some core items that exist already and cannot change size; the Raspberry Pi and radiation detector board, for example. These are off-the-shelf parts that have to fit in the box no matter what, and start to dictate the size of the final unit.</p>

<p>Almost all other parts are completely hand made, machined and fabricated. This was necessitated by the desire to make everything authentic; I didn’t want to build things just for looks, I wanted any design choices made for aesthetic reasons to also be functional; by this I mean when I put 18 screws in something to make it look good, they are going to be 18 <em>real</em> screws that you have to take out to gain access!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each of the build log images link to a separate gallery when clicked. You can look through the images that way if you prefer, or read on in full detail.</p>

<h3 id="thefrontpanelspanidpanelspan">The front panel <span id="panel"></span></h3>

<p>I started with the front panel of the housing, I knew I wanted two toggle switches; one for power and one for sound (to disable the clicking noise), along with 3 nixie tubes to display the CPM up to 999. Normal background radiation is in the range of about 25-75 CPM, so I figured if background radiation is above 999 CPM, we have bigger problems than worrying about enough digits on the counter.</p>



<p>The two front panel pieces are made from 6mm thick mild steel plate, cut to size with an angle grinder and then milled to dimension with the help of Bridget, the Bridgeport. Holes are then cut for the nixies and the toggle switches.</p>



<p>I manufactured labels for each by hand-punching lettering into 0.5mm thick brass sheet, polishing and fixing with M2 screws. The steel pieces are coated with a clear lacquer to prevent corrosion.</p>

<h3 id="workingwithwoodspanidwoodspan">Working with wood <span id="wood"></span></h3>

<p>Wood isn’t my favourite material to work with, I mean it just changes shape of its own accord! Who can work with that?! Anyhow, it’s very pretty, and so it was decided that the outer box should be made of hardwood. I started with a scrap piece of mahogany, cut it to halve the thickness on the bandsaw, and then set about planing and shaping the sides of the box to fit the dimensions of the Raspberry Pi (3A+) and the radiation detector.</p>



<p>The dimensions of the front panel along with the steel faceplates were planned out in Fusion 360 so that I could print a cutting and drilling template. This was taped onto the planed piece of mahogany, the holes for screws were drilled, and the openings for components cut out.</p>



<p>The pieces were cut at 45 degree angles to enable a mitre joint in each corner. The joints were reinforced with biscuits (mmm biscuits), and then the 4 sides were glued and clamped and allowed to cure overnight.</p>



<p>The top and bottom of the case are made from the same scrap mahogany, but planed a lot thinner - approximately 6mm, the same as the steel plate.</p>

<h3 id="topbrassspanidbrassspan">Top brass <span id="brass"></span></h3>

<p>I had the idea that it would look good to hold the box together with a totally unnecessary amount of screws, 36 to be exact; 18 on top and 18 on the bottom. To prevent the screws damaging the wood surface and to add some extra detail to the top of the case I decided to make a brass plate that the screws all go through to clamp the top cover down.</p>



<p>Some pieces of 2mm brass strip were cut, mitred on the corners and soldered together. Once soldered, sanded and polished, the joints are barely visible.</p>



<p>Holes for screws were then drilled, and the brass plate used to secure the oversize lid to the box whilst it was sanded to size on a drum sander. I later learned that using a drum sander for this was a mistake as it marked the sides of the box, but you live and learn!</p>

<h3 id="imitationdekatronsspaniddekatronsspan">Imitation Dekatrons <span id="dekatrons"></span></h3>

<p>My attempt at imitating the Dekatron tube effect starts with a piece of 50mm stainless steel (or aluminium) bar. The bar is turned on a lathe down to 40mm, and to have a cavity for the electronics. The work is removed from the lathe and parted off on a bandsaw before being returned to the lathe to have a hole drilled in the rear for cabling to drive the LEDs.</p>



<p>The part is then put on the milling machine to have 10 holes drilled and M2 <del>taps snapped off in the holes</del> threaded ready to fasten the faceplate.</p>



<p>The brass faceplate is made from the same 0.5mm thick brass sheet as the labels from the faceplates. Each piece is drilled with 20 holes (10 for LEDs, 10 for fasteners), and then hand stamped with the numbering for each LED.</p>

The wired LED faceplate ready to be screwed into the housing.  
</figure>  
</div>

<p>The LEDs are wired with a common ground and connected using a piece of recycled floppy disk drive ribbon cable. All the work is then carried out a second time for the ‘X10’ display. The eagle-eyed readers will notice that the second display is made from a different material than the first - this is due to the fact I snapped both a drill bit and a tap off in the M2 holes - working with stainless steel with these small tools is very difficult! I ended up making the second from aluminium, which machines like butter, in comparison.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this project I found myself continually swapping fasteners and trying different combinations to see what looks best. The end result is a mix of M2 and M3 metric machine screws in both brass and stainless steel, cheese head and countersunk head, all slotted. You may notice that in earlier photos some of the parts were assembled with Allen-head cap screws but these were later swapped out. Ebay is usually a great place to get small quantities of fasteners of all different shapes and sizes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is no secret that building and running a business is not easy no matter how small or big it may be. There are a huge number of obstacles that one has to overcome, but while building<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/"> </a>this <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">Shopify WhatsApp app</a> with my co-founder Preetam, I realised that all the obstacles become significantly easier to overcome when you are not in it alone.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>To be clear, I have tremendous respect for solo founders. These guys undertake a very lonely journey where nobody else can relate to their problems or achievements for that matter. When you have a bad day, you can't really explain it to someone because the feeling is unique to your situation and when you reach a milestone, you can probably celebrate it with your friends and loved ones but they would never truly understand how big a deal it is for you to have achieved that milestone.&nbsp; So I just want to give a shout out to all the solo founders out there and encourage them to keep crushing it in life.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>Having said this, I would now like to highlight some advantages of starting a business with at least one other person.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‍</strong></p></div><p><strong>Accountability</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>It is safe to assume that a person who quits their job and lives off of their savings in order to take on the challenge of building a business is dedicated and driven but this does not make them immune from laziness. In fact if your business starts showing some amount of success, it is even more likely that you might slack off because you no longer have to worry about paying the bills or making rent because you have revenue coming in to take care of that. So that fire that kept you on your toes is gone.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p>Even if you don’t slack off for a single day of your life, you are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Mistakes that don’t have any redemption because only you get affected by the mistake.</p><p>‍</p><p>Having a partner who is just as vested into the venture as you are changes this. You are now accountable to each other and have somebody to answer to when you slack off or make a mistake. This might sound very counterintuitive because the reason why people start businesses is to not have anyone to answer to. But I have found during my journey that this is not always a bad thing and it is actually essential sometimes.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Productivity</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>When you start a business there are many skills that you may have to learn based on what domain your business is in. For instance when we started<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/"> </a>our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">Shopify application</a>, we needed to know Product design, Front-end tech, back-end tech, marketing and distribution, landing page design and customer support. Now obviously if you are a solo founder you could argue that you could hire people for doing all of this but the truth of the matter is that even if you hire people to delegate a job, you still need to have some amount of understanding about that job so that you can hire the right people for the job and gauge whether your employee is performing well or not. In other words you have to learn many skills from scratch.</p><p>‍</p><p>If one person were to learn all of these skills, it would take a lot more time and mental bandwidth than dividing those skills amongst two people who will then nail all the aspects of the business that they are responsible for. It is therefore very important to choose a business partner who has an affinity to the skills that complement your own. This is easier said than done but I would say it is worth spending time just to find a partner that compliments your skills instead of being of the mindset that it would be a waste of time to do so.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Moral support</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Oftentimes founders might find themselves in a situation where they face a problem that only they can solve and they aren’t sure how to do it yet. During such times it is very easy to go down a spiral of thoughts which might convince you that nobody is coming to help you and you are on your own so you are pretty much screwed. During such times it greatly helps if somebody that stands to lose the same thing that you do if you don’t solve the problem tells you that it is going to be okay.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>This is what my dynamic is like with my co-founder. If he screws up or feels down due to some factor that we had no control over, I tell him that we will live through this and if I screw up, he tells me it is going to be okay. This simple aspect can actually help a lot with maintaining the morale and moving forward despite facing something that might seem like the end of the world at that point of time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Happiness multiplies when you achieve a milestone</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>When you build a business the only way for the outside world to gauge whether you achieved a milestone or not is based on how much money you are making, but for the people involved in building the business, there are a ton of non monetary achievements that give you happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>For instance when we started out, our product was free for a while but we were gaining a lot of users every day and collecting feedback on what features they would be willing to pay for. This process was a magical time for us and we were the only ones who were capable of deriving happiness out of it. This happiness cannot really be shared with someone not involved in the business because they would not be able to relate to the feeling of talking to a customer from another country using google translate and understanding what their needs were and how we can solve them.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Someone once said to me that life is all about the people you meet and the things you build together. I genuinely believe this to be true and I would urge aspiring Entrepreneurs to make a full hearted attempt to find a business partner that aligns with your vision. I would also strongly suggest not to be hasty while finding a partner because working with a bad business partner is way worse than working alone and this is something that I experienced with my previous failed venture.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>This piece is an introduction a new series—called <em>Unitaskers</em>—that will feature single-purpose artifacts that let you do one thing.</p>
<p>Think, for instance, of a graphite pencil. It's useful to write or draw. You can sharpen it to get thin lines or tilt it to get thicker, faded strokes. You can write a letter or draw a house. You can trace continuous lines or do pointillism. But there isn't much more you can do with it.</p>
<p>In the opposite spectrum are your computer or your smartphone—they can virtually do anything, from drawing and writing to setting an alarm, sending emails, but they make doing something with focus harder than ever before.</p>
<p>How does your thought process change when you write with pencil and paper instead of typing on your laptop? When you read a book on Kindle instead of reading on your tablet? When you capture audio notes with a hand-recorder instead of using your phone?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Each essay of the series will use an object (or family of objects) as a source of inspirations to share stories and facts around finding focus in our age of distraction.</p>

On the other hand, if the screen is too small, they might miss some crucial details, causing them to lose their game.</p><p>In this article, you’ll know how to choose the best screen size based on your viewing distance and preferred resolution. Make sure you don’t miss it!</p><h2>Short Answer</h2><p>If you have a short viewing distance, a 24-inch monitor with a 1080p display is your go-to option. If you enjoy a bit longer viewing distance, you can opt for a 27-inch screen with a 1440p resolution.</p><h2>Aspects to Consider</h2><p>You should consider two things when picking the best screen size: viewing distance and screen’s resolution.</p><h3>Viewing Distance</h3><p>You may ask: “how can the viewing distance affect your gaming experience?”</p><p>It’d be best if you adjust the screen size to your home-gaming setup.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a competitive gamer, you need to be about 3-feet away from your screen to enjoy an excellent gaming experience. With such a short distance, your best option is a 24-inch screen. Otherwise, choosing larger options will put a lot of strain on your eyes.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Resolution is one of the essential aspects for pro gamers because if it weren’t good enough, they wouldn’t have that mind-blowing gaming experience, which makes them feel like the main characters of the game.</p><p>Another rule of choosing a monitor’s size is that large screens should have high resolution.</p><p>For instance, if you had a suitable viewing distance and decided to buy a 34-inch screen, the resolution shouldn’t be less than 4k (full HD).</p><p>Also, if you choose a 24-inch display, it’s not recommended that you go for a 4k resolution because the high resolution will slow down the game, as it’ll be too heavy on the graphic card.</p><h2>The Best Monitor Size for Gaming</h2><h3>21-inch Monitors</h3><div><figure><img src="https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors.png" alt="" srcset="https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors.png 284w, https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors-24x15.png 24w, https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors-36x22.png 36w, https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors.png 284w, https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors-24x15.png 24w, https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors-36x22.png 36w, https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors-48x30.png 48w" data-lazy-src="https://thegamingexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21-inch-Monitors.png"></figure></div><p>As a beginner, you won’t mind settling for such a small screen, but when things get heated, you’ll want more.&nbsp;</p><p>If you possess a 21-inch screen, you should sit less than 3-feet away.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. It is also a key basic unit to the quantum computer. Usually it could be visualized using a Bloch sphere.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to derive the connections between qubit and Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3 id="classical-bit">Classical Bit</h3>

<p>A classical bit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional classical system. A classical bit could only be in one state, either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal basis. Usually $| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\top}$ and $| 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\top}$.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-bit-qubit">Quantum Bit (Qubit)</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. A qubit is a superposition of two basic states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>A generic (normalized) qubit is of the form</p>



<p>where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are complex numbers, and $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$. After taking the measurement for $| \psi \rangle$, the system would be collapsed to $| 0 \rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $| 1 \rangle$ with probability $|c_1|^2$.</p>



<p>A complex number could be described using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Complex-Number-Representations/">exponential form</a>.</p>



<p>Where $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ are real numbers. Therefore,</p>



<p>We could rewrite $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ using a new parameter $\frac{\theta}{2}$. We would see why we used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ shortly.</p>



<p>We multiple a complex number $e^{-i\theta_0}$ to $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>We define $\varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_0$, we have</p>



<p>As we have discussed early in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-System-States/">quantum system states</a>, quantum system state $| \psi \rangle$ and $c | \psi \rangle$, where $c$ is any non-zero complex number, represent the same quantum system state. Since $e^{-i\theta_0}$ is a non-zero complex number, $| \psi \rangle$ and $e^{-i\theta_0} | \psi \rangle$ represent the same quantum system state. So we have</p>



<p>This means that, with two parameters $\theta$ and $\varphi$, we could determine a qubit state.</p>



<p>The next question is what is the minimum range of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ so that all the possible qubit states, $| \psi \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$s, are included? After taking the measurement of the qubit, the probability of observing $| 0 \rangle$ is $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ and the probability of observing $| 1 \rangle$ is $\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$. For different $\theta$s, if $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$s are the same, the qubit states, $| \psi \rangle$s, are also the same. Apparently, $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. If $\theta$ is out of this range, there is always a way to convert the $\theta$ into the range of $[0, \pi]$ while keeping $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ the same. For $\varphi$, there is not too much to say, $0 \leq \varphi &lt; 2\pi$.</p>



<p>To summarize, a qubit could be described using two independent variables.</p>



<p>Where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi)$.</p>

<h3 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.</p>



<p>Given the two-variable qubit formulation we derived above, it could perfectly fit into the Bloch sphere.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-14-Qubit-Bloch-Sphere/Bloch_sphere.svg.png">
    <figcaption>Bloch Sphere</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, respectively. Any coordinate, which could be uniquely described using $\theta$ and $\varphi$, on the sphere, represents a unique qubit.</p>



<p>It is also non-trivial to see that all the qubits on the equator, where $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, have equal probability of collapsing to $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, because $p(|0\rangle) = \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(|1\rangle) = \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>



<p>In addition, if the qubit is more closer to the north pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |0\rangle $ after taking the measurement. Similarly, if the qubit is more closer to the south pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |1\rangle $ after taking the measurement.</p>



<p>Moreover, an arbitrary pair of orthogonal qubits is mapped to antipodal (opposite) points of the Bloch sphere. This is because, any antipodal qubits have the following representations.</p>



<p>We would like to show that $\langle \psi , \psi^{\prime} \rangle = 0$ so that $| \psi \rangle $ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ are orthogonal.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Last but not least, to answer why we had used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ in the qubit representation, it is because we want to make the qubit representation compatible with the Bloch sphere. If using $\frac{\theta}{2}$, $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the Bloch sphere matches $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the qubit representation.</p>

<h3 id="manipulate-qubit-on-bloch-sphere">Manipulate Qubit on Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>As we have partially shown in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">one of my previous posts</a>, all the classical logical gates could be considered as matrices, and all the classical bit manipulations are matrix multiplications. This also applies to quantum logical gates and qubits. Actually, all the quantum logical gates are unitary matrices. We would take this fact for now and I would probably explain this in my future blog posts.</p>



<p>Matrix $U$ is unitary if and only if</p>



<p>Unitary matrix preserves inner products. If $U$ is unitary, then for any $v, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, we have $\langle Uv, Uv^{\prime} \rangle = \langle v, v^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>This could be easily proved by using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">inner product properties</a>.</p>



<p>This means that unitary matrix $U$ also preserves the norm of any vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>



<p>Suppose we have a qubit $| \psi \rangle$ and unitary matrix $U$. Because $| \psi | = 1$, so $| U\psi | = 1$. In addition, given the orthogonal basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, because $\langle |0\rangle, |1\rangle \rangle = 1$, so $ \langle U|0\rangle, U |1\rangle \rangle = 1$. This means that $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are a new pair of orthogonal basis.</p>



<p>On the Bloch sphere, applying a unitary matrix $U$ to qubit $| \psi \rangle$ is equivalent to moving the coordinate of the qubit on the Block sphere, since unitary matrix preserves the norm of vector. Apply a unitary matrix $U$ to both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ is equivalent to rotate the north and south poles, i.e. the coordinate system, accordingly.</p>



<p>If we look into $| U \psi \rangle$ more closely.</p>



<p>Since $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are also orthogonal basis, manipulating qubit is also equivalent to manipulating the entire coordinate system. The coordinates of $| U \psi \rangle$ in the new coordinate system ($U|0\rangle$, $U|1\rangle$) is the same to the coordinates of $| \psi \rangle$ in the old coordinate system ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$).</p>

<p>Goodness. The tech world must be really unfriendly, or alternatively I must be the absolute scum of the planet. Let's figure out what I did.</p>
<h2 id="indirection_is_not_abstraction">Indirection Is Not Abstraction</h2>
<p>Back in December of 2012, <a href="http://twitter.com/zedshaw" title="">Zed Shaw</a> wrote an essay entitled <a href="http://zedshaw.com/essays/indirection_is_not_abstraction.html" title="">Indirection Is Not Abstraction</a> (if link is <a href="https://wilkie.how/shaw_indirection.txt" title="">broken</a>). In this, Shaw notes that there are a few misconceptions about the definitions of several terms used to describe methods of modular design and code isolation: interfaces, abstractions, and indirection. Basically, he suggests that our fellow coders and engineers mix them up and conflate them with other concepts.</p>

<p>The article is clearly a bit of a work in progress, as noted by Shaw himself in the concluding paragraph. It is not particularly well-written or well-structured. Shaw uses a writing style that conjures this image of the ever irritating shock-jock. If there is something he doesn't like, he emphasizes with expletives. If there is <em>someone</em> he doesn't like, he will go out of his way to find the room to take a shot at them. For instance, later on, Zed Shaw manages to inexplicably slip in a link to a search for <em>"Dave Winer Asshole."</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s even worse
when the implementer realizes that if he implements the most complicated piece
of shit possible then he can go rogue consultant and make tons of mad cash
helping poor unsuspecting companies implement his steaming pile of bullshit.
Harsh words? You bet. But I’m fed up with people imposing their faulty
definitions and ideas on me without any way for me to easily fight back with a
reasonable explanation as to why their crap is steaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writing style is difficult to parse and makes the reader wonder how concise the article could be if such filler was removed. For instance, the paragraph above provides the motivation for the piece. You might believe, only knowing the intent of the article, that the motivation would be to provide a better structure for discussing modular design. However, Zed Shaw's stream of consciousness relays a motivation to provide a better means for him to tell you (male implementors, not women apparently) that your code is similar to excrement wasting away in the sunlight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unbelievable 6 levels of indirection just to add a fucking object to a fucking collection. This is the kind of bullshit that chaps my ass purple and makes me want to eat babies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and to prevent him from desiring the consumption of small children in this unbelievably lazy reference found later on. Sigh. People. Look. This isn't hard. Killing a baby is not a valid literary device. It does not invoke peaceful idyllic imagery that helps you make your point through nostalgia. Stop it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Zed Shaw hits some good points and gives some decent ideas about how to better describe what an abstraction is. Of course, this is done in a paragraph that was probably supposed to be a bulleted list because it has a bunch of random asterisks between each sentence, but, as I said, the content in that mess is actually very good. (Hint: he doesn't swear or talk about the color of his butt.)</p>

<p>Now let us focus on how I am involved. I research distributed systems and operating design. The whole indirection, interfaces, and abstractions thing? I'll let you in on a secret... That's what an operating system is. Therefore, I saw the gaps in an unfinished article and figured I had something useful to say. I gave the following post of my own in response to his article on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ja5ihv/indirection_is_not_abstraction/comments/nl5sy4" title="">lobste.rs</a>:</p>

<p><em>"I had no idea the terms were so misused! It’s pretty simple, though. You have interfaces… if the implementations change behind them, that doesn’t mean your interface is flexible. It just means you have essentially a commit history that the interface allows you to ignore. Therefore, interfaces are not abstractions. Java misuses the term ‘abstract,’ because their usage only has meaning at the language parse time where it implies the lack of implementation logic. However, at runtime, an abstract class does not provide an abstraction, but an interface. However, we conflate the term with the notion of usage abstraction.</em></p>

<p><em>"Zed does a terrible job at illustrating a true abstraction. Abstractions take away things. They simplify. They consolidate, perhaps, but they consolidate power through generalization. A programming language is an abstraction of a machine language. A machine language is an interface to the CPU’s control and arithmetic units. A machine language doesn’t abstract because it doesn’t limit.</em></p>

<p><em>"I’ll add that abstractions are generally not machine-driven. They are people-driven. We abstract because some interfaces are too complicated. We abstract with natural language. We want things to be easier for the sake of programmers. A programming language is an abstraction because ‘var i = j + 1’ is so much better than the machine equivalent, however we sacrifice something to do this. That’s generally a good test for determining which something is. API’s are interfaces (yes, duh), Frameworks/languages are abstractions (read as: should be)</em></p>

<p><em>"Zed doesn’t really talk about where the discrepancy comes from (because people are dumb isn’t really good enough.) What really gets people is that interfaces usually have implementations which make use of abstractions. So, this is also a question of scoping. An implementation can make use of an abstraction, however, an interface cannot force the usage of an abstraction (since an interface is just a name and a behavior.) A test for that is whether or not the implementation can eschew the abstraction by reinventing the universe to provide equivalent behavior. But looking at the wrong scope when you design can certainly lead to this problem of term discrepancy."</em></p>
<h2 id="zed_shaw_responds">Zed Shaw Responds</h2>
<p>Apparently the post was well-received enough to catch Zed Shaw's attention, which I suppose was my first mistake.</p>

<p><img src="https://wilkie.how/images/the-zed-shaw-phenomenon/zedshaw_3.png" title="" alt="!zedshaw"></p>

<p>Zed Shaw's response was not a very friendly one. He stripped my handle out of the reply to Steve and gives that common criticism of criticism: <em>"you didn't even read it."</em> Steve did that thing that your friends do when you are out with them and they run into some Cool People, and he started to distance himself from me like it was coincidence that I was in the same room. That was disappointing, but I agree with Steve's careful implication that it is a bit confusing that I could both repeat what Shaw said and yet in the same small post also suggest that he was wrong.</p>

<p>It felt very odd to see this conversation unfold with me as the topic without either giving me an opportunity to contribute. <strong>I felt a bit restrained as I didn't seem to have the authority to defend myself</strong>. Yet, overall I didn't particularly care. <em>"Oh well,"</em> I thought, <em>"I got my Zed-Shaw-Hates-You-Achievement. 10 Points."</em> The thing is, the comment I posted is very on point, which is all that matters when you write. You always anger somebody with your research. There is this expression people like to console you with resembling <em>"if you make people angry, you're doing something right."</em> But, in reality, some people are just really touchy when you are working on a similar project. I'm not sure if it is fear, or related to what territorial dogs do in the park, but it happens.</p>

<p>The important part is that my post is not wrong and I stand by it. The idea that interfaces should be considered first-class over abstractions because abstractions are always summarizations of a set of interfaces is an important idea. One that I believe Zed Shaw didn't really care about, so I made instead. But what if it wasn't me and it was somebody else? There must be others that are completely suppressed by this behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feel free to contact me with comments on this essay. It is still being worked on and is open for review. I’m pretty sure it makes no sense right now, but the major points should be there. I’m especially interested if you have any examples which you find relevant to the discussion, either for or against what I’m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, I have to say; I was scratching my head a bit by his reaction. If he suggests himself that the post makes no sense and that he invites comments including criticism, why was my post so ill-received?</p>
<h2 id="the_bully_mindset">The Bully Mindset</h2>
<p>Zed Shaw insists that I said he is wrong. I did no such thing. I agreed with many of his points. However, if I squint my eyes, I think I can see where that sentiment is coming from: <em>"Zed does a terrible job at illustrating a true abstraction."</em></p>

<p>Why would I use the word <em>terrible</em> ? Because it is true. But I'm not calling him wrong, rather I'm suggesting that the writing quality is poor, because it is. It was an incredible eyesore for one. Also, he illustrates many examples of awful, tedious object hierarchies and gives some decent definitions of the terms, yet, he does not give any examples of what in the real-world actually abides by those definitions. Therefore, I did. I felt that this was the weakest part of the work, and I described it as such.</p>

<p>So wait. Could it be, then, that Zed Shaw is offended by the word <em>terrible</em> ? Could it be that the same person who desires a means to call your code a pile of feces shrieks at such a negative adjective?</p>

<p>Let's catch up to the present. How did this come back up almost 8 months later? Recently Zed Shaw published an <a href="http://xoratelier.com/" title="">idea</a> where people would pay him to work on his projects. Kurtis Rainbolt Greene offered reasonable criticism of the structure of the program. In reply, Zed Shaw spouts a stream of expletives about how absurd Kurtis apparently is to him.</p>

<p>In frustration, Kurtis issues a status about how Zed Shaw attacked rather than reasoned, and I felt the need to express solidarity. This is very much my experience from before where criticism was met with immediate aggression. I tagged Zed's handle (something he didn't afford me.) When Zed replied to me, shocked that I would be so brazen, I pointed out the tweet where he had attacked my post while …</p></div></div></div>

I would even do round trips - fly to London in the morning, attend two client pitches and be back in Prague by night. Using low budget airlines that had frequent delays, I found myself leaving the house before 6 AM and coming back at 1 the next morning. I would work the whole time on the train, at the airport and sometimes even on the cab ride back home. Consequently, my mind was rushing with thoughts and I couldn't fall asleep despite the exhaustion.</p><p>Sometimes, I'd miss my return flight.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

                          <p><i><span>I have a great idea for a startup. The only thing I’m still hesitating about is hiring a CTO. It’s particularly important for me because I don’t know the tech side. Outsourcing the technical part to an </span></i><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><i><span>MVP development agency</span></i></a><i><span> is one of the ways to check your idea, let’s look at the other.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Well, this article will answer the question.</span></p>
<h2>CTO as a part of MVP development team</h2>
<p>CTO (also known as Head of Engineering) is a person who is involved in making the most important technical decisions.&nbsp; They play a significant role in your project triumph since they decide on the tech stack used for the future product (suitable frameworks and technologies), plan the app infrastructure, and control the whole process of MVP development.</p>
<p>In general, a good CTO is a skilled developer with knowledge in programming that is just enough to create and launch MVP. If you find out how to hire a CTO for a startup, you won’t have to seek any other developers (at least at the very beginning).</p>
<h2>What exactly does CTO do at the MVP stage?</h2>
<p>We say, ‘a CTO is one of the most important parts of the MVP team’.&nbsp; Don’t you believe it? Let us justify this statement (and disclose to you how to hire a CTO for a startup).</p>
<p>To do this, we will touch on the steps of MVP development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="3084" height="1417" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01.png 3084w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01-300x138.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01-768x353.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01-1024x470.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3084px) 100vw, 3084px"></a></p>
<p>We’ll start by assembling a minimum MVP team. Based on the objectives given in the preceding paragraph, we need programmer and designer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to create a design concept</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet active sketching and wireframing is not really up to CTOs and it is the found designer who is responsible for generating a design concept, they still have control over the process. The CTO not only introduces the concept requirements to the designer and helps them understand the product vision but also makes sure the concept is technically feasible.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes designers develop a beautiful concept that is not easy to accomplish because some aspects require sophisticated technologies. And you surely won’t be happy with the situation when you have to google something like ‘we’ve got a not technically feasible design concept. what to do with that?’, so let the CTO check it first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go on with a prototype</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though prototype designs often don’t look anything like the final product, they require skilled and knowledgeable overwatching too. To consider all additional features and changes that the start-up plans to introduce over time (so that designers could think through the prototype, and developers could later include everything without changing the layout significantly) is part of the CTO’s duties too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proceed with UI/UX design</li>
</ul>
<p>UI/UX design demands a forward-thinking approach. Here the head of engineering serves as the central point for technical decisions: they validate the complexity of the design realization and choose technologies.&nbsp; But prior to deciding on the tech stack, they conduct TFS (Technical Feasibility Scan): draw up a potential architecture, estimate the amount of work, and identify technical risks (such as scalability, complexity, or need for rare skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep down in coding</li>
</ul>

<p>When the tech stack is chosen, the developer comes into play. Or not.&nbsp; If your CTO and your developer are the same person (which is more likely), it will still be the CTO.&nbsp; However, in case the CTO does not have all the skills or time for realization, they will enlist the help of a third party company or a freelancer. Tip for you: make sure you know how to hire a CTO for a startup before hiring an ineffective one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make QA testing run in parallel</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing and coding come together. While the code is being written, the CTO begins checking the result. They are involved in so-called alpha testing conducted at the development stage and fixing bugs.</p>
<h2>How to hire a CTO for a startup?</h2>
<p>Let’s consider five common scenarios:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng-.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng-.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="680" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng-.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng--300x146.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng--768x373.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng--1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<h3>I will do it all by myself</h3>
<p>On the one hand, you won’t need to hire a tech specialist, which will save you money. On the other hand: You won’t learn any programming language fast. According to the statistics, it takes about 3 months only to learn the BASICS of coding. You certainly can learn it faster (or slower) but it’s still a highly questionable matter since coding takes ‘a moment to learn, a lifetime to master’.</p>
<p>Besides, the average time for creating a complete MVP version including all the activities is 3 months. Is it really worth spending so much time on learning just one skill?</p>
<p>If you are an enthusiast who has an interest in learning coding and has no fear of facing difficulties, then it will be okay. However, if you are not, then you should think twice before setting about buying books and software development courses and downloading Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you tried to learn a programming language.&nbsp; After several months of struggling you realize you don’t want it anymore. By ‘it’ we mean not only coding but also your project.</p>
<p>And, yes, there is no way competitors will wait for you. Time to market matters a lot, and if you don’t seize the occasion, it’ll be seized by someone else.</p>
<h3>Got a techie friend!&nbsp; He is ready to work for free and gonna take care of coding</h3>
<p>What can be better than working with your friend who you’ve known for many years?&nbsp; ‘Nothing’, some of you would say — well, this is a common misconception.</p>
<p>Do you think you can trust each other?&nbsp; It’s not going to be like this in business.&nbsp; Why? &nbsp; For everything is bound to get personal.</p>
<p>Once you trip over something relating to the project, you may have different points of view on it You would probably have to go through hours of disputes before coming to a mutual agreement.</p>
<p>There is always another thing: you would have quarrels about money and equity sharing. Matter of money is where the hell starts because your CTO may start thinking he/she does more than you. ‘It’d be better if I found out how to hire a CTO for a startup’, you are likely to yell.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Eduardo Saverin who was the Facebook co-founder? He no longer works there. Almost right after the website was launched, the relationship between co-founders began to fray: they couldn’t come to an understanding, and Zuckenberg cut his friend out of the company.</p>
<p>If you are sure your friend and you won’t get in a situation very similar to this, you can offer them to join your project.</p>
<h3>I will hire a first-class PRO CTO</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng-.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng-.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="680" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng-.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng--300x146.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng--768x373.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng--1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>How to hire a CTO for a startup? Lure in a pro, of course! (spoiler: no way)</span></p>
<p>In most cases, a first-time startup owner wants to hire an ‘all-in-one, best in the entire industry’ CTO: the person with strong programming and management skills, with a wealth of experience in commercially successful projects.</p>
<p>In fact, you can find such CTOs. Except that it’s likely that true pros already work in well-established companies, of course. Now let’s think a little bit: will a real pro be willing to barter away their position with a good salary in exchange for working with you and waiting for the day when a startup will become profitable? Hardly possible. If such CTOs are ready to leave their previous work behind, then it’s a question of competence.</p>
<p>Non-tech founders are especially susceptible to the idea of having an in-house associate due to a lack of experience in this sphere. But there’s actually no need to hire an in-house CTO for your startup at this stage. It’s much easier to get a professional who will run the technical side of your future product than to get them into your office.</p>
<h3>I heard something about freelancers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="680" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9-300x146.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9-768x373.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9-1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>There is always someone ready to do it cheaper</span></p>
<p>When hiring a freelancer, it is essential that you are not struck blind only with the price. It may be pretty attractive to get a good CTO for less but you can never be dead certain you’ll get a proper product.</p>
<p>Working with a freelancer is full of tricky points ‘cause freelance itself is unsteady. First, it’s a complicated task to find a needed person for non-techies.&nbsp; Yeah, you can see the portfolio which is obviously awesome but there is no way you may be one hundred percent sure this person knows all the technologies you need. With freelancers, it’s easy to underestimate the scope of work. Would you like to find out that you need to find one or even more programmers to hire in the middle of the MVP development process and go beyond the budget?</p>
<p>It’s okay for this market that a freelancer may leave you without even saying goodbye. They can easily drop working with your project if they win something more gainful for them. ☺</p>
<h3>Nah, I’m gonna outsource the technical part to an agency</h3>
<p>If you are still hesitating about finding a CTO for your startup, we find outsourcing to be the best solution for startups.</p>

<p>As you may know, there are companies focused on MVP development. And what will you get when outsourcing your project to such a company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to portfolios. That’s where studying ‘done’ projects makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="988" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6-300x212.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6-768x542.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6-1024x723.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>Check out projects relevant to the industry you plan to jump into</span></p>
<p>While developing a similar product outsourcers gained a lot of knowledge: found the biggest pain points, discovered possibilities and limitations on a particular market. These learnings allow them to deliver a truly working product satisfying customers’ needs, which makes outsourcing the best answer to ‘how to hire a CTO for a startup’.</p>
<ul>
<li>You receive competent advice on the tech-stack: if you don’t know which technology to choose — a company will tell you what’s on trend.</li>
<li>You get a team with deep expertise in smooth product implementation. Try to find guys who work in accordance with Agile principles and have time-proven tactics of design, development, and execution.</li>
<li>You have a project manager who will be the ‘nanny’ of the whole project.&nbsp; This person will not only take care of solving pop-up-problems but also bring together those who work with code and those who create a design.&nbsp; You won’t have to be in Zoom 24/7 and settle problems.</li>
<li>Your budget will be understood and the whole product backlog will be prioritized.&nbsp; As a result, the ‘done’ app will have thoroughly picked up features just …</li></ul></div></div>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-datetime.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>Gates was having an informal meeting with Steve Shaiman, a cheerful gnome of a man with a head of frizzy hair who was general manager of Microsoft’s hardware division, and with Raleigh Roark one of the two people who had started the division. They were talking about fonts and applications, especially Word.</p>

<p>Roark gave Gates his answer: For printers, basically. This was the era of desktop publishing and proliferating office applications, and users needed more than just the bitmapped system fonts on their computers to get their work done. Courier, Tms Rmn, and Helv were not going to be enough. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is known for asking hard questions, but also for accepting hard answers and acting on them. As soon as he got his answer, he pointed at Steve and told him: “Now you run type!”</p>

<p>That’s the way things worked at Microsoft in those days, says Shaiman: whoever knew the most about a subject tended to end up in charge of it. So he ended up starting Microsoft’s first fonts group. It was Spring, 1989.</p>

				<h2>The conquest of TrueType</h2>
			</section>
			
			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-phone.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN was on a business trip to Atlanta with Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s celebrated head of advanced technology, when they got an unexpected phone call. Myhrvold had with him a satellite phone—an early mobile phone, “which in those days,” as Shaiman put it, “meant something you’d carry in a suitcase.” The unexpected call was from Apple.</p>

<p>At that time, Adobe Systems dominated the digital font market, with its PostScript technology built into Apple’s LaserWriter printers, and with PostScript firmly established as the preferred format for high-quality fonts. Microsoft needed to find its own format and its own fonts if it didn’t want to be dependent on Adobe.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft, Apple was trying to find ways to license the PostScript language from Adobe, or to find an alternative. The Apple call was about font technology: Apple was developing its own font format, TrueType, as an alternative to PostScript, while Microsoft acquired a program called TrueImage, a potential PostScript clone, which Apple was interested in. How about a trade?</p>

<p>Shaiman says that his and Nathan Myhrvold’s reaction was immediate: “Sure!”</p>

<p>Ironically, once Microsoft got hold of TrueType, they loved the concept but didn’t like the way it was implemented. Although they ended up only making slight modifications to the version that shipped with Windows 3.1, when it came time for the next version of Windows, they ended up “throwing out Apple’s code and rewriting it from scratch.”</p>

<p>When Microsoft and Apple publicly announced their collaboration on TrueType at the Seybold conference in September 1989, the announcement was handled in a contentious and aggressive manner that antagonized Adobe and famously brought Adobe’s John Warnock to tears of frustration. Steve Shaiman feels now that it was a poor way to do it: “We couldn’t have done worse.” Although they were demonstrating what they felt was better technology, they made the mistake of shoving it in Adobe’s face. “What we really needed,” he says, “was a good PR person who could have helped us come up with a less aggressive approach.” But the deed was done. The “font wars” were in full swing.</p>

<p>The key developer of Microsoft’s new code was Eliyezer Kohen, whom Myhrvold met at a conference in Switzerland. Eliyezer was, as Steve Shaiman put it, “really, really smart.” He had a PhD from ETH Zurich, where he studied with Hans Eduard Meyer, the designer of the font Syntax, and Niklaus Wirth, designer of the Pascal language; and he developed his own technology for creating scalable fonts. Eliyezer, according to Shaiman, was “a Turkish Jew with a German wife, who wanted to move to the United States, as one or the other of them wasn’t welcome in any country in Europe where they might find decent working conditions.” Microsoft happily brought him in.</p>

Hitchcock is tall, blond, and slow-spoken; he doesn’t fit the image of the high-energy Microsoft employee, and he may seem unassertive, almost tentative, if you see him only in a neutral context. But when you see his attention snap to the subjects he knows and cares about, he is forceful and precise, and very, very knowledgeable. His memory is encyclopedic, and he has been at the heart of Microsoft’s typographic development for more than a quarter century. Today he manages Microsoft’s Advanced Reading Technologies (ART) team.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft had been dealing with fonts in one way or another from the very beginning (even a DOS screen needs a font to display its text), Hitchcock feels that the story of typography at Microsoft really begins here: When the first outline fonts were created for Windows 3.1, in 1990.</p>

<p>It was all brand-new technology. All fonts up until then had been bitmap fonts, crude forms made up of coarse screen pixels in a vague approximation of what real letters looked like. Although Microsoft’s new effort was driven by purely practical needs—mapping the screen fonts on a computer system to the fonts available on a printer—Hitchcock feels that it was also the beginning of thinking about screen fonts as something useful and readable in themselves.</p>

<p>The members of the virtual team came from all over Microsoft: Dennis Adler (Fonts), Jean-François Peyroux (OS/2, and later Windows), Michel Suignard (Windows International), Greg Hitchcock (OS/2), Eliyezer Kohen (Fonts), David Weise (Windows), Tim McCaffery (Windows), Raleigh Roark (Hardware), Gabe Newell (Printing), and later Ben Bauermeister, an outside consultant, whose “PANOSE system” for classifying typefaces by their visual characteristics (rather than their historical roots) might provide a roadmap between screen and print.</p>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-shake.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN hired Dennis Adler to manage the fonts groups.&nbsp; Together, they talked with several potential sources of font libraries and font technologies, including most of the big guns in the field. Linotype, the venerable manufacturer of hot-metal typesetting equipment, which owned the rights to, among others, the very popular typeface Helvetica, was being hard-nosed. “Fonts were seen as incredibly valuable at the time,” says Shaiman, “and Linotype’s attitude was, ‘What’s Microsoft going to do for us?’” So they were asking an enormous price for licensing the fonts. And Microsoft didn’t want to license the fonts; it wanted to own the rights. (When Shaiman told me this, he laughed and proclaimed: “Microsoft doesn’t rent things!”)</p>

<p>Monotype, on the other hand, was much more receptive. Monotype was Linotype’s great rival; between them, the two companies had essentially created the business of mechanical typesetting in the late 19th century, with their competing hot-metal composition machines. But the Monotype Corporation had fallen on hard times. The typography division, the only part of the company working on digital fonts, was making money, but the larger machinery business was hemorrhaging cash, and the parent company was about to declare bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Out of that debacle rose a new type-only company, Monotype Typography Ltd, which was essentially the old typography division reconstituted as an independent business.</p>

<p>The new company, with its focus on digital fonts and information technology, was headed by a German, Rene Kerfante, who had joined Monotype in 1987 to head up the typography division, and an American, Ira Mirochnik, who had been Monotype’s chief financial officer. They were both quite ready to negotiate a deal with Microsoft.</p>

<p>So it was Monotype that began developing a set of “core fonts” for Microsoft: Scalable TrueType fonts that could be shipped with Windows and used freely by every Windows customer. The new fonts had to mimic the established core set of PostScript fonts, which included Times Roman and Helvetica. Since Monotype had originally developed the Times fonts back in the hot-metal days, that part was easy. To compete with Helvetica, though, they chose to adapt an earlier Monotype design with similar characteristics, called Arial.</p>

<p>Designing the outlines for these typefaces was the kind of task that the Monotype drawing office excelled at. The hard part was the hinting, the software instructions that control the rendering on various devices. That was what would make the fonts look good on screen.</p>

<p>Monotype had a team in the UK working on font hinting, but they were running into trouble. Although they had an auto-hinting program, called TypeMan, developed by Apple’s principal TrueType developer, Sampo Kaasila, the process was proving to be long, slow, and laborious. As Greg Hitchcock describes it, Monotype in desperation Monotype “sent out the bat signal.” In response, in September 1990, he and Eliyezer made the first of many trips to the UK to provide hands-on help and supervision. This was the start of a back-and-forth pattern for Greg—three weeks in the UK, one week in Redmond—that lasted for the next nine months. Their main job was hinting type, working in little rooms in archaic buildings at the old Monotype works. …</p></section></article></div>

      <section>
      <p>In the <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/461104.The_Ascent_of_Man">Ascent of Man</a></em>, mathematician Jacob Bronowski describes a conversation in London with the legendary John von Neumann, some time after von Neumann published his <em>Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour</em> with Oskar Morgenstern in 1944.</p><p>“You mean, the theory of games like chess?” Bronowski asked, after they had settled into their London cab.</p><p>“No, no,” von Neumann replied, “Chess is not a game. Chess is a well-defined form of computation. You may not be able to work out the answers, but in theory there must be a solution, a right procedure in any position.”</p><p>“Now, real games,” he said, “are not like that at all. Real life is not like that. Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory.”</p><p>Bronowki was a chess player; von Neumann a poker player. His book on game theory included a chapter called ‘Poker and Bluffing’ — by all accounts, von Neumann played poker only occasionally, and not very well at that. But he recognised that poker was a fundamentally richer game than chess, and he built his theory around a stripped-down version of the game.</p><p>Decades later, professional poker player Annie Duke retells this story in her book <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking in Bets</a></em>, and argues:</p><blockquote>The decisions we make in our lives—in business, saving and spending, health and lifestyle choices, raising our children, and relationships—easily fit von Neumann’s definition of “real games.” They involve uncertainty, risk, and occasional deception, prominent elements in poker. (…)<p>Chess, for all its strategic complexity, isn’t a great model for decision-making in life, where most of our decisions involve hidden information and a much greater influence of luck. This creates a challenge that doesn’t exist in chess: identifying the relative contributions of the decisions we make versus luck in how things turn out.</p><p>Poker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. (Not coincidentally, that is close to the definition of game theory.) Valuable information remains hidden. There is also an element of luck in any outcome. You could make the best possible decision at every point and still lose the hand, because you don’t know what new cards will be dealt and revealed. Once the game is finished and you try to learn from the results, separating the quality of your decisions from the influence of luck is difficult.</p></blockquote><p>Duke gets it mostly right. In her book, she argues that we have more to learn from poker than we do from chess. In chess, whenever we make a mistake, it is possible to pinpoint what the mistake was, and when during the game it was made. But in poker, as in life, mistakes and outcomes may sometimes be unrelated — for instance, it is possible to blunder in poker and yet still win against a world champion; conversely, it is possible to ‘play perfectly’ and lose the entire game.</p><p>Learning in poker is also more reflective of the real world: at the highest levels of chess, making a mistake leads to an observable, predictable outcome that you may study; in poker, you may play a hand but have your opponents fold; this means you walk away with no idea if you played well or badly.</p><p>Duke’s solution, of course, is to focus on explicit decision analysis. Poker demands that we learn probabilistic thinking, and it requires us to separate the evaluation of our outcomes from the quality of our decision making. <em>Thinking in Bets</em> covers many of these techniques, and Duke now teaches her methods to business executives beyond the world of poker.</p><p>Duke’s book is very much in line with mainstream decision theory. The book argues that our brains are evolved for less complex environments, and that we rely on heuristics — mental shortcuts! — that cause us to have cognitive biases. In turn, these biases lead to errors in judgment that prevent us from achieving our goals.</p><p>This might not be surprising to you, especially if you’ve spent any time reading up on decision making — if you have, in addition to Duke’s book, read Daniel Kahneman’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=pOsNtVC7Nm&amp;rank=1">Thinking: Fast and Slow</a></em>, if you’ve gone through Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-do-you-evaluate-your-own-predictions/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, or if you are familiar with Richard Thaler’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge"><em>Nudge</em></a>. These authors argue that the best response to this quandary is to find ways to work around our brain's deficiencies, in order to make ever more rational judgments and decisions.</p><p>In simple terms, if you have read only these books, you would likely conclude that &nbsp;<em>heuristics should be frowned upon.</em> Heuristics lead us to cognitive biases, which in turn prevent us from making good decisions; good decisions are necessary to achieve our goals; therefore, we should be suspicious of the heuristics we lean on if we want to succeed in life.</p><h2 id="but-heuristics-are-how-we-think">But Heuristics Are How We Think</h2><p>Over the past four weeks, we’ve gone through a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">series of posts</a> on the nature of tacit knowledge, and how this is related to the pursuit of expertise. In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/">Part 2</a>, for instance, I described the recognition-primed decision making (RPD) model as a model for tacit expertise, and gave several examples of using it to extract the tacit knowledge of experts. In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/youtube-learn-tacit-knowledge/">last week’s post</a>, I talked about how an understanding of RPD might help us extract tacit knowledge from YouTube — YouTube! — in fields as diverse as Judo, computer programming, and music.</p><p>But sharp readers might have noticed that RPD <em>is completely dependent on heuristics</em>. As Gary Klein writes in <em>Sources of Power</em>:</p><blockquote>The core of the RPD model is a set of heuristics previously described by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman: the simulation heuristic (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124">1974</a>), used for diagnosis and for evaluation, and the availability and representativeness heuristics (<a href="https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;ots=YEjd4PX1WN&amp;dq=Causal%20schemas%20in%20judgments%20under%20uncertainty%20fosjbeom&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">1980</a>), for recognizing situations as typical.</blockquote><p>In fact, the only explicit analysis that occurs during the recognition-primed decision cycle is when you’ve pattern matched the situation against a prototype in your head, and you’ve moved on to the evaluation and generation of an action script.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/07/Paper.Commonplace.41.png"></figure><p>This view of decision making is quite different from the previous one. In the previous view, heuristics are suspicious. In this view, <em>heuristics are simply how our brains work.</em> In fact, when someone tells you to acquire expertise, what they’re really saying is “go lean into your heuristics”! And when an expert tells you “it just felt right”, what they’re really saying is that they pattern matched against what is available to them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability bias</a>); they made sense of the developing situation by generating a narrative (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201612/what-is-narrative-bias">narrative bias</a>), and then they executed a solution they had simulated in their heads (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_heuristic">simulation heuristic</a>).</p><p>For all the attention that Duke spends on explicit decision analysis in poker, <em>actual</em> poker performance seems to be as dependent on prototype recognition and expert intuition as chess is. As <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340342482_Poker_as_a_Domain_of_Expertise">Palomaki et al, 2020</a> notes:</p><blockquote>A corpus of anecdotal evidence suggests that since the poker environment is complex and fast paced, players need to trust their intuitions or “gut feelings” when making a decision (e.g., Brunson, 2005; Tendler, 2011). These feelings can also be called affective heuristics (Finucane et al., 2000) —that is, “unconscious” processing of task-relevant information experienced phenomenologically as good or bad “feelings” about a situation. It has been empirically established that chess masters, too, often rely on an intuitive “feel” for different moves and assessment of the “board as a whole,” especially in the mid-game where options for various moves are astronomical (e.g., Chassy &amp; Gobet, 2011; Gobet &amp; Chassy, 2009) and it is futile to attempt to work through the alternatives step- by-step in working memory.</blockquote><p>And then they quote World Series of Poker champion Doyle Brunson, who says:</p><blockquote>Whenever I . . . “feel” . . . I recall something that happened previously. Even though I might not consciously do it, I can often recall if this same play . . . came up in the past, and what the player did or what somebody else did. So, many times I get a feeling that he’s bluffing or that I can make a play and get the pot. [My] subconscious mind is reasoning it all out.</blockquote><p>Which is similar to the kinds of things that experts say whenever you ask them about their tacit knowledge.</p><h2 id="putting-the-two-together">Putting The Two Together</h2><p>So how do we square these two views together? The unsatisfactory answer here is that I don't yet know.</p><p>In 2009, Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein published a paper titled <em><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Conditions-for-intuitive-expertise%3A-a-failure-to-Kahneman-Klein/fe7716fa80fcf7cea3ac71666754360c77197f42">Conditions for intuitive expertise: a failure to disagree</a>.</em> In it, they outlined the history of their respective approaches, and then argued that expert intuition may <em>only</em> be trusted when:</p><ol><li>The environment has high <em>validity</em> — that is, when there are adequate valid cues that may be learnt in the environment, and</li><li>There are sufficient opportunities to learn those relevant cues.</li></ol><p>In giving these two requirements, Kahneman and Klein argue that domains like political forecasting and stock picking fail requirements 1 and 2, while domains like chess, medicine and firefighting, do not.</p><p>(As an interesting aside, they <em>also</em> argue that domains with high levels of uncertainty or information hiding may still be considered high validity — and here they give the examples of poker and warfare. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340342482_Poker_as_a_Domain_of_Expertise">Palomaki et al</a>, on the other hand, argue that poker is ‘medium validity’, because poker's short-term outcomes are highly dependent on luck.)</p><p>Kahneman and Klein’s paper is probably one of the most important papers to have come out of the naturalistic decision-making and heuristics+biases academic traditions — but it is only useful up to a certain point. What we <em>really</em> want to know is how Annie Duke — and others like her — are able to blend the analytical rigour of decision analysis with the rapidity of recognition-primed expertise. Can we generalise their methods to other skills? And if so, how do we adapt them to our careers?</p><p>I don’t yet know the answers to these questions, or what they imply for successful stock pickers and hedge fund managers — two roles …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Early mornings are pristine, they're my favorite time of the day. As the sun
keeps coming up earlier and earlier, I find myself waking up at 6. Rather than
do anything else, I either go for a run or skate, or I grab a book and a cup of
coffee and read.</p>

<p>Mornings are usually my most creative time. I have a clear head that allows me
to think freely and focus on the kind of work that requires attention and
creative thinking. That means I write, or work on strategic topics relevant to
the company, or I read the occasional article, book or paper too. In different
times, I'd write code during these hours.</p>

<p>This time usually stretches beyond breakfast, until around noon. After that,
there's meetings (I only schedule meetings after noon), one on ones, and
increasing chatter and activity around the office.</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>the number of distractions increases as the day goes by.</strong></p>

<p>These kinds of distractions aren't necessarily a bad thing. Meetings, one on
ones, office chatter, they all have their place, and they're all important. All
of them are at least half of what my job entails these days.</p>

<p><strong>But how does email fit into all of this?</strong></p>

<p>As soon as you open email, your attention gets sucked away from everything else.
As you go through your inbox, you're faced with all kinds of problems,
questions, feedback, vendor requests, meeting notes and invites. Your attention
span shortens with every email you process, deciding on whether it warrants a
response, being careful about your own responses along the way.</p>

<p>Usually, after I plow through my inbox, afterwards I have little attention span
left to focus on a single task. Instead I now have dozens of other topics in my
head that drain my focus pool, commanding my creative resources away from work
that requires my full focus.</p>

<p>The same is true about Twitter. You're immediately sucked into other people's
bad days (or good days) and cat pictures, luring your focus away from yourself
and your day. </p>

<p>The temptation of email is great and hard to resist. When you're done working
through your inbox, you have that great feeling of accomplishment. Only then do
you realize that you still have other work to do and that your meetings for the
day aren't too far off.</p>

<p>Time slips, and so does your focus work.</p>

<p><strong>But I'm the CEO, and people need to communicate with me!</strong></p>

<p>They do, and everyone's welcome to step up to my desk or ping me online (if I'm
in chat). Most things that come up in those first hours of the day, though, are
things that I can follow up on later. That's the important part. It's the
following up that matters rather than wanting or getting an immediate response.
Especially in remote and distributed teams, communication is asynchronous.</p>

<p><strong>So when do I read my emails?</strong></p>

<p>I schedule blocks every day, when I focus only on email. This doesn't always
work, but having this explicit schedule does magic beyond having a specific
time. It gives me the mental freedom to focus on important work. I know that I
have my slot for email later, and I have it every day. Instead of worrying about
an ever-growing inbox, I know that every day I'll have a slot in my calendar
that allows me to focus on email and email only.</p>

<p>Try this out for a week. Instead of opening email in the morning, open your
notebook and write down two or three tasks that you want to get done before
lunch. Then work through them. What you can get done in just two hours and by
focusing only on work is pure magic.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting.

Still can't bear the sticker shock of your very own Talos II, or even a itty bitty Blackbird? Why not do what we all do for the machines we can't own and emulate one instead? (And then decide you like it a lot, and save your pennies?)
</p><p>
QEMU 5.0.0 offers a machine model for the bare-metal PowerNV profile, to which the Raptor systems and other OpenPOWER POWER8 and POWER9 designs intended for Linux (i.e., not PowerVM machines) belong. Using the Talos II firmware image (mostly: one snag to be mentioned), you can boot the machine in QEMU and from there bring up an operating system in emulation. In this article we'll prove it works by bringing up <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power</a> (hi, Daniel!) in a variety of configurations. A set-up like this might be enough to test that your software or open-source package builds and runs on OpenPOWER, even if you don't own one yet. In a future article we'll talk about how you can boot your own code on the metal so you can port your favourite OS or build a unikernel.
</p><p>
(For the purposes of this article I'll assume an audience that isn't as familiar with OpenPOWER terminology as our usual readership. Kindly humour me.)
</p><p>
The emulation is imperfect, both if you're emulating it on a real Raptor family system or on an icky PC. While QEMU can emulate an AST2500 (i.e., the ARM-based Baseboard Management Controller, which acts as the service processor and provides the video framebuffer), and QEMU can also emulate a PowerNV system, it doesn't do both at the same time. That means the very lowest levels are actually being simulated here -- you can't watch Raptor's pretty Hostboot display, for example, and only the barest functions of the BMC are simulated enough to allow bring-up, not including the framebuffer. In fact, the hardware profiles we will use here do not in general match a real Raptor system either: we're just virtually plugging in PCI devices that give us necessary functionality, though of course none of the peripheral devices in a Raptor system is Raptor-proprietary. Finally, even though I have tagged this entry with KVM, KVM currently doesn't work right with the QEMU PowerNV machine model even though I'm pretty sure it should be technically possible. Sadly, I tried in vain to do so, could never get KVM-HV to be happy, and ended up kernel panicking the machine with KVM-PR. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/0b95d7bea3e9a270385a2360fbcf7f40">See if you can triumph where I have failed</a>. In the meantime, naturally you can do everything here on a T2 or Blackbird as well because that's how I did it writing this article, but there is no special acceleration for those systems right now.
</p><p>
The first order of business is the first order of business with any emulator: get the ROMs. Fortunately, no one is going to bust you for pirating a set of these because we're an open platform, remember?
</p><p>
The two pieces required are Skiboot and Petitboot, both of which live in the system's PNOR flash. <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a> contains OPAL, the OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer. It comes in after the BMC has turned on main power and started the Power CPUs' self-boot engines, which then IPL ("initial program load") Hostboot for the second-stage power-on sequence. When Hostboot completes, it chains into Skiboot, which initializes the PCIe host bus controllers (PHBs) and provides all the basic hardware calls needed by a guest kernel to support the platform. You can think of it as something like an overgrown BIOS. This is the lowest firmware level of an OpenPOWER system that QEMU currently supports emulating.
</p><p>
Skiboot lives only to service a kernel, so it immediately starts one. This initial payload is the bootloader for <a href="https://github.com/open-power/petitboot">Petitboot</a>, which is also stored in firmware. Petitboot has a small Linux root (Skiroot) and acts as a boot menu, finding bootable volumes on attached devices or over the network. Having found one (or you select one), it chains into it to start the main OS, and from then on Skiboot will provide platform services via OPAL for this final guest until the system is shut down or restarted. Because it's in firmware, Petitboot is always available, which can come in really handy when you're trying to do system recovery.
</p><p>
The first, best and most dedicated way is to <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">build Skiboot and Petitboot yourself</a>. They are open-source and the process is relatively well documented and automated, and you should know how to do this if you own an OpenPOWER machine anyhow. If you aren't doing this on a real OpenPOWER machine you'll need a cross-compiler, but most Linux distros offer such a package nowadays. Do keep in mind that if it looks like you're building a tiny Linux distro, well, that's because that's exactly what you're doing. The advantage here is you can fool around with the firmware at your leisure, but it requires a bit of an investment in disk space and time.
</p><p>
The second way assumes you have a more casual interest and would prefer to go with something prefab. It's possible if you (or, you know, your "friend") has a Raptor-family system to extract the necessary components right from the BMC prompt. Log into the BMC over SSH (or via <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/04/what-to-do-when-bmc-wont-talk-to-you.html">direct serial connection</a>) and type <tt>pflash -i</tt>. You'll see a list of all the partitions stored in the PNOR flash. The ones we want are <tt>PAYLOAD</tt> (which contains Skiboot) and <tt>BOOTKERNEL</tt> (which contains Skiroot and Petitboot). The exact addresses may vary from system to system and firmware to firmware.
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# pflash -P PAYLOAD -r /tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD" from 0x021a1000..0x022a1000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%<br>
root@bmc:~# pflash -P BOOTKERNEL -r /tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL" from 0x022a1000..0x03821000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%
</tt></p><p>
We skip the first 4K page to avoid the wrapping around each partition. <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> is actually compressed and needs to be uncompressed prior to use, so:
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# cd /tmp<br>
root@bmc:/tmp# xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Finally, <tt>scp</tt> both <tt>skiboot.lid</tt> and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> to your desired system from the BMC.
</p><p>
Admittedly we just talked at length about the two ways most of you <em>won't</em> get the firmware, so let's talk about the third method and the way most of you will, i.e., you'll just download it. Currently there is an irregularity about Raptor's present Skiboot build for this purpose: it only boots if you are emulating a single <em>POWER8</em>. That's not a typo. If you use it to boot an emulated POWER9, the guest will simply panic, and the guest will go into a bootloop if you are emulating multiple POWER8 CPUs (necessary if you need a larger number of PCIe devices). This is undoubtedly a QEMU deficiency which will be corrected in future releases. In the meantime, if you just care about playing around using a single POWER8 on a terminal, then Raptor's builds (either from BMC flash or downloaded) will suffice. However, if you intend to emulate a POWER9 or SMP POWER8 system, <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/pc-bios/skiboot.lid">download QEMU's own pre-built <tt>skiboot.lid</tt></a> and use that instead.
</p><p>
For Petitboot, we will extract that directly from Raptor's PNOR images. Assuming you didn't get it using the process above, <a href="https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Talos_II/Firmware">download the current Talos II PNOR image</a> and decompress it. In the <tt>shell_upgrade</tt> directory you will see the <tt>bzip2</tt>-compressed PNOR image. Uncompress that, leaving you with a filename like <tt>talos-ii-v2.00.pnor</tt>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/4a2c907d0acec5b537cd4992a00801c3">Download my <tt>pnorex</tt> extractor tool</a> (it's in Perl, because I'm one of <em>those</em> people) and run it on the PNOR image:
</p><p>
<tt>% pnorex talos-ii-v2.00.pnor<br>
Version 1 PNOR archive with 33 entries.<br>
Extracting PAYLOAD at offset 8601.<br>
This is a xz format image.<br>
Wrote 1020K successfully.<br>
Extracting BOOTKERNEL at offset 8857.<br>
This is an ELF executable image.<br>
Wrote 22012K successfully.<br>
Extracted 2 partitions successfully.
</tt>
</p><p>
If you will be using Raptor's Skiroot, then uncompress <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> to <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> as above: <tt>xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Now, with <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> (for this first example, either Raptor's or QEMU's) and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> in the same folder, grab an ISO you want to boot. I used the prefab one Daniel offers on the <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power site</a> since I know it boots fine on OpenPOWER hardware. For our first example let's do a simple example of booting Void from a CD image on a POWER8 using the serial port. Our QEMU command line:
</p><p>
<tt>
qemu-system-ppc64 -M powernv8 -m 4G -cpu power8 \<br>
        -nographic \<br>
        -bios ./skiboot.lid \<br>
        -kernel ./pnor.BOOTKERNEL \<br>
        -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci0 \<br>
        -drive id=cd0,media=cdrom,file=void-live-ppc64le-musl-20200411.iso,if=none \<br>
        -device ide-cd,bus=ahci0.0,drive=cd0
</tt>
</p><p>
This configures a single-processor POWER8 system with 4GB of RAM, no graphics, and an Intel AHCI host controller with a single CD-ROM drive attached. The serial output should go to your terminal. It goes a little like this:
</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Here we are with Skiboot chaining into Petitboot. You can ignore the errors; there will be a lot of them since the platform is still incomplete. It will take a little bit of time to decompress the kernel (much slower than it would be on a regular system). You will notice a single device attached to the three available PCIe host bridges on the single POWER8 CPU, i.e., the host controller itself. Don't you just love that the vendor code for Intel is <tt>8086</tt>?
</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
This is Petitboot. When the bootable choices appear, cursor up to the starred option and press E before it autoboots, because we need to tell Void its console is the on-board serial port (otherwise it uses a VGA console: not sure whose bug that is).
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Add <tt>console=hvc0</tt> at the end, cursor down to <tt>OK</tt> and hit RETURN/ENTER a couple times to boot.
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
A successful login on your emulated baby POWER8. Ta-daa! To rudely pull the plug on the QEMU session, press Ctrl-A, and then X (<tt>QEMU: Terminated</tt>).
</p><p>
Let's now load out the POWER8. We would like to add a video card, an Ethernet card and a USB controller to our existing system, but POWER8 Turismo chips only offer enough PHBs for three PCI endpoints. How do we solve this problem? Easy: we'll add another processor!

<p>Last month, the Google AI blog released an article called “Federated Analytics: Collaborative Data Science without Data Collection”, delving into a mode of data science that doesn’t depend on centralised data collection. What I noticed as I was reading it was a heavy handed subtext around privacy. A ctrl+f for ‘privacy’ brought the word up thirteen times – the subtext was very much ‘at Google, we think about privacy’. But what makes this particularly interesting is that decentralised data analysis isn’t a new concept and didn’t find its origins in privacy, where Google had introduced systems for distributed analysis as early as 2014. While it’s not unusual for Google to put out content expounding some of its technical methods and processes, this article is an intentional signalling of the company’s evolved baseline perspective. Basically that privacy is a forefront concern and consideration in all its avenues of pursuit, this being just one of the many bricks in its united front against user-data related backlash.</p>

    <h3>Resealing and Upgrading Trim on a '78-'90 Volvo 240 Windshield</h3>
    <h4>13 Jun 2018</h4>
    <p>The 1990 and earlier Volvo 240 windshields are known for their frustrating trim design which was held on 
by <a href="https://www.volvopartswebstore.com/products/Volvo/240/Clip-kit-Genuine-Classic-Part/1113962/270148.html">22 plastic clips</a>, 
set into the butyl rubber used to mount the windshield. My 1989 240 developed a leak near the top right of the 
windshield due to a combination of rust and shoddy resealing done by the previous owner.</p>

<p>Rather than try to bodge some silicon sealant into the leaky areas and buy myself another couple of years, I chose to fully remove the windshield and 
re-glue it with urethane, replacing the chrome trim strip and clips with more modern rubber trim at the same time.</p>

<p>Using a piece of braided steel wire and two dowels as handles, I sawed through the existing urethane after poking a hole with a exacto knife to feed the wire through.
What was waiting for me underneath was not pretty.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-04-28%2013.08.22.jpg" alt="Rusty Pinchweld"></p>

<p>The pinchweld had rusted enough that there was no choice but to cut it out in several places and weld in new sheet metal:</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-03%2016.47.01.jpg" alt="Grinding out pinchweld"></p>

<p>I used a dremel with a cutting disk to remove the old metal and TIG welded in a patch with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2ya1l1F">AHP AlphaTIG 200X</a> (this job is what finally pushed me to buy it).</p>

<p>As I welded small sections, I used an air gun to cool the back side of the pinch seam to avoid setting the dashboard on fire. I kept a fire
extinguisher close by at all times regardless.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-03%2019.21.18.jpg" alt="New windshield corner"></p>

<p>I masked off the entire area and painted it with <a href="https://amzn.to/2JH2C1r">Rust-Oleum professional primer</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Rust-Oleum-Professional-High-Performance-Enamel-Spray/35031494">high performance enamel</a>. 
The silver Rust-Oleum just happens to be a very close color match to the silver on the 240.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-04%2019.47.02.jpg" alt="Masking"></p>

<p>Considering the horrific condition of the windshield seam before the job, the result isn’t half bad:</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-05%2020.55.08.jpg" alt="After painting"></p>

<p>Next, I had to answer a question that I couldn’t find clear information on anywhere on the internet. Is it possible to re-use a pre-‘90 style windshield 
but replace the trim with the more modern glued rubber? The answer is <strong>yes</strong>. 
You do not need to buy a whole new ‘91+ windshield if you already have an older pane of glass in good condition.</p>

<p>I bought some <a href="http://www.gggcorp.com/Universal_Mouldings.html#OriginalT">Gold Glass Group Universal Moulding T107B</a> 
on Ebay in a 15ft. roll and applied it to the edge of the old style windshield instead of the clips and chrome trim.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2018.07.48.jpg" alt="Applying Trim"></p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2018.08.02.jpg" alt="Applying Trim Closeup"></p>

<p>A test fit confirmed it fit into the windshield opening perfectly. I think moving from the 0.75” T107B to the 1” T109B trim would have been a good move, to better
cover some of the nasty surface where the old trim sat. During the test fit I made some marks around the perimeter to help locate the 
windshield later when I installed the urethane.</p>

<p>I bought two tubes of <a href="https://amzn.to/2HLgUfO">DOW U-428 Plus Primerless Windshield Adhesive</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2JJCxii">air powered caulk gun</a> and 
laid down a bead about 9mm tall on the seam. The air powered caulk gun was absolutely essential; the U-428 is so thick that you could never
extrude it from a hand powered gun. I had the regulator on my compressor at nearly 60 PSI to get it to flow. I only ended up using one tube, but this isn’t the kind of job you can afford to run out of adhesive 90% of the way through!</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2018.49.28.jpg" alt="Applying Urethane"></p>

<p>With a helper, I lifted the windshield in and set it in place. We made final position adjustments and taped it in place with some blue tape. 
For the temperature and humidity of my location, Dow calls for at least 5 hours of cure time before drive-off.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2019.06.36.jpg" alt="Blue tape"></p>

<p>Overall, a pretty long process but nothing an experienced garage fabricator couldn’t do on their own. The final result doesn’t look too bad:</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-14%2012.44.17.jpg" alt="Finished image"></p>

<p>I’m sure it’s a horrible misuse of the urethane, but I had a few grams left over, so I used it to glue the perpetually falling off glovebox back together:</p>

We have created our proprietary DNP Score to help visualize the risk involved with owning and operating a website on a particular domain name. DNP Score is similar to an individual's credit score or a company's business rating.
</p><p _ngcontent-sc269=""> Many different risk factors are involved when you own an internet domain name. Risk factors can impede or literally halt the ability to use a particular domain name for commerce. Certain factors can potentially lead to theft of the domain name, loss of the domain name to another party, or cause a significant loss of internet traffic to the website on that domain name. Other issues such as domain ownership disputes, being put on email blacklists, malware, or being de-listed or banned in internet search engines can cause problems and loss of revenue.
</p><p _ngcontent-sc269=""> DNProtect's DNP Score takes many different risk potential risk factors into account. Our proprietary DNP Scoring system collects the necessary risk data, processes that data, and assigns a value (positive or negative) to each risk factor. The scoring system then calculates the resulting DNP Score for each domain name. The DNP Score is based on a scale of up to 750 points. Every domain name begins with a median score of 400. Then, positive risk factors and negative risk factors are applied to the score. A higher DNP Score means that the domain name has less risk overall. A lower DNP Score means that the domain name has more risk.
</p><p _ngcontent-sc269=""> It's important to own an internet domain name that has a higher DNP Score because the higher the score the less risk is involved. If you are using that domain name for your website and/or email, then a higher DNP Score means that you minimize the risk of having your website go down, having your email stop working, and your website traffic and sales go down.

<p>Implementing HTTP’s uniform interface&nbsp;as discussed in the previous <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pradeeploganathan.com/2016/09/20/rest-communicating-with-verbs-and-status-codes/" target="_blank">posts</a> has a surprisingly good architectural side effect. If it is Implemented as specified in the REST specifications (HTTP specification – RFC 2616), you get two useful properties namely Idempotency and Safety.</p>



<h3>Safety</h3>



<p>Safety is the ability to invoke an operation without&nbsp;any side effects arising out of the client invoking&nbsp;that operation. It means that the client can invoke an operation&nbsp;with the explicit knowledge that it is not going to change the state of the resource on the server. However, it does not mean that the server should return the same response every time. The server can also perform additional actions when these methods are invoked such as logging calls or incrementing counters etc. but these should not change the state of the resource being acted upon. Generally, read only methods are safe methods. GET, HEAD and OPTIONS are safe methods.</p>



<h3>Idempotency</h3>



<p>Idempotency means that the effect of doing something multiple times&nbsp;will be the same as the effect of doing it only once. A simple example from Math’s&nbsp;would be the effect of multiplying any number by One. In math the number 1 is an idempotent of multiplication. e.g. 5 x 1 = 5 which is the same as 5 x 1 x 1 = 5. Similarly, an API operation that sets a user’s name is a typically idempotent operation. Whether it is called once&nbsp;or multiple&nbsp;times, the effect of the operation is that the user’s name will be set to the target value. Deleting a resource is an example of this distinction; the first time you invoke the delete, the object is deleted. The second time you attempt to delete it, there is no change in the state of the system, but the object remains deleted as requested. An idempotent operation generates no side effects.</p>



<p>Idempotency results in improved reliability, concurrency, prevents data loss and provides the ability to automatically retry /recover from failures. It improves reliability by providing the&nbsp;ability to safely retry requests that may or may not have been processed. This helps tide over network glitches and load spikes by replaying requests. Load balancers like HAProxy can retry requests when the server disconnects abruptly providing automatic recovery from failures. Since API calls are idempotent multiple API calls can be run concurrently without locks and mutexes to synchronize operations on data. This increases concurrency and system throughput resulting in better performance.</p>



<p>Safety and Idempotency let a client make reliable HTTP requests over an unreliable network. If you make a GET request and never get a response, just make another one. It’s safe even if your earlier request was fulfilled since&nbsp;it didn’t have any real effect on the state of the resource server. If you make a PUT request and never get a response, just make another one. If&nbsp;your earlier request got through, your second request will have no additional effect since PUT is&nbsp;idempotent and the operation can be repeated.</p>



<p>The following table lists shows you which HTTP method is safe, and which is&nbsp;idempotent</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>HTTP Method</th><th>Safe</th><th>Idempotent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;GET</td><td>&nbsp;Yes</td><td>&nbsp;Yes</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;POST</td><td>&nbsp;No</td><td>&nbsp;No</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;PUT</td><td>No</td><td>&nbsp;Yes</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;DELETE</td><td>No</td><td>&nbsp;Yes</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;HEAD</td><td>Yes</td><td>&nbsp;Yes</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;OPTIONS</td><td>Yes</td><td>&nbsp;Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT&nbsp;and DELETE requests are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it’s gone. If&nbsp;you DELETE it again, it’s still gone. The response codes in the above two requests can differ to indicate that the resource representation being deleted is gone. Two simultaneous Delete requests may result in the first request getting a 200 (OK) and the second request&nbsp;getting a 204&nbsp;(NO CONTENT).If you create a new resource with PUT, and then&nbsp;resend the PUT request, the resource is still there and it has the same properties you&nbsp;gave it when you created it. Making an absolute&nbsp;update to a resource’s state or deleting it outright has the same outcome whether&nbsp;the operation is attempted once or many times. Again, a PUT request can have differing return codes based on the validation done. It can be a 200 (OK) for a successful PUT or a 409 (Conflict) for a PUT where the server resource state is different from the one referenced by the client. A GET or HEAD request should be safe: a client that makes a GET or HEAD request&nbsp;is not requesting any changes to server state. Making any number of GET requests&nbsp;to a certain URI should have the same practical effect as making no requests at all. The safe methods, GET and HEAD, are automatically idempotent as well. POST is neither safe nor idempotent. Making two identical POST requests&nbsp;will result in two subordinate resources containing the same&nbsp;information.</p>



<p>Developing API’s requires us to adhere to the REST semantics which specifies the safety and idempotency requirements for the various verbs as shown in the table above. API consumers will and should expect GET to be safe and idempotent. Similarly, API consumers will incorporate logic to manage additional factors since POST is neither safe nor idempotent.</p>

        <div>

  

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

CLXVI; western entrance of the Tachara of Darius (sketch by author), Persepolis; two reliefs on the Apadana, Persepolis (photo by author)</p></div>
<p>  If you look at modern paintings and miniatures, you would think we have a good idea of the type of shield used by Achaemenid infantry in the time of Darius and Xerxes.  They cite <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.61&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126">Herodotus book 7 chapter 61</a> and show the large rectangular kind on the middle row of the picture above.  But as I argue in chapter 6.5.2 of my forthcoming book from Franz Steiner Verlag, things are more complicated.  These large rectangular shields appear on the doorposts of two buildings at Persepolis and on two or three vases from Athens (out of thousands of soldiers at Persepolis and Susa and thousands of Red Figure vases). The person who published the sketch on the middle left thought it showed a battle against the Phrygian allies of the Amazons.  And this type of shield does not agree with Herodotus’ words that quivers were hanging beneath the shields, unless we understand ‘beneath’ quite loosely.<br>
<span id="more-7332"></span></p>
<p>  The type in the top row is also popular with artists, but it seems specific to the Aegean/Sea of Marmara/Black Sea region.  Warriors of all the different nations in this region used small round, rectangular, or crescent-shaped shields, often made of wicker or covered with goatskin, but we do not see these shields in artwork from the heart of the empire.  Its also hard to imagine these forming a barrier which needed to be knocked over after a long struggle, like Herodotus describes.  But they are the type of shield which artists from Athens most often put in the hands of foreigners, probably because the Athenians were a bit provincial and Thracians and Scythians were the most exotic warriors they were familiar with.</p>
<p>  The type in the bottom row is the most common type at Persepolis, but it does not show up in Greek art at all.  This might be because it was too similar to the Boeotian or dipylon or figure-eight shield and Greek artists felt that it did not say ‘barbarian.’  A bronze boss for such a shield was found at Samos.  It is easy to imagine quivers hanging beneath such a shield, but hard to imagine them forming a solid barrier which needed to be pushed over.  </p>
<p>  We see even more types of shield in art from the empire, such as the small round center-grip shield on the Çan sarcophagus or the big deep round wicker shields carried by ?Thracians? at Persepolis.  But these three types in the three rows are the ones people today are most interested in.</p>
<p>  Diodorus describes the Persian shields at Thermopylae a bit differently than Herodotus describes them at Plataia (11.7.3, my translation) “For the barbarians used small <em>aspides</em> and <em>peltai</em> which were advantageous in broad open spaces, being easy to move, so because of the narrow space they were not able to harm their enemies very well because they were packed close together with their whole bodies covered with the great <em>aspides</em>, while being at a disadvantage because of the lightness of their defensive arms, they suffered wound after wound.”  He seems to imagine Persian warriors using <em>peltai</em> like the barbarians in paintings (Xen. Cyr. 1.2.13)</p>
<p>  People in my lifetime have written a lot of nonsense about wicker shields supposedly being ‘light’ or ‘weak.’  I don’t know of any tests of this, and traditional wooden shields tend to be thinner and lighter than people expect (like 8 mm thick wood plus a layer of linen or parchment in the centre, and 3-5 mm thick wood plus a layer of linen or parchment at the edge).  Modern wooden shields often use heavy plywood and rawhide so the shield can stand up to pounding with blunt weapons: the fact that these shields are unnecessarily heavy is not important because the owners don’t have to march 20 miles with them on their backs, camp, cook dinner, and march 20 miles again.  Tough warriors like the Ottoman Turks used wicker shields and I don’t know of any of their opponents who said that these were poor protection.  Also, until about the time of Xerxes’ punitive expedition against the Ionians-beyond-the-sea, Greek art often shows spearmen with a light figure-eight shields (Dipylon shields, Boeotian shields) which may well have been made of leather or wicker.  Neither art not archaeology shows that all Greek “bearers of spear and shield” in 480 BCE carried a heavy Argive shield and a single long thrusting lance.</p>
<p>  The type of shield in the middle row is the best fit for Herodotus’ descriptions of combat, but not the most common type in art, and it does not match his description of how Persian soldiers were armed.  And as we saw, <a href="https://bookandsword.com/2019/07/06/provisions-loin-girdling-and-battle-gear-in-the-long-sixth-century/">lists of equipment for soldiers in Babylonia</a> do not seem to mention shields at all.  So like a lot of things in ancient history, the idea that Xerxes’ men carried large rectangular wicker shields is our best guess based on pretty thin evidence, not something certain.</p>

<p>I became a better version of myself by taking a gap year after my freshman year of college. 6 years later, I am in the middle of a second gap year. I am convinced taking a gap year is one of the best things a person can do. Here is basically why:</p>



<p>A gap year is an opportunity to do what you like. When you can do what you like, you learn what you like to do. It is good to know what you like to do. It feels great to do what you like.</p>



<p>You can do anything in a gap year. You can start a business. You can start a blog. You can travel the world. You can live somewhere new. You can run a marathon. You can lose 30 pounds. I know you can do these things and more because I did.</p>



<p>I am happier, healthier, and wealthier than I would have been without a gap year. I am smarter and wiser. I am more positive and grateful. I have a better sense of purpose. I have a better set of habits. I make better decisions. They make me a better person.</p>



<p>Of course, if you are not convinced on the greatness of the gap year, you can always pay full tuition for the opportunity to volunteer in your college’s upcoming online experiment.</p>



<p>If you are past college like I am, I have one more thing to tell you. It is never too late.</p>

<h2 id="eliminating-one-of-the-darker-sides-of-capitalism">Eliminating one of the darker sides of capitalism</h2>

<p>There’s no reason companies should keep salaries a secret.</p>

<p>If salaries are determined rationally, according to principles that everyone in the company would agree to, then there’s nothing to hide.</p>

<p>When salaries are hidden, employees can be paid much less than they’re worth. The underpaid employees won’t know they’re underpaid. So they won’t ask for a raise, and they won’t go looking for another job.</p>

<p>If salaries are public, employees will know their true market worth. More importantly, they’ll know their <em>potential future</em> market worth which lets them make informed life choices.</p>

<p>Your salary can have a huge impact on your life trajectory. It’s most people’s only source of income. It determines where you can live, what house you can buy, how often you can travel, when you can retire and how much time you get to spend on hobbies, personal projects or with family and friends. If you have kids, it determines how much you can spend on them too.</p>

<p>But salary information is still so opaque that people can’t effectively plan their financial future.</p>

<p>When I was a fresh computer science grad, I had no idea what salary to expect when applying for software engineering jobs. I got a couple of offers and accepted one from a London tech startup.</p>

<p>But after a year at the startup, I wanted to see what else was out there. I applied to Facebook and got an offer that was double my current compensation. I was blown away and counted myself lucky to stumble onto this information early in my career.</p>

<p>An old colleague also had no idea what he could be making if he switched jobs. He recently joined Facebook too and tripled his salary. It’s significantly changed his life trajectory. But here’s the crazy thing — if I hadn’t told him what he could be making at Facebook, he still might not have known. He still might be making 3x less than he is now.</p>

<p>It’s sad to think that many will be in this situation for years. They’ll spend a significant part of their life working for a company that is underpaying them. And this is mainly due to keeping salaries secret.</p>

<p>In most other parts of our life, we know what’s out there and how it compares to what we have. When we buy a car, we can compare the options objectively and make an informed decision. When we buy a house, we can do the same thing. The market is mostly fair and efficient because information is readily available.</p>

<p>But the choice that impacts people the most — the job that determines their financial future and what they spend most of their prime waking hours on — is not given the same treatment.</p>

<p>Companies have intentionally hidden salaries to make the labour market unfair and inefficient. They exploit this inefficiency by underpaying their employees so they can make more money. This is a darker side of capitalism which should be eliminated. Consider that we already send people to jail when they exploit nonpublic information in the stock market.</p>

<p>Sharing your own salary makes the labour market fairer and more efficient. It opens people’s eyes to their true market worth, but more importantly, their <em>potential future</em> market worth.</p>

<p>For a student, having the right information can alter their life trajectory. Knowing the market value of different skills can inform what they choose to study and specialize in. The same is true for working professionals.</p>

<p>Compensation at Facebook is mostly formulaic and everyone is pretty open internally about how much they’re paid. But not much is shared externally. If you want to explore tech salaries for yourself, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a> is a great resource.</p>

<p>In the next post I’ll break down my own software engineering salary at Facebook.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a hack that will put you on the fast track to success at work, I have something for you.</p>



<p>You might not like it.</p>



<p>You might hate it.</p>



<p>You might even despise it so much that you do the opposite.</p>



<p>But sometimes we all must take our medicine and do what it takes to move onward and upward.</p>



<h3><strong>Going Against the Grain of Going Against the Grain</strong></h3>



<p>I know, I know. Since I started this blog, I’ve been doing a lot of railing against the idea of working for someone else. While I do not back down from my stance one bit, I do realize that not everyone <em>wants</em> to work for themselves. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and a lot of studying on the topic of work, and I feel confident enough to divide the workforce into three camps:</p>



<p><strong>Group A: The small percentage of people who love their jobs</strong>. People in this camp find meaning and enjoyment in the work they do, and their salary is comfortable enough to support their preferred lifestyle. Kudos to these people! They have found the nexus between their version of meaningful work and financial freedom. To achieve this outcome is the ultimate purpose of why I write about <em>work</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Group B: People who hate their jobs and are looking for an alternate path</strong> to meaningful work and financial freedom. Finding suitable answers for these folks is my primary objective, and I find myself in the unique position of creating my own answer to this problem in the process.</p>



<p>There is a third and under-represented camp: <strong>Group C, the silent majority</strong>. These are people who don’t like one or more aspects of their job, but simply don’t feel the need or the urge to venture out on their own. If you find yourself in this camp, this article is for you.</p>







<h3><strong>The Status Quo Is Unacceptable</strong></h3>



<p>If you read <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/05/ordinary/">How to be Extraordinarily Ordinary</a>, you’ll see my disdain for the status quo on full display. That post was a bit tongue in cheek, but I will not mince words in this post.</p>



<p>There are a million and one reasons for someone not to like their job. Ranging from pay rates to petty office politics. From specific job functions to Pam from three cubicles way receiving preferential treatment. From not enough hours to too many hours. The list never ends. But one thing is for certain: <em>very few grievances are ever made known to those with the power to change it.</em></p>



<p>The rest are suppressed, hidden from sight, slowly growing into intense misery. This intense misery subsides after a while into dull indifference and acceptance. Selfishness and the “what’s in it for me” mindset sets in, and newer employees are quickly influenced to follow the same path. This is the life cycle of status quo acceptance.</p>



<p>What I learned as an employee is that arranging a work environment conducive to happiness and success is not as hard as you would think. If you simply take the time to sit down with management to lay out your grievances, most of the time you can work something out. And in the rare instance they are not willing to work with you, then it’s a clear sign that you probably should move on.</p>



<p>What I learned from <em>leading</em> 80+ restaurant employees is that disgruntled employees are an inevitable part of managing such a complex system. There are so many moving parts in a large organization that you won’t be able to please everyone all the time. But the astonishing part is that most grievances will go undiscussed, no matter how open the door is. Employees who do not speak up will be condemned to their displeasure, and will inevitably poison the well. For those employees, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>



<p>In order to give success and happiness at work a fighting chance, you cannot accept a status quo that does not work for you. But <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">if you find that you cannot extract yourself from the situation</a>, your only choice is to lean into your work.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Get Ahead at </strong><strong>Work</strong></h3>



<p>I’ve been on both sides of the fence and have experienced both perspectives of what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem#:~:text=The%20principal%E2%80%93agent%20problem%2C%20in,entity%3A%20the%20%22principal%22.">Principal-Agent Problem</a>. To put it simply, the principal (the owner or boss) has the incentives to do what is best for the good of the firm. The agent (the employee) often only has incentives to do what is best for themselves.</p>



<p>The norms of mediocrity have made this dichotomy an unfortunate reality. Most agents just don’t care enough about what the principal cares about. Different incentives, different goals.</p>



<p>As an agent who is committed to the firm, your best path forward is to <strong>think like the owner</strong>. It is the one thing you can do to guarantee getting ahead. When your aspirations are aligned with those of the owner, you instantly put yourself on the fast track to success.</p>



<h3><strong>Think Like an Owner and You Will Become the Owner</strong></h3>



<p>On the spectrum of happiness, those people closest to maximal happiness tend to be the ones in control of their own destiny. This simple fact is why I have repeatedly advocated for you to take an alternate path, take ownership of every aspect of your life, and leave the crowd behind.</p>



<p>If working for yourself is not an option in your mind, then your only option for true success and happiness at work is to lean into your work and <em>be excellent</em>. To be excellent in your workplace:</p>



<ul><li>Never say “that’s not my job.”</li><li>“How can I help” needs to become an instinct.</li><li>Become a leader within the organization, regardless of your title.</li><li>Don’t wait for someone to tell you to do the work that needs to be done.</li><li>Avoid petty workplace politics.</li><li>Take ownership of everything you do. No excuses.</li><li>Be consistent. The principal has to show up every day, and so should you.</li></ul>



<p>To illustrate this, I’ll tell you about an employee, who worked for me at the restaurant I managed, named Mike. Mike personified every single item on the above list. He was a college student and a busser, but he was so meticulous, so consistent, and so reliable that he earned the nickname “Cap,” as in Captain America.</p>



<p>I was so impressed by his work ethic and attitude, that I offered to promote him on more than one occasion. He turned down my offer every time because he believed what he was doing was the most effective way for him to help the restaurant.</p>



<p>The job wasn’t glamorous, but he leaned into his responsibilities in a way that earned him freedom, trust, and a sense of meaning in his work.</p>



<p>I’m confident that because he thinks like an owner, Mike will one day become an owner.</p>



<h3><strong>The Clear Path Ahead</strong></h3>



<p>There is a clear path to controlling your destiny within the confines of working for someone else. This path is not easy, you might not like it initially, but it will yield the most satisfying results over the long run.</p>



<p>By operating from a position of abundance, by going the extra mile to help others look good, by inspiring and lifting others around you, you will stand out above the rest over time.</p>



<p>I’ll finish with a quote from Naval Ravikant, who sums it up nicely: “If you think like the owner, and you act like the owner, it’s only a matter of time until you become the owner.”</p>



<p>###</p>

<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/future-past-draw.png"></p>
<p>After some reflection with friends and colleagues I can’t help but observe an odd fact:</p>
<p><strong>the Future of Data Science is Past</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t because data scientists try to predict the past (which granted, is pretty funny and ironic). It is also because hype and other circumstances have turned data science into a field of inflated expectations. It feels more like a certain type of dream got pushed (even sold) that didn’t solve all the problems that people were hoping for.</p>
<p>After I started hearing that a lot of data projects fail (here’s a nice example on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/beoxx8/discussion_when_ml_and_data_science_are_the_death/">reddit</a>) I started thinking about what was going on. Five years ago the future was so bright that some of us may have been blinded by it. In short, the hype around algorithms forgot to mention that:</p>
<ul>
<li>algorithms are merely cogs in a system</li>
<li>algorithms don’t understand problems</li>
<li>algorithms aren’t creative solutions</li>
<li>algorithms live in a mess</li>
</ul>
<p>In this document I’d like to address these points one by one so that I have something to refer to. I realise that I sound a bit cynical but I’ll end the blog with some hope.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-are-merely-cogs-in-a-system">Algorithms are Merely Cogs in a System</h2>
<p>I was once put in a team to design a recommendation service for the Dutch BBC. One of the first things we did was make a drawing of what the service should look like. It looked something like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/main_setup_numbers.png"></p>
<p>There were different parts of this design:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The UI layer</li>
<li>The AB splitting mechanism - we need this is we ever want to compare two algorithms.</li>
<li>The database that caches recommendations - we need this because at scale we cannot calculate these in real time</li>
<li>The scheduler that triggers a cluster to make calculations - we want to incorporate new data on a daily/hourly basis</li>
<li>An algorithm that calculates new recommendations - this is the data science code that takes log files and produces recommendations</li>
<li>The fallback/checker mechanism that ensures we only recommend things we’re allowed to recommend.</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of all these parts the final part (#6) is the most important in this system. It is the part that guarantees that we always have something to recommend even if any part before breaks. It is also the part that ensures that we always adhere to some very important business rules. Business rules like;</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure that we don’t violate a license (some content may only shown during certain parts of the day)</li>
<li>make sure that we don’t show mature content before 22:00</li>
<li>make sure we don’t recommend violent shows after a kids show</li>
</ul>
<p>It is unrealistic that a self learning algorithm is able to pick up these rules as hard constraints so it makes sense to handle this elsewhere in the system. With that in mind; notice how the algorithm is only a small cog in the entire system. The jupyter notebook that contains the recommender algorithm is <strong>not</strong> the investment that needs to be made by the team but rather it is all the stuff around the algorithm that requires practically <em>all</em> the work. Note that step 5 also requires communication with a big data cluster which also demonstrates that a recommender is more of an engineering investment than an algorithmic one. You don’t want a pure scientist team here, you need solid engineers and developers.</p>
<p>This is besides the fact that a lot of good algorithms can be created with simple heuristics that don’t require a maths degree. One could:</p>
<ul>
<li>recommend content that is often watched together</li>
<li>recommend content that is often watched together unless it is too popular</li>
<li>recommend the next episode</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all fair options to at least benchmark. I would also like to point out that the latter idea is a great idea even it isn’t technically machine learning. It should compete with any deep learning algorithm, any day.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-dont-understand-problems">Algorithms don’t Understand Problems</h2>
<p>It takes a team a lot of time to realise what problem it is actually solving. Getting this right is hard. It’s even harder when the majority of the team consists of the same people. Worse; these people are trained in machine learning and prefer to keep themselves to the algorithmic part of their work.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/circle-half.png"></p>
<p>Thing can go wrong in this situation. The team might not be great at translating the actual problem into an algorithm that represents the business. At the same time, the business might not be able to adapt to a recommendation that comes out of the algorithm. Even worse, it is also possible that the algorithmic solution brings in new problems. If you’re unlucky these new problems can get translated into new algorithmic problems. Before you know it you’re stuck in a loop.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/circle-full.png"></p>
<p>People with an algorithmic background usually tackle a problem in isolation of the system that it is in. A better approach is not to focus on the isolated part but to focus on the communication between two parts of the system. If this is not part of the problem design from the get-go then you’re bound to waste resources until you realise it has to.</p>
<p>Let’s remember the recommender usecase. It is a bad idea to expect the algorithm to magically understand that it cannot recommend mature content before 22:00. When you realise this you know that you need a checking system between the algorithm and the serving layer. It is good to realise this early in the project and not when a large chunk of the code needs to get rewritten.</p>
<p>One potential cure against this “isolation” way of thinking is to not have a team with data people. Instead you want to have teams that are interdisciplinary and maybe have a data person in it. A team with many backgrounds causes more discussion and a more holistic view of things that “might go wrong”. It makes sense to have a UI specialist, a backend engineer, an algorithm person <strong>and</strong> a content expert in a team that is making a recommender.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/better-worse.png"></p>
<p>It is really hard to think outside the box if your in it. By having multiple disciplines you ensure that there is always somebody who can cause a pivot. There’s always somebody who thinks outside of the box that you’re in.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-arent-creative-solutions">Algorithms aren’t Creative Solutions</h2>
<p>Creative solutions to problems are usually not found by hyper-parameter search. The goal should not be to be the most efficient algorithm but the most effective. Do data teams ever consider that maybe the solution to the problem <strong>isn’t</strong> a machine learning model? Why would the algorithm ever be a good starting point to solving a problem?</p>
<p>To drive this point I’m reminded of a story in the eighties about a condom brand. The business was doing well but it was having some trouble planning production. It turned out to be very hard to predict demand. Both the factory and the warehouse are expensive so people were wondering what to do about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/timeseries-1.png"></p>
<p>Then a strategic consultancy firm came in and suggested that this was indeed a <strong>StatisticsProblem[tm]</strong>. The consultancy firm advised getting another third party involved to try to predict the demand curve. A small army of econometricians was brought in to tackle the business case.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/timeseries-2.png"></p>
<p>After two months (and many billed hours) the econometricians reported that no progress was made. The timeseries turned out to not show any predictable patterns that could help with the planning of either the factory or the warehouse. The original consultants and econometricians left (pockets filled) while they reminded their client of the NDA they all signed.</p>
<p>After a few weeks an alternative way of thinking made it’s way to management and it came from a factory worker. The problem turned out to be formulated incorrectly. The factory did not need to be turned off if the company had products to produce. It merely needed to look for a product that it could produce when demand for condoms was low. If it could find a product that correlates negatively with the original product then the factory might produce all year round.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/timeseries-yes.png"></p>
<p>Supposedly, this is how latex pacifiers got invented.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/baby-pacifier.png"></p>
<p>The issue with this fable is that it is very hard to verify it’s truth. Still, one might wonder what would happen if we allow ourselves to solve problems without algorithms for a change.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-live-in-a-mess">Algorithms Live in a Mess</h2>
<p>From the perspective of a data scientist life is pretty easy. One gets to play in an isolated environment of historical data. One get’s to do this from a jupyter environment that somebody else set up. One even gets to use very complex algorithms by calling <code>model.fit()</code> followed by <code>model.predict()</code>. Lot’s of charts are made, metrics are compared and maybe a model is pushed to production.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/rockstar.png"></p>
<p>This is in stark contrast with businesses. Businesses are not confronted with problems that are in isolation. Businesses instead have dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. To repeat what is said <a href="https://ackoffcenter.blogs.com/files/the-future-of-operational-research-is-past.pdf">here</a>; I call such situations messes. Problems are abstractions extracted from messes by analysis; they are to messes ’as atoms are to tables and chairs. We experience messes, tables, and chairs; not problems and atoms.</p>
<p>This is especially true when we consider that the world is a moving target. Optimality is usually of short duration and this is especially true if the consequences of the algorithm aren’t too well understood (who knows what happens when we call <code>.fit()</code> or <code>.predict()</code> given enough columns) or if the algorithm can’t be changed easily.</p>
<p>It get’s worse. The type of model deployed in our field implies a particular paradigm of problem solving. It consists of two parts: predicting the future and making a decision based on this. The effectiveness here depends on how well we can predict the future as well as our ability to act on it. The fact that you can predict something (churn, the weather) does not mean that you can act on it. The fact that you can act on it does not mean that it is predictable.</p>
<p>If we can make good decisions based on predictions then we have another problem: we will cause a shift in the world. This might be great for the short run but it will render our future predictions futile. If we don’t see a backlash in predictive power then our algorithm might cause a way worse problem: self fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/the-future-is-past_files/rockstar-not.png"></p>
<p>This algorithmic attitude towards problem solving often leaves …</p></div></div>

Naming is communication.
Going bananas with naming microservices?
Probably something you will regret!
This post proposes a few guidelines to follow when naming internal applications and components.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>Developers seem to enjoy using clever, cute, funny names for their applications <a href="https://srcco.de/posts/naming-applications-components-microservices.html#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>.
I see many tech companies using codenames for internal applications and microservices.
For example, Airbnb goes bananas with "Banana":</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/spikebrehm/status/1100566261191258114"><img alt="Years ago there started a trend at @AirbnbEng to come up with clever cheeky names for services. Now it's gotten out of control. Exhibit A: the internal web app for viewing microservice docs is called &quot;Banana&quot;. 🍌  What does it mean??" src="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/twitter-airbnb-banana.png"></a></p><p>Twitter engineers seem to like bird names (no surprise):</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1100624311872679938"><img alt="We did this at Twitter. It got to the point where I had no idea what people were talking about anymore. Hummingbird, dodo, snowflake, Parrott, we're all real system names" src="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/twitter-twitter-names.png"></a></p><p>Spotify seems to have a mixture of codenames ("Bieber", "horus", "hotdog") and meaningful system names ("charts-api", "userdata").
Slide from a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/kevingoldsmith/how-spotify-builds-products-organization-architecture-autonomy-accountability/112">talk given by the CTO in 2016</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/spotify-system-names.jpg"><img alt="Spotify system names" src="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/spotify-system-names.jpg"></a></p><p>The Rockefeller Archive Center <a href="https://blog.rockarch.org/project-electron-update-building-microservices-for-integration">uses constellation-themed names for microservices</a> ("aquarius", "fornax", "gemini"):</p>
<p><a href="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/rockarch-microservices-overhead.png"><img alt="Rockefeller Archive Center microservices" src="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/rockarch-microservices-overhead.png"></a></p><p>Zalando also started to use "fun" team and application IDs when introducing microservices in 2015.
Teams started to have naming schemes for their applications, e.g. "coastal shapes" or "characters from Agatha Christie's Poirot".
Some Georgian names turned out to be successful Open Source projects:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/try_except_/status/1266108151646035969"><img alt="Twitter: Our Georgian heritage at @ZalandoTech" src="https://srcco.de/galleries/naming-applications-components/twitter-zalando-georgian-names.png"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1942384">orange site has more suggestions for ridiculous names</a>
and <a href="https://namingschemes.com/">namingschemes.com</a> can be your inspiration, too.
So if you want to go crazy with naming, by all means do, but please consider the consequences.
<a href="https://theiconic.tech/naming-your-microservices-needs-to-be-trivial-not-cryptic-288902e800e1">Naming your microservices needs to be trivial, not cryptic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
How does this sound? I deployed “Leonardo” and it broke “Ernest”</blockquote>
<p>VS</p>
<blockquote>
I deployed “shipments” and that caused the outage on “pick and pack” too.</blockquote>
<p>Or do you want your meetings to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ">sound like this</a>?</p>
<div id="guidelines">
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>If random "fun" names are not the way to go, how to name internal applications, components, and microservices?
Here some proposed guidelines.</p>
<p>Application names…</p>
<ul>
<li>… MUST NOT contain offensive terms</li>
<li>… MUST NOT include organization/team identifiers</li>
<li>… SHOULD describe the application's purpose</li>
<li>… SHOULD NOT consist solely of acronyms</li>
<li>… SHOULD NOT use broad/general names for local purposes</li>
<li>… SHOULD NOT be clever or rely on temporary concepts</li>
<li>… CAN represent a product branding (if established)</li>
</ul>
<div id="names-must-not-contain-offensive-terms">
<h3>Names MUST NOT contain offensive terms</h3>
<p>Avoid offensive words like "blacklist", "master", and "slave". Avoid violent names like "kill", "killer", and "war".
Also avoid political terms like "brexit" and "putin". Avoid names which can sound offensive for your colleagues,
e.g. "Den Den Mushi" are <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Den_Den_Mushi">fictional snails</a>, but "Mushi" sounds a lot like "Muschi" (pussy) in German.
Other terminology can also be problematic. For example, imagine you work in a telecommunication company and name one of your services "big brother"
— guess what happens if this name is leaked to the press?</p>
</div>
<div id="names-must-not-include-organization-team-identifiers">
<h3>Names MUST NOT include organization/team identifiers</h3>
<p>Applications typically outlive their organization structure.
Adding department/team identifiers to your application names will cause confusion and unnecessary renaming.
This is especially problematic if your org/team names are codenames.
For example, team "kingpins" has created an application "kingpins-user-frontend", what happens if the application is handed over to team "gravity"?</p>
<p>Microservices should be owned by exactly one engineering team, but they should not reflect the team's identity.</p>
</div>
<div id="names-should-describe-the-application-s-purpose">
<h3>Names SHOULD describe the application's purpose</h3>
<p>The application's name should describe its business purpose, i.e. why it exists in the first place.
The application's purpose should not change, otherwise we need to introduce a new application with a different name.
A microservice should have one responsibility. This should be reflected in its name.</p>
<p>Don't assume that others will have the same context as you and understand the name's meaning.
Make sure to ask colleagues who are not familiar with your business domain to review your names.</p>
</div>
<div id="names-should-not-consist-solely-of-acronyms">
<h3>Names SHOULD NOT consist solely of acronyms</h3>
<p>Acronyms are sometimes a necessary evil, but avoid acronyms unless they are well established in your company.
"CMS" (Content Management System) is a well established acronym. CLOTS, BUGR, and NIPL are probably not well-known.
Avoid cryptic acronyms.</p>
</div>
<div id="names-should-not-use-broad-general-names-for-local-purposes">
<h3>Names SHOULD NOT use broad/general names for local purposes</h3>
<p>Large organizations tend to use similar entities in different domains, e.g. there is probably more than one "item", "order", and "user" entity in your company.
Avoid using too general names like "item processor" or "user service" unless you are absolutely sure that your organization only has exactly one definition for "item" and "user".</p>
</div>
<div id="names-should-not-be-clever-or-rely-on-temporary-concepts">
<h3>Names SHOULD NOT be clever or rely on temporary concepts</h3>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with <a href="https://www.namingthings.co/naming-things-principles">Austerity as a naming principle</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
It can be tempting to use a bit of humor or a cultural reference in code to lighten the mood a bit, but doing this can violate many principles. For example, a joke name can reduce understandability of the underlying concept and reduce the name’s consistency and searchability. Colloquialisms (which are only understandable to certain audiences) and puns can cause similar issues. They may seem fun initially, but after dealing with them for years, that fun will turn into apathy and (more likely!) antipathy. When in doubt, choose names that are literal and dry.</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="names-can-represent-a-product-branding">
<h3>Names CAN represent a product branding</h3>
<p>Internal application names should not be cryptic codenames, but establishing a brand sometimes makes sense.
Don't introduce a codename unless you are willing to invest into establishing a (product) brand, e.g. a well-recognized codename within the company or for promoting an Open Source project.
Spotify released their developer portal "Backstage" which is now a <a href="https://github.com/spotify/backstage">recognized OSS project</a>.
Zalando has well-established codenames for central infrastructure components like <a href="https://nakadi.io/">Nakadi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper">Skipper</a>.
Almost every Zalando engineer knows what Nakadi and Skipper are.</p>
<p>Your local "raccoon" and "wingman" microservices don't need branding, their codenames <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ">just lead to confusion</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Naming is hard, but there is no shortcut for finding a good name.
Selecting or inventing a naming scheme
and assigning a random name to each application sounds like fun.
Please don't prioritize this fun over the struggle of all your colleagues having to deal with these "fun" names.
Involve colleagues from other departments to find a "good" name which expresses the application's purpose.</p>
<p>Stop proliferating meaningless "fun" codenames for software systems.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and grew up during the dot com boom in the late 1990s. One of the most interesting things in looking back are the stark differences in what it took to be successful back then with a software company and what it takes to be successful in building a software startup today in the US. </p>

<p>When I was a teenager, if you wanted to get into internet startups, you needed to find information on how to build websites. Although there were some no-code website builders, they were largely terrible. Building websites from scratch was the way to go. Moreover, developer knowledge was not really available online, because content on the internet was still being written. You had to hop over to your local Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore to buy books on HTML, Javascript, Perl and whatnot. Lastly and most importantly, you needed access to servers. It was not uncommon for internet companies to spend boatloads of money setting up their infrastructure in a closet at their office. Back then, technical knowledge was a really valuable and a limited skill. If you could assemble the best technical teams and keep them happy, that was a really strong moat for you because you could prevent other would-be competitors from being able to build a competing offer.</p>

<p>And as a result, for many years, there were not that many websites in the US market (or anywhere). If you had a website, it was relatively easy to capture attention and web traffic. One such website, Craigslist, a simple peer-to-peer marketplace site that we are all familiar with, was started in 1995 and continues to reign to this day despite so many upstarts trying to compete with it on better design and usability. Why? Craigslist gets the job done and more importantly, people know about its existence. Distribution is king.</p>



<p>Although it often took months to build out a website in the 90s, today you can often get a fairly straightforward site out the door even with no-code tools in less than a day. And if you do need to write code, you can search for code examples on just about every possible topic in a variety of discussion forums and on YouTube. Even more advanced computer science topics such as in machine learning now have so many open source resources and infrastructure.  You can often use a variety of specialty libraries without having specialized knowledge. For the most part, in software, technical information has largely become commoditized. This isn’t to say that you can’t make good money being a software engineer — and in fact, if you are a top engineer, you can now make a boatload of money! But it’s to say that most “run-of-the-mill” software development is not a unique skillset and most software businesses developed today don’t require specialized software development skills.</p>



<p>This has led to a flurry of many applications being built online – often with multiple teams building the same thing. It is not uncommon to run into 50 different founding teams all trying to build a marketplace for gym trainers. Or 300 founding teams trying re-invent marketing automation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/19058/how-many-websites-are-there/">Statista</a>, the number of websites has ballooned to nearly 2B!</p>



<p>For most software businesses in the US, the problem isn’t technical knowledge anymore. The problem is getting a wedge into distribution — also known as marketing. </p>



<p>Furthermore, incumbents who generally do a good job, often manage to continue reigning. According to Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, who recently did a podcast on <em><a href="http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/">Invest Like The Best</a></em>, large tech companies have managed to take even more market share than 10 years ago. Some people may argue this is because the large tech companies have improved their products over time to stay ahead due to their increased collection of data and better algorithms that feed on that data over time. That may be true for some companies but not all. This also applies to other products that have not made significant strides in their technology — Craigslist, Salesforce CRM, Turbotax, Quickbooks to name a few. Even Google Search which arguably had a better product in the 1990s compared to its peers is about on par with alternative search engines today, but 90% of people worldwide still use Google. Old habits die hard, and distribution matters more than ever if you are just starting a business. It’s hard to topple incumbents who have strong distribution and already large audiences — even if you can build a much better product. </p>



<p>So where are the opportunities in software? Is it even possible to build a company that takes an entire market?  I took to Twitter to find out. </p>

<p>A big warm thanks to everyone who participated. A number of people came up with some great suggestions of winner-take-all companies within a variety of developer tools / API markets, but in large part, this was an incredibly difficult challenge. No one could think of a company that has started in the last decade and has clearly dominated above all other competitors. On the flipside, we’ve already rattled off a number of older software companies that continue to dominate market share TO THIS DAY in a variety of areas: Google Search, Amazon Books, Turbotax, etc. This isn’t to say that you cannot build a big business if you don’t own a market, but it’s to say that the old way of thinking about market domination is just not applicable anymore.</p>



<p>Put another way, a lot of the “low hanging fruit” in the US software market is now gone. Software in the US generally works. And new opportunities get swept up with would-be competitors immediately. If the 90s was about thinking through your build, the 2020s is about thinking through marketing &amp; distribution. </p>



<p>As such, while many VCs are still fixated on finding unique technology in software and chasing companies that will ultimately be the sole winner, I’d contend that these two strategies — while successful in the 90s and early 00s — largely no longer work. There are certainly exceptions but if we are talking strictly about software, (not hardware, not drug discovery, not synthetic bio, etc) you’d be hard pressed to find a company where winning does not require a solid marketing and/or sales game. This is very different from the 1990s. Having a marketing skillset and mindset is what you need to win in 2020 in the US software market. </p>



<p>Although the low hanging fruit opportunities in the US are gone, it’s not to say that you can’t build a Salesforce competitor or a Craigslist competitor and be successful. The software market in the US has gotten so big — you can still build a billion dollar business if you are the 15th email service provider. We are seeing more and more unicorns ($1b valuation businesses) and many in the same market. However, we are also seeing many more startups than in the 1990s being built. This means that while there are more unicorns as an aggregate number, there are also many more companies that will not become unicorns. And with increased competition, even if there are more winners, the cost of customer acquisition becomes more expensive for all. </p>

<p>In fact, there are economic schools of thought around where we are in the tech-economic landscape. As economist Carlotta Perez describes, we are now in the <a href="http://www.carlotaperez.org/downloads/media/PEREZTechnologyandbubblesforEngelsbergseminar.pdf">Deployment Phase</a> of the internet in the US — meaning, we are in-process of exhausting all use cases for internet technologies in the US. What has traditionally happened at the end of a technology phase is oversaturation of investment dollars chasing smaller returns. Valuations go up, returns go down, and investors lose their money. (Sound familiar?) On a company level, what this means is, if not careful, a lot of companies will end up wasting marketing dollars in this type of landscape. Companies in the 2020s, unlike in the 1990s, need to really be performance-marketing driven in order to compete. The end of last year certainly showed us many examples of well-funded companies that could not make the unit economics work. The software industry has become a marketing game. </p>



<p>Even if you aren’t running a strictly software business but use software platforms to operate a business, marketing is still key. If you run your company off  Yelp, Shopify, Patreon, Stripe, Recurly, ConvertKit, Substack, or any of the others, you need to stand out, and that’s marketing. And the people who do the best at marketing make a LOT of money, and those who don’t, just can’t catch a break, even if they are good at their craft. Marketing is necessary.</p>



<p>There are, of course, exceptions to this — there are still emerging markets (both in the geographical sense and technology sense) where marketing doesn’t matter as much. </p>



<p>In developing geographical markets, it’s largely greenfield. We have a portfolio company in Indonesia that was able to get 250k signups almost immediately from brick and mortar small businesses and no budget. In the US, without a large marketing budget, this would be challenging to do now. Why? Because every Square and Opentable is knocking on their door and has been for years. There’s just so much noise small businesses tend to ignore. But in Indonesia, that isn’t the case…yet. The software landscape there is similar to the 1990s in the US. It’s harder to piggyback off of existing software infrastructure — whether it’s payments or platforms — but there’s also a lot of obvious opportunity in software that no one is going after. The same could be said about investing elsewhere in Southeast Asia or in LatAm or Africa. There are fewer startups to compete with for attention, and it’s less of a marketing game than building a software company in the US. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2020-06-29 This blogpost was edited the day after it got posted. During my morning walk I realised that my code had a glaring bug in the statistics. I was reporting training set figures, not the validation set. I re-ran the system with the appropriate numbers and while the conclusions did not change, some of the figures/numbers did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I started in data, many years ago, people were actively working on heuristics. These are rules that could look at data and then make appropriate decisions. In schematics, this was the norm;</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/then.png" alt="Those were the days." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 1: Those were the days.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You had to understand the data to come up with these rules and this was very time consuming. But then machine learning changed everything. Instead of writing rules that fit a problem, we provide labels and have a machine figure out the rules instead.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/now.png" alt="The latest and greatest." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 2: The latest and greatest.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The latter approach has merit to it but it requires a new way of working. It also tends to be compute intensive because we’re interested in finding the best possible settings.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-3"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/alg.png" alt="All those settings." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 3: All those settings.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To find the best settings for all of these models we’ve even got gridsearch via cross validation; an industry standard to make sure that we pick the best model.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-4"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/settings.png" alt="All this expensive compute better be worth it." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 4: All this expensive compute better be worth it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there’s merit to the methodology. We want to demonstrate consistent results in our models. But we’re representing <strong>all the possible properties of a model</strong> as a single number. That’s a massive reduction of information, and frankly, an overly simplified way to think about models.</p>
<h2 id="dangerzone">Dangerzone</h2>
<p>I’ve written before that “GridSearch is not Enough[tm]” but in this document I wanted to give an example of how the technique can also be a problem. GridSearch is insufficient at best, it can also be dangerous at worst.</p>

<p>The main reason is that I’ve seen people put blind faith into the methodology causing a blind spot for other issues with the model. I’ve also spoken to data scientists who think that machine learning algorithms are unbiased tools that find the “truth” in the data and that grid search is a methodological purity. This is a dangerous attitude so I figured I’d create a counter-example.</p>
<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>
<p>So let’s do a small experiment. The goal is to see the effect of machine learning on a biased dataset. Given a biased dataset, will grid search amplify the bias in the dataset or reduce it?</p>
<p>I’ve draw a dataset using <a href="https://drawdata.xyz/">drawdata.xyz</a>. Let’s pretend that this usecase represents predicting salaries based on skill level. The skill level is plotted on the x-axis and the salary/reward is plotted on the y-axis. There’s two groups of datapoints and one represents a marginalized group. This group is under represented, only appears with low salaries and it also has a lower salary than it’s non-marginalised peers. The current illustration is a blunt representation of what might happen in a real life dataset (the bias can be more subtle) but the question is; what pattern will be picked up after grid search?</p>

<p>Below we’ll have a look at the results of three different models. We’ll also list the mean squared error that was reported back to us from the gridsearch.</p>

Figure 7: Mean Squared Error, Train: 993.57 Test: 1343.09
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice how the model that has the lowest mean squared error is also the model that causes the most bias between groups for higher skill levels. This increase in bias <em>cannot</em> be blamed merely on the data. It’s the choice of the model that increases this bias which is the responsibility of the algorithm designer.</p>
<p>Now, you could argue that this is a theoretical dataset. No professional would include something like gender into a model predicting salary. <a href="https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/issues/7">Right?</a> We can repeat the same exercise with something that correlates with a sensitive attribute instead but you can expect similar result. You can get a smaller mean squared error when you can learn the bias in the dataset. No matter how subtle.</p>
<p>This is what I find scary about gridsearch. People have been learned to trust it even though it can pick a model you should not consider. Notice how the grid search would tell us that there <em>should</em> be a big payment gap between the two groups even if they display high levels of skill. In algorithmic terms some might call this behavior “optimal” while in real life, you would call this sexism, ageism or racism.</p>

Figure 8: Mean Squared Terror: over 9000.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The thing to remember here is that 100% unbiased datasets don’t really exist. This phenomenon of overfitting on a metric is something that gridsearch contributes to. Combine that with algorithm designers who don’t have domain knowledge in the domain that they’re applying your algorithm to and you might just get this.</p>

<p>A bunch of people have been sending me links to a particularly sloppy article that (mis)uses linear regression to draw an incorrect conclusion from some data. So I guess I’ve got to got back to good-old linear regression, and talk about it a bit.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the basics. What is linear regression?</p>



<p>If you have a collection of data – typically data with one independent variable, and one dependent variable (that is, the first variable can vary any way it wants; changing it will change the second variable), then you’re probably interested in how the dependent variable relates to the independent. <em>If</em> you have reason to believe that they should have a linear relationship, then you’d like to know just what that linear relationship is.</p>



<p>If your data were perfect, then you’d just need to plot all of the data points on a graph, with the independent variable on the X axis, and the dependent on the Y, and then your graph would be a line, and you could get its slope and Y intercept, and thus completely capture the relationship.</p>



<p>But data is never perfect. There’s a lot of reasons for that, but no real set of collected data is ever perfect. No matter how perfect the real underlying linear relationship is, real measured data will always show some scatter. And that means that you can draw a lot of possible lines through the collected data. Which one of them represents the best fit?</p>



<p>Since that’s pretty abstract, I’m going to talk a bit about an example – the very example that was used to ignite my interest in math!</p>



<p>Back in 1974 or so, when I was a little kid in second grade, my father was working for RCA, as a physicist involved in manufacturing electronics for satellite systems. One of the important requirements for the products they were manufacturing was that they be <em>radiation hard</em> – meaning that they could be exposed to quite a bit of radiation before they would be damaged enough to stop working.</p>



<p>Their customers – NASA, JPL, and various groups from the U. S. Military, had very strong requirements. They had to show, for a manufacturing setup of a particular component, what the failure profile was.</p>



<p>The primary failure mode of these chips they were making was circuit trace failure. If a sufficiently energetic gamma ray hit one of the circuit traces, it was possible that the trace would burn out – breaking the circuit, and causing the chip to fail.</p>



<p>The test setup that that they used had a gamma ray emitter. So they’d make a manufacturing run to produce a batch of chips from the setup. Then they’d take those, and they’d expose them to increasing doses of radiation from the gamma emitter, and detect when they failed.</p>



<p>For trace failure, the probability of failure is linear in the size of the radiation dose that the chip is exposed to. So to satisfy the customer, they had to show them what the slope of the failure curve was. “Radiation hard” was defined as being able to sustain exposure to some dose of radiation with a specified probability of failure.</p>



<p>So, my dad had done a batch of tests, and he had a ton of little paper slips that described the test results, and he needed to computer the slop of that line – which would give the probability of failure as a multiple of the radiation dose.</p>



<p>I walked into the dining room, where he was set up doing this, and asked what he was doing. So he explained it to me. A lot like I just explained above – except that my dad was a much better teacher than me. I couldn’t explain this to a second or third grader the way that he did!</p>



<p>Anyway… The method that we use to compute the best line is called <em>least squares</em>. The intuition behind it is that you’re trying to find the line where the average distance of all of the datapoints from that line is the smallest. But a simple average doesn’t work well – because some of the data points are above the line, and some are below. Just because one point is, say, above a possible fit by 100, and another is below by 100 doesn’t mean that the two should cancel. So you take the distance between the data points and the line, and you square them – making them all positive. Then you find the line where that total is the smallest – and that’s the best fit.</p>



<p>So let’s look at a real-ish example.</p>



<p>For example, here’s a graph that I generated semi-randomly of data points. The distribution of the points isn’t really what you’d get from real observations, but it’s good enough for demonstration.<img src="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graph.png" alt="scatter plot of randomly skewed data" srcset="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graph.png 346w, http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graph-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px"></p>



<p>The way that we do that is: first we compute the means of <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x" alt="x"> and <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="y" alt="y">, which we’ll call <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\overline{x}" alt="\overline{x}"> and <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7By%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\overline{y}" alt="\overline{y}">. Then using those, we compute the slope as:</p>



<p><img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%20m%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CSigma_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%28y-%5Chat%7By%7D%29%7D%7B%5CSigma_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title=" m = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n (x-\hat{x})(y-\hat{y})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (x-\hat{x})^2}" alt=" m = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n (x-\hat{x})(y-\hat{y})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (x-\hat{x})^2}"></p>



<p>Then for the y intercept: <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=b%20%3D%20%5Chat%7By%7D%20-%20m%5Chat%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="b = \hat{y} - m\hat{x}" alt="b = \hat{y} - m\hat{x}">.</p>



<p>In the case of this data: I set up the script so that the slope would be about 2.2 +/- 0.5. The slope in the figure is 2.54, and the y-intercept is 18.4.</p>



<p>Now, we want to check how good the linear relationship is. There’s several different ways of doing that. The simplest is called the correlation coefficient, or <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="r" alt="r">.</p>



<p><img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%20r%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%5Cright%29%20%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28y%20-%20%5Chat%7By%7D%29%5Cright%29%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%20%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%5E2%5Cright%29%20%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28y%20-%20%5Chat%7By%7D%29%5E2%5Cright%29%20%7D%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title=" r = \frac{\left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})\right)}{\sqrt{ \left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})^2\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})^2\right) }}" alt=" r = \frac{\left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})\right)}{\sqrt{ \left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})^2\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})^2\right) }}"></p>



<p>If you look at this, it’s really a check of how well the variation between the measured values and the expected values (according to the regression) match. On the top, you’ve got a set of products; on the bottom, you’ve got the square root of the same thing squared. The bottom is, essentially, just stripping the signs away. The end result is that if the correlation is perfect – that is, if the dependent variable increases linearly with the independent, then the correlation will be 1. If the dependency variable decreases linearly in opposition to the dependent, then the correlation will be -1. If there’s no relationship, then the correlation will be 0.</p>



<p>For this particular set of data, I generated it with a linear equation with a little bit of random noise. The correlation coefficient is slighly greater than 0.95, which is exctly what you’d expect.</p>



<p>Ok, so that’s the basics of linear regression. Let’s get back to the bozo-brained article that started this.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EcCqXojUMAEBFnp.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>They featured this graph:</p>



<p>You can see the scatter-plot of the points, and you can see the line that was fit to the points by linear regression. How does that fit look to you? I don’t have access to the original dataset, so I can’t check it, but I’m guessing that the correlation there is somewhere around 0.1 or 0.2 – also known as “no correlation”.</p>



<p>You see, the author fell into one of the classic traps of linear regression. Look back at the top of this article, where I started explaining it. I said that <em>if</em> you had reason to believe in a linear relationship, then you could try to find it. That’s the huge catch to linear regression: no matter what data you put in, you’ll always get a “best match” line out. If the dependent and independent variables don’t have a linear relation – or don’t have any actual relation at all – then the “best match” fit that you get back as a result is garbage.</p>



<p>That’s what the graph above shows: you’ve got a collection of data points that to all appearances has no linear relationship – and probably no direct relationship at all. The author is interpreting the fact that linear regression gave him an answer with a positive slope as if that positive slope is meaningful. But it’s only meaningful <em>if</em> there’s actually a relationship present.</p>



<p>But when you look at the data, you don’t see a linear relationship. You see what looks like a pretty random scatterplot. Without knowing the correlation coefficient, we don’t know for sure, but that line doesn’t look to me like a particularly good fit. And since the author doesn’t give us any evidence beyond the existence of that line to believe in the relationship that they’re arguing for, we really have no reason to believe them. All they’ve done is demonstrate that they don’t understand the math that they’re using.</p>

How to create an interactive outline map with React of the city of Munich
I want to show in this article.</p><p>The great project <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreeMap</a> offers a query tool to obtain
city outlines of boroughs in many formats. This query tool is called
<a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/">Overpass Turbo</a>.</p><p>With the following query you get the administrative boundaries of the
city, which in the case of Munich are its boroughs.</p><div data-language="text"><pre><code>[out:json][timeout:300];

{{geocodeArea:München}}-&gt;.searchArea;

(
  relation["boundary"="administrative"]["admin_level"="9"](area.searchArea);
);

out body;
&gt;;
out skel qt;</code></pre></div><p>Press the “Run” button and then “Export” and download it as GPX.</p><p>For our purpose we need the outline information in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
format.
There is an open source Python script that converts any GPX file to SVG.
It is called <a href="https://nasauber.de/opensource/gpx2svg">gpx2svg</a>.</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>python3 gpx2svg -i export.gpx -o export.svg</code></pre></div><p>Now can you edit the SVG file in Adobe Illustrator.
Export the file again as an SVG to make it responsive and suitable
for further processing, with the following options:</p><p>Other SVG programs like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> might also work, although
I have not tried them here.</p><p>Now you can paste the SVG inline into your React component.
For interactivity when the mouse moves over a borough you need to
add a mouseover listener. Also, a name attribute is added to
identify the name of the borough to each SVG path.
The style attribute is removed.</p><p>In this React component I have defined a callback property
that gets called whenever you hover the mouse over a borough.
The parameter is the name of the borough which then gets
displayed in the parent component.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<p>I am skeptical of those who predict the future by looking at the past. It’s not that history follows a random walk, like the stock market. Quite the contrary—it is easy to show certain patterns in history. But predicting how and when those patterns will yield any particular result in any given society seems like astrology. Peter Turchin, however, offers a very convincing, and very well-supported, tying of patterns to data. I’m still not sure it’s not astrology, but I’m half convinced. And this is a good book to read in January 2020—because right now is when Turchin predicts, in America, the swelling discord of the title.</p>
<p>This book is, fortunately, nothing like the terrible <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Fourth Turning (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2019/01/22/book-review-the-fourth-turning/" target="_blank">The Fourth Turning</a></em>, a more famous and very stupid book. Like that book, however, it does posit cycles in societies (as do many other books, ranging from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ibn Khaldun’s Muqaddimah (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2019/08/09/ibn-khaldun-an-intellectual-biography-robert-irwin/" target="_blank">Ibn Khaldun’s </a><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ibn Khaldun’s Muqaddimah (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2019/08/09/ibn-khaldun-an-intellectual-biography-robert-irwin/" target="_blank">Muqaddimah</a> </em>to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Joseph Tainter’s The Collapse of Complex Societies (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2018/01/24/book-review-the-collapse-of-complex-societies-joseph-a-tainter/" target="_blank">Joseph Tainter’s </a><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Joseph Tainter’s The Collapse of Complex Societies (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2018/01/24/book-review-the-collapse-of-complex-societies-joseph-a-tainter/" target="_blank">The Collapse of Complex Societies</a></em>). “[A] typical historical state goes through a sequence of relatively stable political regimes separated by unstable periods characterized by recurrent waves of internal war. The characteristic length of both stable (or integrative) and unstable (or disintegrative) phases is a century or longer, and the overall period of the cycle is around two to three centuries.” Among many other examples Turchin gives, <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2016/10/11/book-review-considerations-on-the-causes-of-the-greatness-of-the-romans-and-their-decline-montesquieu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the integrative phase of the Roman Republic (opens in a new tab)">the integrative phase of the Roman Republic</a> was 350–130 BC; its disintegrative phase was 130–30 BC, to be succeeded by Principate Rome. To take a less commonly known example, the integrative phase of Valois France was AD 1450–1560; its disintegrative phase was AD 1560–1660. Turchin sees America as being in a disintegrative phase that began in the 1970s and will peak starting in 2020. <em>Ages of Discord</em> is an attempt to substantiate that claim, and offers predictions of chaos in America’s near future. Like Hari Seldon in Isaac Asimov’s <em>Foundation</em>, Turchin sees this disintegrative phase as inevitable—but also, maybe, ameliorable.</p>
<p><span><span><a target="_blank" title="Print" rel="noopener" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ages-of-Discord-Turchin-PDF.pdf"><span>Print (PDF)</span></a></span></span></p><p>Since this is the turn of the decade, we have, over the past few weeks, been subjected to endless news articles claiming that the 2010s were the best decade ever. Turchin is having none of that. (And all those claims are stupid on their face—their sole substantive “argument” is that due to the spread of free markets, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="poverty in the Third World (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2015/08/11/book-review-the-white-mans-burden-why-the-wests-efforts-to-aid-the-rest-have-done-so-much-ill-and-so-little-good-william-easterly/" target="_blank">poverty in the Third World</a> has declined sharply—which is true enough, but totally irrelevant to whether America had a good decade, or is going to have one over the next ten years). The method of <em>Ages of Discord </em>(which, interestingly, <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2019/06/19/the-war-on-normal-people-the-truth-about-americas-disappearing-jobs-and-why-universal-basic-income-is-our-future-andrew-yang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="is given substantial attention in Presidential candidate Andrew Yang's recent book (opens in a new tab)">is given substantial attention in Presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s recent book</a>) is to use an enormous amount of data and mathematical modeling to add substance to Turchin’s theory of “secular cycles,” developed in an earlier book of that name by Turchin and Sergey Nefedov (where secular has its economic meaning of “a long-term trend of indefinite specific duration”). Turchin calls this the science of “cliodynamics,” a neologism formed from the name of the muse of history and the term for the science of why things change (and also reflecting that society is a web, a “dynamical system”). Cliodynamics is an attempt to view history through science, primarily through the science of statistics. It seeks to offer general principles that can be tested against historical data, and that testing is what Turchin offers here.</p>
<p>Turchin begins with the observation that, however it may feel to us, human societies are fragile. Somewhat melodramatically, he references the American Civil War, while unconvincingly disclaiming that he believes something like that is imminent. He <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="does not think that Steven Pinker is right (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2015/07/06/book-review-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-stephen-pinker/" target="_blank">does not think that Steven Pinker is right</a> that we are now more civilized than we used to be; for Turchin, there is no thing new under the Sun, except for, perhaps the science of cliodynamics. Turchin notes that in 2010 (this book was published in 2016) he predicted “the next decade is likely to be a period of growing instability in the United States and <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2017/09/08/book-review-the-strange-death-of-europe-douglas-murray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="western Europe (opens in a new tab)">western Europe</a>.” He is well-satisfied that he was right, and I think most people would agree.</p>
<p>The framework of Turchin’s model, laid out in Part I, is the “Structural-Demographic Theory,” originated by Jack Goldstone to apply to agrarian societies and reformulated by Turchin and Nefedov in their earlier book to apply to industrial societies. SDT consists of three basic claims, or “principles.” First, population growth exceeding productivity (the Malthusian Trap, in essence) leads to falling wages, migration, and ultimately, wage protests such as riots. Actual starvation due to the Malthusian Trap is no longer a problem in industrial societies, of course—population increases rather lead to declining real wages, with similar negative effects on the wellbeing of the masses, “immiseration” (though the mechanics are more complex than in agrarian societies). This is the “labor oversupply principle.” Second, fast population growth also leads to “elite overproduction,” where elites compete for a largely fixed number of elite positions, which leads to elite disunity, the creation of a counter-elite, and elite conflict. This problem is worse in industrial societies, since unlike in agrarian societies, declining real wages actually benefit the elite, who get cheaper labor, and respond by engaging in ever greater, “runaway” consumption, exacerbating the intraelite conflict caused by their swelling ranks. This is the “elite overproduction principle.” And third, the “instability principle,” where population growth also leads to expansion of the state, resulting in increased taxes, which inevitably fail to cover expenses, leading to fiscal crisis. “As all these trends intensify, the end result is state bankruptcy and consequent loss of military control; elite movements of regional and national rebellion; and a combination of elite-mobilized and popular uprisings that expose the breakdown of central authority.” This drives the disintegrative phase of the secular cycle, involving increased mortality, decreased productivity, instability, political violence, war, and, potentially, collapse—followed, ultimately, by a new integrative phase, sometimes with a very different society, sometimes with much the same society, where the three principles reverse in unison.</p>
<p>Turchin is not claiming specific causation. He is showing correlations. He troubles himself to clarify that these three principles are simply proxies “for the movements of structural forces postulated by the theory. In other words, the Structural-Demographic Theory provides a holistic explanation not only for these three particular variables, but for a host of others.” Occasionally he will suggest possible causal links, the most notable being that elites, exhausted after a long period of instability (often including the death of many members of the elite), turn away from competition to cooperation, helping to end a disintegrative phase. (The <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2018/08/03/book-review-storm-storm-beginning-end-roman-republic-mike-duncan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="end of the Roman Republic (opens in a new tab)">end of the Roman Republic</a> is the classic example.) Mostly, though, it is patterns tied to data that he offers, and often patterns within patterns.</p>
<p>Thus, his project is to develop mathematical models, then feed them historical data from different eras and see what comes out. This book is specifically written to apply such a model to the United States from its formation (roughly 1780) to the present (2016). It is not an easy read. Lengthy entire chapters are taken up with mathematical formulas—Turchin says the reader can skip these, but that undermines understanding, so I recommend against skipping. The point of the mathematics is to quantify and weight factors in a model that can be applied across different times and places, as well as perform various transforms and shifts, all of which Turchin explains (and he apparently offers most of his data and models for others to review). Complexities abound—for example, finding quantitative proxies for cultural mood, or for the willingness of elites to cooperate with each other, rather than engage in conflict. Much else goes into this, such as rejecting the idea of discrete generations, and instead modeling transmission of behavior across time, paying attention to the “fathers-and-sons dynamic,” feedback loops, and the intersection of different resulting sub-cycles, which aggregate to show certain patterns. Any reader is going to wonder if Turchin is fitting the math to his theories, but looking around, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="nobody seems (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/12/book-review-secular-cycles/" target="_blank">nobody seems</a> to accuse him of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/02/book-review-ages-of-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="doing that (opens in a new tab)">doing that</a>. </p>
<p>After introducing the three principles of SDT as applied to industrial societies, and offering an explanation and justification of his mathematical approach, in Part II Turchin expands on each of the three principles as applied to America. In “Demography and Wellbeing,” Turchin examines statistics about and patterns in labor supply since 1780. He analyzes both immigration and native births, compared to real wages over time, both absolutely and relative to GDP per capita. He then ties the resulting graphs to measures of wellbeing, such as height of adults (which declined four centimeters from 1830 to 1900!), life expectancy, age of first marriage (which he notes is “only imperfectly correlated with social optimism”), and so forth.</p>
<p>Tellingly for modern debates, Turchin here draws the firm conclusion that when immigration is high, not only wages, but wellbeing, are low, and not just for a few years, but correlating over decades—including the most recent phase, since 1970, where wellbeing has objectively declined (contrary to the propaganda we are fed), while immigration has skyrocketed and real wages stagnated. He takes this as demonstrating the accuracy of the labor oversupply principle. As he goes along, Turchin is also combining the data, in the form of various graphs, that he discusses. So, for example, he shows that when you overlay a graph of mass wellbeing on a graph for elite overproduction, you see that since 1780 there is a precise inverse relationship between the two—just as the SDT predicts.</p>
<p>In “Elite Dynamics,” Turchin focuses on the ruling class, defined as …</p></div></div>

	<p>
		Back in August of 2019 I had a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/cr6x9a/contest_singalong_week_until_aug_25/">Sing-Along Week contest on RetroBattlestations</a>&nbsp;with the challenge of playing a MIDI file synchronized to a speech synthesizer singing the lyrics. In my stash of cards I found an MQX-32M MIDI card (Roland MPU-401 clone) which I wanted to use for converting MIDI signals to interface to an Apple II+ with an Echo II speech synthesizer, but ended up using a laptop with a USB MIDI interface. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/fz6is8/contest_pizza_week_through_april_19th/">Pizza Week contest</a>&nbsp;made me more interested in finding a 486 in a pizza box case and so my search began for a suitable case.</p>
	
	<p>
		Searching eBay wasn't easy because there's not really a good search term that would find the kind of case I wanted. I didn't bother trying to make a saved search since this project wasn't a high priority. Instead every once in a while something would inspire to go hit eBay and try some other search terms. A couple of weeks ago I spotted this 486 and made a guess of the size based on the size of the 5.25" bay. It's fairly slim, it has a riser card to turn the cards sideways and the case <em>is</em> shorter than an ISA card, but I don't feel like it's slim enough to call it a pizza box. It's close though!</p>
	
	<p>
		The motherboard is a <a href="https://stason.org/TULARC/pc/motherboards/T/TMC-RESEARCH-CORPORATION-486-PAT48PG4-VER-1-2A.html">TMC PAT48PG4</a> and it came with 32MB of RAM (technically 36MB, it had four 30 pin SIMMs in it too) and 4 cards: VGA, SoundBlaster, modem, and multi-function IO. The seller had tested it and was sold as non-working, won't POST, although he said the cards all worked. I mostly wanted it for the case so I wasn't concerned. Of course when I got it I had to see if the motherboard was really dead. It didn't work for me either but then I discovered if I hit the reset button it would give me some error beeps. I tried another power supply and it came up after hitting reset! It still doesn't cold boot when powered on, not sure if there's a bad cap or if the very slight battery damage (battery was removed before I got it) is preventing the reset line from being pulled after power on. Nonetheless it was working enough that I needed to explore its capabilities more.</p>
	
	<p>
		My ultimate goal is to get a <em>very recent</em>&nbsp;Linux distro and Python 3 installed to a "large" hard drive, but being that this is a 486 installing a current Linux distro isn't trivial. The only Linux distros that still support installing from floppy media are quite dated. Normally I would bypass a floppy install entirely and just boot an older computer via PXE and then install over the network. I thought I could <a href="https://ipxe.org/appnote/buildtargets">put iPXE on a floppy</a> and stick in an ISA NIC but iPXE just hangs without any error messages right after it's loaded from floppy.&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>
		The BIOS is ancient and struggles with handling the "large" hard drive I hooked up. The drive is 8.45GB and the BIOS can only see it as an 8.0GB drive. Enabling LBA in the BIOS causes the computer to hang during POST after it detects the drive. Win98 fdisk insists the drive is only 504MB. FreeDOS can't see the drive at all. I tried sticking in a NIC with XTIDE ROM on the socket and XTIDE also insists there's no drive connected.</p>
	
	<p>
		Since I wanted to see how Linux would detect the drive that meant I needed to find a way to boot Linux. After a bit of googling I discovered the <a href="http://tiny.wiki.kernel.org/">make tinyconfig option</a> which makes a very small (but useless) kernel, small enough to fit on a floppy. <a href="https://weeraman.com/building-a-tiny-linux-kernel-8c07579ae79d">I enabled a couple of other options</a>, found a small enough initramfs, and was able to get it to boot on the 486. And as expected Linux has no problem with seeing that the drive is connected and the drive's full capacity.</p>
	
	<p>
		Next step is to actually get Linux installed to the hard drive. I'd rather not roll my own distro but maybe I'll have to. Another possibility is to boot Linux from floppy and then download a kernel and initrd from a current distro and kexec over to it. But that feels to me like reinventing iPXE.</p>

<p>What are we trying to do?  Looking at symbols present in the Spotify binary, this is actually part of the G++ runtime; specifically, <code>std::ctype::do_tolower</code>:</p>
<pre>  1d6ff51:       48 8b 05 18 a8 12 02    mov    0x212a818(%rip),%rax        # 3e9a770 
  1d6ff58:       48 8b 40 70             mov    0x70(%rax),%rax
  1d6ff5c:       48 0f be cb             movsbq %bl,%rcx
=&gt;1d6ff60:       8a 1c 88                mov    (%rax,%rcx,4),%bl
  1d6ff63:       89 d8                   mov    %ebx,%eax
  1d6ff65:       5b                      pop    %rbx
  1d6ff66:       c3                      retq
</pre>
<p>That <code>rax</code> value looks suspicious, and we can see if we translate it to ASCII that it is the little-endian representation of the string “LC_MONETARY”.  We’re trying to reach 0x70 into a structure in %rax for a pointer value, but we’re getting a string instead.</p>
<p>It turns out that when libstdc++ is compiled on a glibc system, it will attempt to access the internal <code>__ctype_*</code> members in the <code>locale_t</code> of the current locale.  musl’s <code>locale_t</code> is not ABI-compatible with glibc’s.  In fact, it is only 48 bytes in length; 0x70 (or 112 bytes) is past the end of the locale object musl has provided it!</p>
<p>I implemented a <a href="https://code.foxkit.us/adelie/gcompat/-/commit/2eae317bd62a38645f35c46ca62cdde24ff718d8">stub locale module in gcompat</a>, and… it tried to exec <code>/proc/self/exe</code>, which broke under the gcompat loader.  This required me to write a patch <a href="https://code.foxkit.us/adelie/gcompat/-/commit/18a847c22a04de22cc9c431e87b63a0cfd5f1286">interposing the execv* functions</a> to catch this.  And suddenly…</p>

<p>I replaced libcef.so from the Spotify DEB package with a matched-version libcef.so from Spotify’s Open Source builds page.  This allowed me to have more debugging symbols, and generating a core dump revealed:</p>

<p>Looking at how <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/base/+/master/allocator/allocator_shim_default_dispatch_to_glibc.cc#60">the Chromium allocator works internally</a>, the issue is that <code>RTLD_NEXT</code> won’t work on libraries loaded before libcef.  And looking at the output of <code>ldd spotify</code> revealed both libm and libdl before libcef; musl always redirects these to libc for glibc ABI compatibility.</p>
<p>Using PatchELF to remove these two <code>DT_NEEDED</code>s from the binary yielded a surprising result…</p>

<p>It works!  All the features I tested work: Spotify Connect, which means I can control the laptop’s playback using the iOS and Apple Watch apps; radio playback; Bluetooth speaker support.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You will need to download the official Spotify 64-bit DEB.  I have not tested this on a 32-bit system yet, but I see no reason it won’t work.  Once you have the DEB, extract the data.tar.xz file somewhere.  Use PatchELF on the Spotify binary as so:</p>

<p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is one of the core technologies involved in making our internet work, allowing networks to communicate their routes among eachother. Understanding how this tool can be used to define the topology of a network will both give you a better understanding of how internetworking and allow you translate this robustness into your own network.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with the core concepts of BGP and have the proper vocabulary to communicate this to another network engineer. You will also be able to use a userland routing daemon, BIRD, to establish peering sessions and begin announcing routes.</p>
<p>I plan to achieve this using a virtualized docker playground which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ncatelli/bird_examples_docker.git">here</a>
. In order to complete this tutorial you will need to ensure you have docker and docker-compose installed.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup:</h3>
<p>To begin, you will need to clone the repo of the <a href="https://github.com/ncatelli/bird_examples_docker.git">bird_examples_docker</a> project.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ncatelli@ofet&gt; git clone https://github.com/ncatelli/bird_examples_docker.git
ncatelli@ofet&gt; cd bird_examples_docker
ncatelli@ofet&gt; docker-compose up -d
</code></pre></div><p>This should create three containers (peer1, peer2 and peer3), all of which have BIRD installed and have peering sessions established. Don’t worry if you don’t know what this means yet, we will cover it shortly after we have our BGP playground set up and ready to go.</p>
<h3 id="login-in-to-your-playground">Login in to your playground:</h3>
<p>We will start by connecting to peer1 and checking that everything was setup correctly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ncatelli@ofet&gt; docker-compose exec peer1 bash

</code></pre></div><p>If you see that peer2 and peer3 are “Established”, everything is working as expected and we are ready to go. Before we begin playing with this playground, I will provide a brief overview of how BGP works.</p>
<h3 id="bgp-overview">BGP Overview:</h3>
<h4 id="terminology">Terminology:</h4>
<p>Border Gateway Protocol (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol">BGP</a>) is an exterior gateway protocol that is used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems. An autonomous system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">AS</a>) is an organizational unit of routing prefixes and policies. These AS are identified by a unique 16-bit, and later 32-bit, autonomous system number (ASN). For example, Facebook’s ASN would be 32934 or as commonly presented AS32934. The power of BGP lies in its ability to communicate routing protocols and policies among tens of thousands of decentralized AS.</p>
<p>The internet, along with many other networks, is composed of many autonomous systems that communicate between each other. This communication is facilitated by a peering session, which allows two AS to exchange policies, routes and link status. All of this information is exchanged between two BGP daemons, which will be listening on TCP port 179.</p>
<p>While BGP is considered an exterior gateway protocol that is used for routing between large organizations on the internet, it can also be used within an AS to enable their network engineers to control the topology of their internal network. This is where the terms exterior BGP (eBGP) and interior BGP (iBGP) stem from. iBGP will be our focus for the rest of this tutorial. We will now start experimenting with these peering sessions using BIRD and its interactive command-line tool, birdc.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-bird">Introduction to BIRD:</h3>
<p>BIRD is a fully-functional routing daemon that supports many different routing protocols, including BGP. BIRD provides a simple configuration format and command line utility for interacting with sessions. BIRD also comes with built-in support for both IPv4 and IPv6 and the respective tools to work with both protocols.</p>
<h4 id="examining-sessions">Examining Sessions:</h4>
<p>Similiar to how we verified that our docker environment was provisioned properly, we can view running sessions by running:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@peer1:/# birdc show protocols
BIRD 1.6.6 ready.
name     proto    table    state  since       info
kernel1  Kernel   master   up     02:36:02    
device1  Device   master   up     02:36:02    
direct1  Direct   master   up     02:36:02    
peer2    BGP      master   up     02:36:07    Established   
peer3    BGP      master   up     02:36:06    Established         
</code></pre></div><p>This gives us a lot of information. However, let us focus on the last two entries, peer2 and peer3. We can see that they are both BGP protocols and that the info field is Established. Each of these entries correspond to a BGP session that peer1 has open with peer2 and peer3. To demonstrate the relationship of these values to our running sessions, let’s stop the bird service on peer2. In a new terminal window run the following to stop peer2, simulating a network failure.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ncatelli@ofet&gt; docker-compose stop peer2
Stopping bird_examples_peer2_1 ... <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@peer1:/# birdc show protocols

peer3    BGP      master   up     02:36:06    Established  
</code></pre></div><p>By restarting peer2, a BIRD should restart and subsequently the peering session should be reestablished.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ncatelli@ofet&gt; docker-compose start peer2
Starting peer2 ... <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@peer1:/# birdc show protocols

peer3    BGP      master   up     02:36:06    Established    
</code></pre></div><p>By stopping the bird daemon on peer2, we have made the TCP connection on port 179 close between peer1 and peer2. Doing this changes our peer session from Established to Connect. Established and Connect correspond to two of many BGP states, however for the sake of this tutorial we will focus only on Established and consider all other values as not-established. For those more curious, more information on session states can be found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol#Finite-state_machines">wikipedia article on BGP</a>.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-a-bgp-session">Configuring a BGP Session</h4>
<p>Although we now know how to check whether our session are up in our BGP playground, it’s also important to understand how these sessions were configured in the first place. For that, we need to dig into the bird configuration files. Let’s look at the configuration files under /etc/bird on peer1.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@peer1:~# cat /etc/bird/bird.conf
router id 10.0.0.10;

protocol kernel <span>{</span>
  metric 0;
  import none;
  learn;
  export all;
<span>}</span>

protocol device <span>{</span>
<span>}</span>

protocol direct <span>{</span>
<span>}</span>

protocol bgp peer2 <span>{</span>
  local as 64512;
  neighbor 10.0.0.11 as 64513;
  import all;
  export all;
<span>}</span>

protocol bgp peer3 <span>{</span>
  local as 64512;
  neighbor 10.0.100.11 as 64514;
  import all;
  export all;
</code></pre></div><p>We can see that the configuration required to establish these initial sessions is very minimal. Let’s dig deeper into what actually makes this work. For that, we will focus on one specific block. Our protocol bgp peer2 block:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">protocol bgp peer2 <span>{</span>
  local as 64512;
  neighbor 10.0.0.11 as 64513;
  import all;
  export none;
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Earlier in this tutorial, we discussed the difference between eBGP and iBGP and how large AS identify themselves with a unique ASN. However, a small section of the available ASN have been reserved for private iBGP use. This range is 64512 - 65534. Knowing this, we can see that we have allocated a ASN from the private range to our peer2. This <em>local as</em> statement refers to the ASN of your local machine. In this case, peer1 is assigned the ASN 64512.</p>
<p>Looking at the next statement, we can see a neighbor statement with both an IP and an additional AS. This IP corresponds to the host, or neighbor in BGP lingo, that we are attempting to establish a session with, while the AS 64513 corresponds to the AS we’ve assigned to the host, peer2. We can confirm this by looking at the configuration file on peer2.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@peer2:/# grep -A4 peer1 /etc/bird/bird.conf
protocol bgp peer1 <span>{</span>
  local as 64513;
  neighbor 10.0.0.10 as 64512;
  export none;
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It is these two directives in our protocol BGP blocks that handle the initial establishment of sessions.</p>
<p>While establishing and maintaining sessions is crucial to the operation of BGP, established sessions alone will not allow you to route any traffic. In the next section, we will explore some of the other elements of our configuration files and how we can use them to discover and announce routes between our nodes. Before we proceed with doing this. I’d like to review our current topology.</p>
<p>Currently we have three nodes in our network, peer1 (AS64512), peer2 (AS64513) and peer3 (AS64514). These are configured in the same broadcast domain however the peering is structured like peer3 &lt;-&gt; peer1 &lt;-&gt; peer2. This structure allows communication of routes from either peer2 or peer3 through our route server, peer1. Please keep this topology in mind as we proceed with the next step of this tutorial, advertising routes.</p>
<h3 id="advertising-routes-with-bgp">Advertising Routes with BGP:</h3>
<h4 id="kernel-protocol">Kernel Protocol:</h4>
<p>Before we begin announcing routes between bird daemons, we should first understand how BIRD communicates routes between the linux kernel and the BIRD daemon. This is where that kernel protocol block we saw earlier comes into play.</p>
<pre><code>protocol kernel {
  metric 0;
  learn;
  import none;
  export all; 
}
</code></pre><p>There are many options that can be specified in the kernel block, and more information on those can be found <a href="http://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&amp;f=bird-6.html#ss6.6">here</a>, however the bulk of what we want to do is defined by the import/export definitions.</p>
<pre><code>import none;
</code></pre><p>Tells BIRD to not read routes in from the kernel routing table into BIRD. We will be obtaining our routes via the direct protocol which we will configure shortly.</p>
<pre><code>export all;
</code></pre><p>Tells BIRD to export all routes learned by other announcements into the …</p></div></div>

July 6, 2020 | https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl&quot;" decoding="async" height="488" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv.jpg" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-320w.jpg 320w" width="600"></p><p>The design doc is <em>the place to write down the trade-offs</em> you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." decoding="async" height="333" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w" width="655"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p><p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p><p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code …</p></article></div></div>

		</div><p>As Poland prepares for <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-presidential-election-heads-to-second-round-andrzej-duda/">a tight runoff</a> in the country's presidential election, some Poles living abroad complain that their vote was not counted in the first round of the contest.</p>
<p>Due to a combination of the restricted timetable for the election, following the chaotic postponement of a May 10 poll, and coronavirus restrictions in the countries where foreign voters were trying to cast their ballots, many fear the same will happen in the crucial second round.</p>
<p>Incumbent President <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-presidential-election-heads-to-second-round-andrzej-duda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrzej Duda won 43.5 percent of the vote on Sunday</a>, while liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, representing the Civic Platform opposition party, secured 30.46 percent of the vote. If Duda loses in the second round, it will hamper the ruling Law and Justice Party's ability to enact its nationalist platform because the president has the power to veto legislation.</p>
<p>After the May poll was canceled, the new election date was announced by the government <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-sets-a-new-presidential-election-date/">on June 3</a>, giving embassies and consulates around the world less than a month to prepare postal ballots. In several countries, including the U.S., the U.K., and Belgium, the entire vote had to be organized by mail.</p>
<p>That resulted in a series of problems with ballots sent too late; others were not stamped and so invalid; and others never reached their intended recipients.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I don’t really know what I can expect from the second round, but my experience with the first round is not making me optimistic” <em>— Alicja Małek, an artist and architect from Amsterdam</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>In several countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and the United Arab Emirates, the local authorities did not allow voting at all due to the coronavirus risks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alicja Małek, a 28-year-old artist and architect from Amsterdam, received her ballot paper last Monday. She posted it back using tracked mail to the consulate in The Hague on Tuesday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The letter hasn’t arrived, with no indication when it will arrive,” she said, meaning that her vote was not counted in the first round. She said that many of her friends are in a similar situation, with several not having received their ballot papers at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I don’t really know what I can expect from the second round, but my experience with the first round is not making me optimistic,” Małek added.</span></p>
<h3>Disappearing ballots</h3>
<p><span>The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an intergovernmental watchdog that monitors the election worldwide, said on Monday that the speed of the election created “legal uncertainty."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The legislation that enabled the election to take place was adopted in haste and without adequate public debate, at odds with the commitments made by all countries of the OSCE region,” it added in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span>The ODIHR stressed they don’t have a mandate to monitor how the vote was carried out abroad but also said they'd raised the issue with Polish officials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There will also be a second round of elections, and should there be any problems, it should be possible to rectify things with this regard,” said </span><span>Thomas Boserup, head of ODIHR’s special election assessment mission.</span></p>
<p><span>The Political Accountability Foundation, an NGO which monitored the election in Poland, has registered 160 complaints from voters abroad since Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is a very short election cycle and consulates, despite doing their best effort, did not have enough time and manpower to properly prepare for the election, especially in the case of countries such as the U.K or Germany where postal voting was the only way of voting,” said Zosia Lutkiewicz, the NGO's vice president.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>She added that Poles are not used to voting by mail — around 4 percent of votes came to the consulates wrongly filed, according to <a href="https://wybory.gov.pl/prezydent20200628/en/wyniki/pl?fbclid=IwAR2FpWT0OJ71mRS2iYubntUbVFGy04AyUZQe1j3E2SLi5k90srpRp6pG31g" target="_blank">the official data</a>.</span></p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied that the short notice for the election had prevented people from voting, adding that there had been an "unprecedented operation" to make sure foreign voters could participate.</p>
<p><span>“We haven’t registered a big scale of problems linked to delivering the ballots on time, neither with sending the ballots back by the voters,” the spokesperson said in a statement. They noted that the percentage of returned ballots was higher than in previous years: 87 percent in the U.K., 83 percent in the U.S., 92 percent in Ireland and 79 percent in France. On average, 15 percent of ballots from registered voters were not returned.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><span><h3>Why you should not use your app state as a data cache</h3>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>As a front-end developer and what some call an "architect", I've worked in very big projects, so I spent lot of time of last years trying to achieve a fully modular system in which the different front-end teams could <strong>reuse elements across many applications</strong>.</p>
<p>For simple components this is a relativelly easy job, but, when the elements are connected to data origins or to a global state <em>(what I usually call a "module")</em>, then the thing changes, but why?...</p>
<p>In most cases, despite the fact of following recommended good practices and patterns <em>(very extended thanks to great tools and libraries like <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect">Reselect</a>, etc.)</em> the elements still were not 100% reusable. Some parts of its logic remained "coupled" to an upper level, which made almost impossible that ones could work without the others in a new and completely isolated environment.</p>
<h2>The causes</h2>
<p>I realized that usually it was due to the fact that these elements were <strong>delegating part of their responsibilities to another one</strong> without even realizing it. The other element normally is at charge of making a preliminary initialization, recovering certain data and setting it into the "state" <em>(a very usual example of this is the case where the user data are retrieved during the login phase, then saved into the state, and then accessed afterwards by a lot of elements which are presupposing that the data are always there, ready to be used)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.data-provider.org/docs/assets/schemas/wrong-state-usage.svg" alt="Wrong state usage"></p>
<p>Most of times this is made simply because we want to optimize, save resources avoiding multiple calls to the server and unnecessary extra computations, but, following this pattern, we are <strong>making our elements completely dependant</strong>. Those elements can not be instantiated without the other ones, and they probably will require an specific load order to work properly. Which is worse, the first element is probably preparing or formatting the data in an specific way to which the rest of elements can be highly coupled. These "hidden" dependencies can easily propagate by the entire system without having notice, and, if you are not very careful, all the system becomes an indivisible and "monolithic" great piece of software. You could end working in an scenario in which hundred of invisible dependencies make almost impossible to remove, modify, or replace some elements <em>(guess which ones)</em> without tons of pain, <strong>that is the time when you can rename your project to "Domino blocks play".</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of the matter, <strong>the problem is to use the global state as a cache for the data</strong>, and, as it is "global", an orchestrator is needed to be at charge about when to retrieve the data, when to invalidate caches and retrieve the data again, etc. If there is no a clear "orchestrator", we usually delegate this responsibilities to the element that seems to be the responsible one <em>(as in the login example)</em>, but, doing this, <strong>we are making dependant all the other elements needing some portion of the same data.</strong></p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>So, maybe the solution can be to <strong>make every single element responsible of requesting always the data it needs</strong> <em>(connecting always them to the providers they want to read)</em>, and doing it <strong>in the most granular way possible</strong>, requesting only the data they want, and in the format they expect <em>(using specific selectors)</em>. Then, those selectors could be reused across many elements requiring the same data.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.data-provider.org/docs/assets/schemas/data-provider-usage.svg" alt="Data Provider usage"></p>
<p>This solution simply is at charge of providing cache and memoization in order to <strong>avoid unnecesary resources comsumption</strong>, and to abstract the elements about the fact of from where are they reading the data. They don't need to know about the existance of an "API", or a "State", or "localStorage", or whatever. They simply need the data, it is the "data layer" which should be the one responsible of knowing about where the data are being retrieved or sended.</p>
<p>In this way, each element has <strong>well defined dependencies</strong>, and you can move them from one project to another <em>(or from one part of your project to another)</em> without problem. The data will be requested and processed only when necessary, and only once (until the data decides that one cache has to be cleaned, then all of the elements connected to that data are informed about, so they can request it again).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.data-provider.org/img/front-end-architecture.png"><img src="https://www.data-provider.org/docs/assets/schemas/data-provider-usage-architecture.jpg" alt="Data Provider usage example"></a></p>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>As a summary, main targets of this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate global state from data cache.</li>
<li>Force elements to always request for the data they need (but avoiding a negative performance impact due to usage of an internal cache).</li>
<li>Make dependencies with the data clearly identifiable and traceable.</li>
<li>Provide selectors allowing to combine data from different data origins or other selectors, keeping the same interface and principles.</li>
<li>Inform elements when the cache of a provider is invalidated, so impacted elements can request the data again.</li>
<li>Unify the interfaces of different data origins, in order to isolate the elements about the knowledge from where the data are being retrieved.</li>
<li>Provide simple methods to handle loading and error states.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that, <strong>if this library does not result useful, at least these principles do, because this is the really important part of the project, more than the code itself.</strong> At the end, all patterns described here can be implemented using combinations of other tools. This project simply tries to facilitate the process.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1707"><div><div><p>A good programmer or software developer should be learning programming concepts and not languages.</p><p>Knowing many programming languages is great. However, does this alone really make you a good programmer?</p><h3>Learning Languages</h3><p>There are so many programming languages out there from Python to C++ to Rust to Go, and many many more.</p><p>Knowing different programming languages and understanding their details and quirks is great.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  The more you can learn about the tools you use everyday the better.</p><p>Over the years I've used many different languages ranging from low level languages like C++, to higher level languages like Ruby.</p><p>These days, I program a lot in python and javascript, and I love experimenting with new language features and discovering cool new code snippets.</p><p>However, I realize that simply knowing these languages doesn't make me a good programmer and doesn't say a lot about my skill set.</p><h3>Learn Concepts Not Languages</h3><p>The important thing is not just to learn a language itself.  We need to remember that programming languages are tools, and many of these tools change, evolve, and sometimes even become irrelevant. The moral of the story is that you shouldn't become dependent on a certain language.</p><p>You should learn how to use a language to solve a problem. And when you do that, you will inveitably pick up new concepts.</p><p>Let's use Python as an example. You don't want to just "learn python".  You want to, for example, learn how to use python to scrape data from a website. And by doing this, you will learn a ton of new and interesting concepts like how to make http requests, how to select html elements from the dom using xpaths and css selectors, among many other concepts.</p><p>We want to learn concepts, not just languages.</p><p>Here are some other examples:</p><ul><li>Maybe you want to learn how to use C++ to build a game and learn about the inner workings of computer graphics.</li><li>Maybe you want to learn how to use SQL to design efficient tables and optomize database queries.</li><li>Maybe you want to use Javascript with Vue.js or React to learn how to create reactive web pages.</li><li>Maybe you want to use Django to build a backend application and learn about how webservers handle incoming requests.</li></ul><h3>What Makes a Developer Valuable</h3><p>Knowing the languages and frameworks that a company or project uses is certainly a plus.</p><p>However, the true value that you'll bring to any project that you end up working on is your conceptual knowledge. Companies can find any number of applicants that have experience with their stack. But finding developers who have the deep experience and conceptual knowledge needed to use these tools to build well-designed software is much harder.</p><p>Good software developers are the people that focus on learning concepts and not just languages. Languages come and go, but the core fundamentals of computer science and programming do not.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this article.  If you did, here are some other interesting <a href="https://remotedevdaily.com/" title="interesting articles">interesting articles</a> for you to read.</p></div></div></article></div>]]>

It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land, or to what he can afford to take; <strong>but to what the farmer can afford to give.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In a Feudal Agrarian society, land is the major productive asset. So of course this conversation between Adam Smith and David Ricardo would be about Rent — what else would the average man spend his Wealth on?</p><p>But in 2018, we’ve got so many potential outlets for Capital — capital C — that Ricardo’s Law of Rent bleeds into every possible cost, from Infrastructure to Education to the Barbershop.</p><p>However.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1584908947495_34685"><div><h2>Lay of the Land: Education is a More Complex Flavor of Cost Disease</h2><p>Conventional wisdom says “a generation” is <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-is-a-generation" target="_blank">about 25 years</a>, plus or minus 5.</p><p>3 months ago, the class of 2022 began their first semester at my alma mater: MIT.&nbsp;</p><p>A Generation ago, the class of 1997 also began their first semester.</p><p>How has this small world of education changed in one Generation?</p><p><strong>Total US College Enrollment Up</strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183995/us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions/" target="_blank"><strong> 39%</strong></a><strong> from 1993 to 2018</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1545864346754_68321"><div><p>How many people actually applied each year?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Modern JavaScript supports many different looping constructs. I often use these
different constructs for working with arrays. This is a reference, for myself
and for others, written to augment the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration">existing</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach">MDN</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>An array <code>arr</code> is defined for all the below examples. The sample code for each
looping construct performs the same behavior.</p>
<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#for-statement"><code>for</code> statement</a></li>
<li><a href="#dowhile-statement"><code>do...while</code> statement</a></li>
<li><a href="#while-statement"><code>while</code> statement</a></li>

<li><a href="#filter-prototype"><code>filter</code> prototype</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-loop-constructs">Basic Loop Constructs</h2>
<h3 id="for-statement"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for_statement"><code>for</code> statement</a></h3>
<p>This is the standard C-style loop.</p>
<pre><code>let arr = ["a","b","c","d"]
for(var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(i, arr[i])
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="dowhile-statement"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#do...while_statement"><code>do...while</code> statement</a></h3>
<p>Repeat until condition is false.</p>
<pre><code>var i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i, arr[i])
    i++
} while (i &lt; arr.length)</code></pre>
<h3 id="while-statement"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#while_statement"><code>while</code> statement</a></h3>
<p>Repeat while condition is true.</p>
<pre><code>var i = 0
while (i &lt; arr.length) {
    console.log(i, arr[i])
    i++
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="object-loop-constructs">Object Loop Constructs</h2>
<h3 id="forin-statement"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for...in_statement"><code>for...in</code> statement</a></h3>
<p>Executes on the properties (indices) of an object. In JavaScript, Arrays are objects, so
this is valid.</p>
<pre><code>for(var i in arr) {
    console.log(i, arr[i])
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="forof-statement"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for...of_statement"><code>for...of</code> statement</a></h3>
<p>Loops over the values of iterable objects including Array, Map and Set.</p>
<pre><code>var i = 0
for(var val of arr) {
    console.log(i, val)
    i++
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>for...of</code> loops the values, while <code>for...in</code> loops the properties/indices.</p>
<h2 id="functional-loop-constructs">Functional Loop Constructs</h2>
<p>Multiple functional-style prototypes exist on the Array object. Handy for
list comprehensions or for rewriting complicated loops with simpler syntax,
especially with <code>reduce</code> and <code>filter</code>. Promotes immutability.</p>
<h3 id="map-prototype"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"><code>map</code> prototype</a></h3>
<p>Calls a callback function once for each element and returns the resulting array.
This map callback prints trivial debug information for the array.</p>
<pre><code>function callback(value, index, array) {
    console.log(index, value)
    return `value: ${value}, index: ${index}`;
}
var mappedArr = arr.map(callback)</code></pre>
<p>Does not mutate the source array.</p>
<h3 id="reduce-prototype"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce"><code>reduce</code> prototype</a></h3>
<p>Calls a reducer callback to accumulate the array values into a single value.
This reducer callback joins the array with commas, similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join"><code>Array.prototype.join()</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>function reducer(accumulator, value, index, array) {
    console.log(index, value)
    return accumulator + "," + value
}
var initialValue = ""
var joined = arr.reduce(reducer, initialValue)</code></pre>
<p>Does not mutate the source array. Note that if the <code>initialValue</code> parameter is
not included in the <code>arr.reduce()</code> call, the initial value is set to <code>array[0]</code>
and that first index will be skipped in the loop.</p>
<h3 id="filter-prototype"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter"><code>filter</code> prototype</a></h3>
<p>Calls a filter callback to create a filtered array from the source array. The <code>filter</code> prototype
is very useful for cleaning <em>sparse arrays</em> as illustrated below or for, of course, filtering data
based on a condition in a more readable manner than with a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<pre><code>function filter(value, index, array) {
    console.log(index, value)
    return typeof value !== 'undefined'
}
var filtered = arr.filter(filter)</code></pre>
<p>Does not mutate the source array.</p>

adding a <strong>manifest with icons for your home and splash screen</strong>, and finally, making your PWA <strong>compatible with iOS</strong> devices.</p></blockquote><p>At the beginning of this year, I started working on a project in my company where I would transform a ReactJS application for booking events
into a Progressive Web App. When I started to look into the topic, I couldn't find a resource that explained all the things I needed to know
to get started and that would cover the entire process of converting an existing ReactJS application into a Progressive Web App at a production-ready state.</p><p>I'll first explain to you the things you need to know about Progressive Web Apps to get started and afterward, I'll walk you, step by step,
through the process of making your ReactJS app a <strong> <em>Progressive</em> Web App</strong>.</p><p>If you follow along with the tutorial and there are any open questions or you got stuck, <strong>don't hesitate to contact me</strong>. You can find my contact information at the bottom
of this page.</p><blockquote><p>If you still need to sell the people at your company on developing a Progressive Web App, check out this <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">link</a>,
which provides lots of case studies that show that <strong>Progressive Web Apps increase customer retention, performance, and mobile experience</strong>.</p></blockquote><h5 id="table-of-contents"><a href="#table-of-contents" aria-label="table of contents permalink"></a>Table of Contents</h5><ul><li><p><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#tools">Tools</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#terminology">Terminology</a></p><ul><li><p><a href="#application-shell">Application Shell</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#progressive-web-app">Progressive Web App</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#service-worker">Service Worker</a></p><ul><li><a href="#lifecycle">Lifecycle</a></li><li><a href="#caching-strategies">Caching strategies</a></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="#web-app-manifest">Web App Manifest</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="#debugging">Debugging</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#tutorial">Tutorial</a></p><ul><li><p><a href="#service-worker-setup">Service Worker Setup</a></p><ul><li><a href="#webpack">Webpack</a></li><li><a href="#create-the-service-worker-file">Create the Service Worker file</a></li><li><a href="#get-it-working-with-typescript">Get it working with TypeScript</a></li><li><a href="#and-eslint">...and ESLint</a></li><li><a href="#register-the-service-worker">Register the Service Worker</a></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="#adding-a-manifest-file">Adding a manifest file</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#making-it-ios-compatible">Making it iOS compatible</a></p><ul><li><a href="#home-screen-icon">Home screen icon</a></li><li><a href="#fullscreen-mode">Fullscreen mode</a></li><li><a href="#splash-screen">Splash screen</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></p></li></ul><undefined></undefined><h2 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites" aria-label="prerequisites permalink"></a>Prerequisites</h2><p>This tutorial is for you if...</p><ul><li>you want to get into Progressive Web Apps but <strong>don't know where to start</strong>.</li><li>you want to get a <strong>better understanding of PWAs</strong> and of the terms around them.</li><li>you want to <strong>make your React app a <em>Progressive</em> Web App</strong>.</li><li>you are using <strong>Webpack</strong> for bundling your code.</li></ul><h5 id="webpack"><a href="#webpack" aria-label="webpack permalink"></a>Webpack</h5><p>Webpack is a <em>static module bundler</em> for JavaScript that we use for bundling our React project.</p><p>Create-React-App already uses Webpack under the hood, but having your own Webpack configuration gives you more control over the Service Worker.</p><h5 id="workbox"><a href="#workbox" aria-label="workbox permalink"></a>Workbox</h5><p>Workbox is a set of libraries, developed by Google, that facilitates setting up a Progressive Web App.</p><p>We will be using their <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin">Webpack plugins</a>

</span></p><p>The installation process of a PWA doesn't involve an app store. It's installed directly through the browser.</p><p>PWAs are supported both on mobile and desktop browsers. As of writing this, all major browsers offer at least basic support.
Chrome offers full support on mobile and desktop, Safari and Firefox allow PWAs to be installed only on mobile.
All major browsers offer support for Service Workers, which is the core-technology powering PWAs. Check out this article if you want to know more about
the <a href="https://medium.com/@firt/progressive-web-apps-in-2020-c15018c9931c">state of PWAs in 2020</a>.</p><p>Progressive Web Apps are a <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> of your app. This means that even though not all features are available on all platforms,
the worst case is that people will use your page as a simple website.</p><p>The two very essential features that a Progressive Web App should have is a <strong>Service Worker</strong> and a <strong>manifest</strong>
(and the equivalent meta tags on iOS for full compatibility).</p><p>We'll now have a close look at what these two things are:</p><h3 id="service-worker"><a href="#service-worker" aria-label="service worker permalink"></a>Service Worker</h3><p>Service Workers are the core-technology behind PWAs. They are an extension of Web Workers. They enable native features like an <strong>offline experience</strong>
or <strong>push notifications</strong>.</p><p>Just like Web Workers, Service Workers allow JavaScript code to be run in the background. But they have a few additional capabilities. Service Workers
don't stop when the current tab is closed, which is crucial for offering push notifications.</p><p>Another important feature is that they can intercept network requests. This is important for adding offline capabilities to our app.</p><p><span>

</span></p><p>Once installed, the Service Worker will first serve requests from the cache when possible.<br>What we see here is Workbox's "Stale-While-Revalidate" caching strategy.</p><p>Let's see how this works more in detail:</p><h4 id="lifecycle"><a href="#lifecycle" aria-label="lifecycle permalink"></a>Lifecycle</h4><p>A Service Worker has different states it goes through before and after controlling your page.
The browser will compare any new Service Worker file to the old one.</p><p>If there are any changes, the new version will <em>eventually</em> control the page. By default, a new Service Worker will keep <strong>waiting
until all tabs of the browser with the website open are closed.</strong> There are a few ways you can force the Service Worker to update faster,
I explain this in another tutorial about <a href="https://felixgerschau.com/create-a-pwa-update-notification-with-create-react-app/">how to create a PWA update notification</a>.</p><p>It's important to <strong>disable caching on the Service Worker file</strong>, so new Service Worker versions can be detected immediately.
You can do so by setting the <code>max-age</code> header to 0. How to do this exactly depends on your CDN and server configuration.</p><p><span>

Since there aren't many use-cases for this, I didn't include it
in this overview.</p><h3 id="web-app-manifest"><a href="#web-app-manifest" aria-label="web app manifest permalink"></a>Web App Manifest</h3><p>Having a Service Worker controlling your page is one important part of PWAs, but it's only half of the equation. Only installing a Service
Worker will give your site offline capabilities and the possibility to add push notifications, but it still lacks the "look and feel"
of a native application.</p><p>That's where the Web App Manifest comes into play. It's a JSON file called <code>manifest.json</code>, located at the root of your project.
With this file, you'll be able to add a <strong>splash screen, name, icons</strong>, and more to your app.</p><p>Let's have a look at what are the essential fields for a PWA:</p><ul><li><p><strong>name</strong> and <strong>short_name</strong></p><p>The short name is what will be displayed on the home screen below your icon. The full name will be used in the android splash screen.</p></li><li><p><strong>start_url</strong></p><p>The entry point of the installed app.</p></li><li><p><strong>display</strong></p><p>Possible values are <code>fullscreen</code>, <code>standalone</code>, <code>minimal-ui</code>, and <code>browser</code>.
You probably want to use <code>fullscreen</code>, which will make the URL-bar disappear.</p></li><li><p><strong>icons</strong></p><p>These will be used for the app icon and the generated splash screen.</p></li><li><p><strong>theme_color</strong></p><p>This affects how the operating system displays the application. For example, this color can be used in the task switcher.</p></li><li><p><strong>background_color</strong></p><p>This color will be shown while the application's styles are loading.</p></li></ul><p>Be aware that the manifest is <strong>not <em>fully</em> compatible with iOS right now</strong>. On iOS, you'll need to specify the equivalent <code>meta</code> or <code>link</code> tags for these fields.
I'll explain what tags you need to add in the tutorial later on.</p><h2 id="debugging"><a href="#debugging" aria-label="debugging permalink"></a>Debugging</h2><p>To see whether your page's PWA capabilities are fully working there are a few places you can check in the Chrome DevTools:</p><h5 id="manifest"><a href="#manifest" aria-label="manifest permalink"></a>Manifest</h5><p>Under <code>Application</code> -&gt; <code>Manifest</code> you can see what fields are missing or have invalid values:</p><p><span>

<p>If you have ever used a visual editor — a WYSIWYG designer or a Graphics editor, you'd expect to be able to resize and rotate the selected shape or element. These are common operations, and yet when applied together can cause a bit of an itchy head.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Let's take the most common use case - a rectangle (<em>Elements on a web page have a bounding rectangle, and vectors in graphics have a rectangular bounding box</em>). We usually represent the rectangle with four numbers - the <code>x, y</code> coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle, and the <code>width, height</code> of the rectangle.</p>
<p>For resizing this rectangle, common practice is to add four draggable handles at the corners of the rectangle. You can also add four additional handles in the middle of each side to resize in only one direction. <strong>For simplicity, I'm going to just add one handle</strong> - handle to move the bottom right corner of the rectangle.</p>
<p>To resize, one calculates how much <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> units the user has dragged the handle. Let's call the change in the values to be <code>𝝙x</code> and <code>𝝙y</code>. The new width and height of the rectangle would be <code>width + 𝝙x</code> and <code>height + 𝝙y</code> respectively.</p>
<p>Try dragging the bottom right handle in the rectangle below to see it resize.</p>

<p>In the interactive example above, there'a top handle which can be used to rotate the rectangle. <strong>Try rotating the rectangle above and then resize it.</strong> What do you see?</p>
<p>You will notice a couple of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you resize the rectangle, the shape tends to move. i.e. you are dragging the bottom-right corner, but somehow the top-left corner is also moving.</li>
<li>The second one may be a bit more subtle to notice. The distance you drag horizontally or vertically does not quite match with the change in size you perceive in the rotated shape.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What's Happening?</h2>
<p>The rectangle is rotated about its center. In the diagram below <code>A'</code> is the new location of the top-left corner <code>A</code>.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="How a rectangle is rotated" loading="lazy" width="491" height="351" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/resizing-rotated-elements/rot1.png">
</figure>
<p>When you increase the width by <code>𝝙x</code> and height by <code>𝝙x</code> you end up moving the center of the shape. Even though you have not changed the coordinates of <code>A</code>, the coordinates of <code>A'</code> will be different.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Rotated rectangle with different size moved the center" loading="lazy" width="607" height="412" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/resizing-rotated-elements/rot2.png">
</figure>
<p>This accounts for the first issue. The second issue is that we are changing the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> based on the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> changes of the bottom-right corner. That would be totally fine when the shape has not been rotated. But for rotated shapes, one needs to calculate the width and height changes based on the angle of rotation. The diagram below represents these changes as <code>𝝙x'</code> and <code>𝝙y'</code>.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Estimating size change on a rotated rectangle" loading="lazy" width="466" height="395" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/resizing-rotated-elements/rot3.png">
</figure>
<h2>The Solution - Do not move A'</h2>
<p>Let's address the first issue. As we move the bottom-right corner we want to ensure that the top-left corner does not change. Which means, <strong>when we resize a rotated rectangle, we should also update its position</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's calculate the coordinates for <code>A'</code>. We can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a> to do that. We also have to consider that the rotation does not happen around the origin of the canvas, but around the center of the rectangle.</p>
<p>First let's establish the center of the rectangle <code>cx, cy</code>:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> cx <span>=</span> rectangle<span>.</span>x <span>+</span> rectangle<span>.</span>width <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> cy <span>=</span> rectangle<span>.</span>y <span>+</span> rectangle<span>.</span>height <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now applying the combined matrix, we can create a <code>rotate</code> function that returns the coordinates after rotation:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>x<span>,</span> y<span>,</span> cx<span>,</span> cy<span>,</span> angle</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>[</span><br>    <span>(</span>x <span>-</span> cx<span>)</span> <span>*</span> Math<span>.</span><span>cos</span><span>(</span>angle<span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span>y <span>-</span> cy<span>)</span> <span>*</span> Math<span>.</span><span>sin</span><span>(</span>angle<span>)</span> <span>+</span> cx<span>,</span><br>    <span>(</span>x <span>-</span> cx<span>)</span> <span>*</span> Math<span>.</span><span>sin</span><span>(</span>angle<span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span>y <span>-</span> cy<span>)</span> <span>*</span> Math<span>.</span><span>cos</span><span>(</span>angle<span>)</span> <span>+</span> cy<span>,</span><br>  <span>]</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>const</span> rotatedA <span>=</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span>rectangle<span>.</span>x<span>,</span> rectangle<span>.</span>y<span>,</span> cx<span>,</span> cy<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>As we were dragging the bottom-right corner of the rectangle, we knew what the value of <code>C'</code> (<code>rotatedC</code> in the code) should be. Since we want <code>A'</code> to remain the same, we can now calculate the new center by finding the midpoint between <code>A'</code> and <code>C'</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> newCenter <span>=</span> <span>[</span><br>  <span>(</span>rotatedA<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> rotatedC<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>(</span>rotatedA<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> rotatedC<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span><br><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now to calculate the new top-left  coordinates for the rectangle, we simply rotate <code>A'</code> around the new center by the reverse angle <code>-angle</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> newA <span>=</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span>rotatedA<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> rotatedA<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> newCenter<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> newCenter<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span>angle<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Setting the <code>x, y</code> of the rectangle to <code>newA</code> will ensure that the rotated rectangle does not visually shift when resized.</p>
<h2>Adjusted Width And Height</h2>
<p>Now let's deal with the second issue - we need a projection of what the width and height should be when there is no rotation. The answer is to build on top of the first solution.</p>
<p>We can calculate the unrotated coordinates of the bottom-right corner <code>C</code> by rotating the new coordinates of <code>C'</code> around the new center by the reverse angle.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> newC <span>=</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span>rotatedC<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> rotatedC<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> newCenter<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> newCenter<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span>angle<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>The width and height of the rectangle can be calculated by measuring the difference in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values of <code>newC</code> and <code>newA</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> newWidth <span>=</span> newC<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> newA<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> newHeight <span>=</span> newC<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> newA<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Here's the solution implemented for you to play with:</p>

<p>The code put together:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>adjustRectangle</span><span>(</span><span>rectangle<span>,</span> bottomRightX<span>,</span> bottomRightY<span>,</span> angle</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> center <span>=</span> <span>[</span><br>    rectangle<span>.</span>x <span>+</span> rectangle<span>.</span>width <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span><br>    rectangle<span>.</span>y <span>+</span> rectangle<span>.</span>height <span>/</span> <span>2</span><br>  <span>]</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>const</span> rotatedA <span>=</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span>rectangle<span>.</span>x<span>,</span> rectangle<span>.</span>y<span>,</span> cx<span>,</span> cy<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>const</span> newCenter <span>=</span> <span>[</span><br>    <span>(</span>rotatedA<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> bottomRightX<span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span><br>    <span>(</span>rotatedA<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> bottomRightY<span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>]</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>const</span> newTopLeft <span>=</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span><br>    rotatedA<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>    rotatedA<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>    newCenter<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>    newCenter<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>    <span>-</span>angle<br>  <span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBottomRight <span>=</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span><br>    bottomRightX<span>,</span><br>    bottomRightY<span>,</span><br>    newCenter<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>    newCenter<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>    <span>-</span>angle<br>  <span>)</span><span>;</span><p>  rectangle<span>.</span>x <span>=</span> newTopLeft<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>  rectangle<span>.</span>y <span>=</span> newTopLeft<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>  rectangle<span>.</span>width <span>=</span> newBottomRight<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> newTopLeft<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>  rectangle<span>.</span>height <span>=</span> newBottomRight<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> newTopLeft<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>

<p>Dbus and Polkit are two technologies that emanate an aura of
confusion. While their names are omnipresent in discussions, and the
internet has its share of criticism and rants about them, not many have
a grasp of what they actually do. In this article I’ll give an
overview of these technologies.</p>

<p>D-Bus, or Desktop Bus, is often described as a software that allows other
processes to communicate with one another, to perform inter-process
communication (IPC). However, this term is generic and doesn’t convey
what it is used for. Many technologies exist that can perform IPC, from
plain socket, to messaging queue, so what differentiates D-Bus from them.</p>

<p>D-Bus can be considered a middleware, a software glue that sits
in the middle to provide services to software through a sort
of plugin/microkernel architecture. That’s what the bus metaphor
represents, it replicates the functionality of hardware buses, with
components attaching themselves to known interfaces that they implement,
and providing a mean of communication between them. With D-Bus these can
be either procedure calls aka methods or signals aka notifications.</p>

<p>While D-Bus does offer 1-to-1 and 1-to-many IPC, it’s more of a byproduct
of its original purpose than a mean of efficient process to process data
transfer — it isn’t meant to be fast. D-Bus emerges from the world of
desktop environments where blocks are well known, and each implements a
functionality that should be accessible from other processes if needed
without having to reinvent the transfer mechanism for each and every
software.<br>
This is the problem it tackles: having components in a desktop environment
that are distributed in many processes, each fulfilling a specific job. In
such case, if a process implements the behavior needed, instead of
reimplementing it, it can instead harness the feature already provided
by that other process.</p>

<p>Its design is heavily influenced by Service Oriented Architectures
(SOA), Enterprise Service Buses (ESB), and microkernel architectures.<br>
A bus permits abstracting communication between software, replacing
all direct contact, and only allowing them to happen on the bus
instead.<br>
Additionally, the SOA allows software to expose objects that have
methods that can be called remotely, and also allows other software to
subscribe/publish events happening in remote objects residing in
other software.<br>
Moreover, D-Bus provides an easy plug-and-play, a loose coupling,
where any software could detach itself from the bus and allow another
process to be plugged, containing objects that implement the same features
the previous process implemented.<br>
In sum, it’s an abstraction layer for functionalities that could be
implemented by any software, a standardized way to create pluggable
desktop components. This is what D-Bus is about, this is the role it
plays, and it explains the difficulty in grasping the concepts that
gave rise to it.</p>

<p>The big conceptual picture goes as follows.<br>
We have a D-Bus daemon running at an address and services that implement
well known behaviors. These services attach to the D-Bus daemon and the
attachment edge has a name, a bus name.<br>
Inside these services, there are objects that implement the well known
behavior. These objects also have a path leading to them so that you
can target which object within that service implements the specific
interface needed.<br>
Then, the interface methods and events can be called or registered
on this object inside this service, connected to this bus name, from
another service that requires the behavior implemented by that interface
to be executed.</p>

<p>This is how these particular nested components interact with one another,
and it gives rise to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Address of D-Bus daemon -&gt;
Bus Name that the service attached to -&gt;
Path of the object within this service -&gt;
Interface that this object implements -&gt;
Method or Signal concrete implementation
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or in graphical form:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/dbus_polkit/dbus_method_invocation.png" alt="D-Bus ecosystem"></p>

<p>Instead of having everyone talk to one another:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/dbus_polkit/processes_without_dbus.png" alt="p2p interaction"></p>

<p>Let’s take a method call example that shows these 3 required pieces
of information.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>org.gnome.SessionManager \
/org/gnome/SessionManager \
org.gnome.SessionManager.CanShutdown

   boolean true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we have the service bus name <code>org.gnome.SessionManager</code>, the
object path <code>/org/gnome/SessionManager</code>, and the interface/method name
<code>org.gnome.SessionManager.CanShutdown</code>, all separated by spaces. If the
<code>/org/gnome/SessionManager</code> only implements a single interface then we
could call it as such <code>CanShutdown</code>, but here it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Let’s dive deeper into the pieces we’ve mentioned. They are akin to
the ones in an SOA ecosystem, but with the addition of the bus name,
bus daemon, and the abstraction for the plug-and-play.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objects</li>
</ul>

<p>An object is an entity that resides in a process/service and that
effectuates some work. It is identified by a path name. The path name is
usually written, though not mandatory, in a namespace format where it
is grouped and divided by slashes <code>/</code>, just like Unix file system path.</p>

<p>For example: <code>/org/gnome/Nautilus/window/1</code>.</p>

<p>Objects have methods and signals, methods take input and return output,
while signals are events that processes can subscribe to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>These methods and signals are concrete implementations of interfaces,
the same definition as in OOP.<br>
As with OOP, interfaces are a group of abstractions that have to be
defined in the object that implements them. The members, methods and
signals, are also namespaced under this interface name.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>interface=org.gnome.Shell.Introspect
member method=GetRunningApplications
absolute name of method=org.gnome.Shell.Introspect.GetRunningApplications
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some interfaces are commonly implemented by objects, such as the
<code>org.freedesktop.Introspectable</code> interface, which, as the name implies,
makes the object introspectable. It allows to query the object about
its capabilities, features, and other interfaces it implements. This is
a very useful feature because it allows discovery.<br>
It’s also worth mentioning that dbus can be used in a generic
way to set and get properties of services’ objects through the
<code>org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties</code> interface.</p>

<p>Interfaces can be described as standard, and for documentation, in D-Bus
XML configuration files so that other programmers can use the reference
to implement them properly. These files can also be used to auto-generate
classes from the XML, making it quicker to implement and less error-prone.<br>
These files can usually be found under <code>/usr/share/dbus-1/interfaces/</code>.
Our <code>org.gnome.Shell.Introspect</code> of earlier is there in the
file <code>org.gnome.Shell.Introspect.xml</code> along with our method
<code>GetRunningApplications</code>. Here’s an excerpt of the relevant section.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt;!--
	GetRunningApplications:
	@short_description: Retrieves the description of all running applications

	Each application is associated by an application ID. The details of
	each application consists of a varlist of keys and values. Available
	keys are listed below.

	'active-on-seats' - (as)   list of seats the application is active on
								(a seat only has at most one active
								application)
--&gt;
&lt;method name="GetRunningApplications"&gt;
	&lt;arg name="apps" direction="out" type="a{sa{sv}}" /&gt;
&lt;/method&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the <code>type=</code> part, which describes the format of the output,
we’ll come back to what this means in the message format section,
but in short each letter represents a basic type. The <code>out</code> direction
means that it’s the type of an output value of the method, similarly
<code>in</code> is for method parameters. See the following example taken from
<code>org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot.xml</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt;!--
	ScreenshotArea:
	@x: the X coordinate of the area to capture
	@y: the Y coordinate of the area to capture
	@width: the width of the area to capture
	@height: the height of the area to capture
	@flash: whether to flash the area or not
	@filename: the filename for the screenshot
	@success: whether the screenshot was captured
	@filename_used: the file where the screenshot was saved

	Takes a screenshot of the passed in area and saves it
	in @filename as png image, it returns a boolean
	indicating whether the operation was successful or not.
	@filename can either be an absolute path or a basename, in
	which case the screenshot will be saved in the $XDG_PICTURES_DIR
	or the home directory if it doesn't exist. The filename used
	to save the screenshot will be returned in @filename_used.
--&gt;
&lt;method name="ScreenshotArea"&gt;
	&lt;arg type="i" direction="in" name="x"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="i" direction="in" name="y"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="i" direction="in" name="width"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="i" direction="in" name="height"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="b" direction="in" name="flash"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="s" direction="in" name="filename"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="b" direction="out" name="success"/&gt;
	&lt;arg type="s" direction="out" name="filename_used"/&gt;
&lt;/method&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Proxies</li>
</ul>

<p>Proxies are the nuts and bolts of an RPC ecosystem, they represent
remote objects, along with their methods, in your native code as if
they were local. Basically, these are wrappers to make it more simple
to manipulate things on D-Bus programmatically instead of worrying about
all the components we’ve mentioned above. Programming with proxies might
look like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Proxy proxy = new Proxy(getBusConnection(), "/remote/object/path");
Object returnValue = proxy.MethodName(arg1, arg2);
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Bus names</li>
</ul>

<p>The bus name, or also sometimes called connection name, is the name
of the connection that an application gets assigned when it connects
to D-Bus. Because D-Bus is a bus architecture, it requires that each
assigned name be unique, you can’t have two applications using the
same bus name. Usually, it is the D-Bus daemon that generates this
random unique value, one that begins with a colon by convention,
however, applications may ask to own well-known names instead. These
well-known names, as reverse domain names, are for cases when people
want to agree on a standard unique application that should implement
a certain behavior. Let’s say for instance a specification for a
<code>com.mycompany.TextEditor</code> bus name, …</p></article></div>

July 6, 2020 | https://www.codingnagger.com/2020/07/06/data-migration-gotchas-and-lessons-learned/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.codingnagger.com/2020/07/06/data-migration-gotchas-and-lessons-learned/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A fair while ago I went through a data migration project and a few days ago I chatted with one of our architects to go through the various steps and the solution that I had picked up and<br>developed further. I think he needed the information for another data migration project he’ll be on.</p><p>As I went through it with him, I brought up the various data migration gotchas and issues we ran into. I now realise these can be useful to a larger number of people working on data migration projects. I heard these were quite common, mostly for companies that start a digital transformation. A data migration project will generally be about building a solution that will allow you to extract your legacy data, to transform it and eventually load it into your new system storage.</p><p>Surprisingly, I only worked on one data migration project since I jumped in the software world twelve years ago. It feels like yesterday that I was struggling to learn SQL. This one quite interesting you revolve exclusively around using procedural SQL on both Oracle and MariaDB. You will guess for yourself which one was the legacy system and which was the new shiny target. But this is not what today is about, today is about the biggest gotchas that I believe delayed our delivery. Views are my own, facts are for everyone, yada yada yada.</p><h2>Using SQL scripts as a primary tool</h2><p>I am actually starting with one gotcha that I didn’t highlight to my colleague yesterday that came back to my mind this morning. Don’t get me wrong, SQL is a powerful tool to retrieve and display data. However, when you have a team of several developers working on a codebase, making sure your changes integrate well with others is key.</p><p>The problem is that to validate different scenarios, we couldn’t just run classic unit tests for a few seconds or a couple of minutes. We could only run the actual migration, I wouldn’t call these integration tests because the environment would be different from the actual one (more on that later).</p><p>We had to spin up docker images then load dummy data for each scenario we prepared to face with the real data. I think our Jenkins builds at one point took up to 2-3 hours to complete. This makes local development harder as nobody would want to apply changes for 5 minutes to run tests for 2-3 hours, at first we moved towards running only the tests we were interested in. That painfully <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.codingnagger.com/2019/01/31/slow-ci/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow CI even inspired a post of mine from last year</a>. Eventually, we got it down to 40ish minutes, still slow but probably the best we could do considering what we were dealing with.</p><p>Now, I am not speaking from experience but a couple of architects I discussed with while and even after that project told me that using an actual programming language would have saved us from that pain. There you can test any component for every bit of retrieval, transformation and load in seconds. Then have a single integration test with your happy path scenario. We could have had CI builds running in under a minute. Lots of time that could have been saved.</p><h2>Mismatching source and target fields</h2><p>Mismatches were such a big pain point. I do not mean mistakenly pushing data from a legacy field to the wrong target field. I mean pushing data exactly where it should be but the target field has the wrong type. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, there was no getting our hands on the real data while developing the solution.</p><p>These issues only exposed themselves during production runs. You can have source fields that are strings matched with target fields that were integers. When all the test data contains numbers for that field it’s okay. But when you get even a couple of entries out of millions that turn out to have letters, all hell breaks loose. Other times data would be truncated because the target database would have target fields smaller than the ones there are meant to replicate from the source system. This one is not so much a data migration issue as we were not responsible for the target system design but that actually forced us to go and fix it as we were delivering that data migration solution. So yeah, not optimal.</p><p>The takeaway here would be, if you’re building a newer version of a system, make sure that the new database fields will actually match the format and type of the source data. We can’t afford to truncate addresses or phone numbers. Especially when the system requires that information.</p><h2>Lack of boundaries with other teams</h2><p>My team focus at that time is data migration. We build a solution to move data from one place to another. However, as mentioned above, we occasionally had to fix a target database built by other teams for various features. On top of that, I’m not sure how nor why we became the test data providers for other teams. Basically, instead of putting together test data to test their features, these teams would contact us to give them random database dumps.</p><p>It is quite silly in retrospect. So we had a class in the testing framework we built that we used to generate data. Data that we pushed to the source databases while we developed, then ran through the migration process to extract, transform and load it to the target database. Then extract a data dump from that target system to send it to them. It made sense to us because we didn’t want to craft target data when it wasn’t our role. However, I believe our boundary was too liberal. We should have put the bound at “you should craft your test data” stop there.</p><p>While it is good to help people where you can, you can’t do that to the point where you can’t do your own work. In the end, we were responsible for three massive parts of that project: data migration, fixing the target database and generating test data for everyone.</p><h2>Different environment setups</h2><p>I remember that back then, I didn’t think much of different setups between the various deployed environments. From dev to staging to production there were quite a few differences, which obviously we paid a price for down the line. Having different versions of Oracle DB or MariaDB shouldn’t be a big deal right? What about when the difference between a version and the next breaks all your SQL scripts. Like having to replace <strong><em>VALUES </em></strong>to <strong><em>VALUE</em></strong>.</p><p> Imagine the pain of getting your migration tool working locally, then push it through a slow CI process. Next, you deploy it to an environment, running your migration process and checks. All this for it to break in production because the MariaDB instance in production is older. Additionally, it was set up on an EC2 instance when the one in the staging environment was an RDS.</p><p>Working on a project where all the various environments you use for development are identical to production the output difference screams at me. You avoid a host of pains due to fix your code to work with all your integration environments. There is something wrong if the environments that should prove your solution works in production are nothing like production. Definitely the biggest learning I got from that experience.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>I will carry the lessons I learned through that old project for the rest of my life. I might even revisit this post to make sure I do not forget as these will be very useful the next time I work on data migration. Better yet, some of these can apply to more than just data migrations.</p><p> Even though I did not get to pick the tool in this case, this experience enforced my belief in picking the best tool for a job. While it is good to trust the information you get, it won’t hurt to have a look and confirm yourself. Sometimes it is as quick as a SQL query.</p><p>Next, make sure that wherever possible the environments you use to develop a solution match the production environments. You will avoid a host of integration issues.</p><p>And finally, when you have clearly defined responsibilities, avoid picking up new ones that will become a liability for your core work. Sergio Ramos isn’t the best defender in the world because he scored more than Firmino this season. He is the best because he actually does his defending work first which he excels at, then occasional goes and score a goal.</p><p>Thank you for reading.

<p>In February 2018 I wrote what would become the most relevant text I have ever published: <a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/en/post/2018-03-05-clean-architecture-using-go/">Clean Architecture using Golang</a>. With more than 105k views, the post generated presentations at some Go and PHP events and allowed me to talk about software architecture with several people.</p>

<p>Using this architecture for the development of <a href="https://codenation.dev/">Codenation</a>’s products, we gained experience and solved problems. We wrote some posts reporting these experiences:</p>

</ul>

<p>After this whole experience I can say::</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Choosing Clean Architecture was the best technical decision we made!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this post, I want to share a <a href="https://github.com/eminetto/clean-architecture-go-v2">repository</a> with a new example implementation in Go. It is an update with improvements in the organization of codes and directories, as well as a more complete example for those who are looking to implement this architecture.</p>

<p>In the next topics, I explain what each directory means.</p>

<h2 id="entity-layer">Entity layer</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the innermost layer of the architecture.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob’s post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Entities encapsulate <em>Enterprise wide</em> business rules. An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions. It doesn’t matter so long as the entities could be used by many different applications in the enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The structure looked like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/1-entity_book.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/1-entity_book.png" alt="entity"></a></p>

<p>In this package, we have the definition of the entity (<code>entity.go</code>) and the interfaces of the <code>Repository</code> and <code>Manager</code> (in <code>interface.go</code>). The <code>Manager</code> will use a <code>Repository</code> to perform basic operations on the entity, such as the famous <code>CRUD</code>.</p>

<p>We also have the implementations of the repository in <code>MySQL</code> (<code>repository_mysql.go</code>) and in-memory (<code>repository_inmem.go</code>), as well as the implementation of the <code>Manager</code> interface (in <code>manager.go</code>).</p>

<p>We also found the <code>mocks</code> generated by <code>Gomock</code>, as explained in this <a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/en/post/2019-12-19-gomock/">post</a>. The other layers of the architecture will use this mocks during the tests.</p>

<h2 id="use-case-layer">Use Case Layer</h2>

<p>According to Uncle Bob::</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The software in this layer contains application specific business rules. It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The structure looked like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/2-domain_loan.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/2-domain_loan.png" alt="domain"></a></p>

<p>In packages within <code>domain/usecase</code> we implement the business rules for our product. According to the definition of the architecture, these <code>UseCases</code> make use of the entities and the <code>Managers</code> that deal with them. It is also possible to see the existence of mocks, as the previous layer.</p>

<h2 id="controller-layer">Controller layer</h2>

<p>In this application, there are two ways to access the <code>UseCases</code>. The first is through an <code>API</code> and the second is using a command line application (<code>CLI</code>).</p>

<p>The <code>CLI</code>’s structure is very simple:</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/4-cmd.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/4-cmd.png" alt="cli"></a></p>

<p>It makes use of domain packages to perform a book search:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dataSourceName</span> <span>:=</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Sprintf</span><span>(</span><span>"%s:%s@tcp(%s:3306)/%s?parseTime=true"</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>DB_USER</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>DB_PASSWORD</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>DB_HOST</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>DB_DATABASE</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sql</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>"mysql"</span><span>,</span> <span>dataSourceName</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span>
<span>repo</span> <span>:=</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>NewMySQLRepository</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>)</span>
<span>manager</span> <span>:=</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>NewManager</span><span>(</span><span>repo</span><span>)</span>
<span>all</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>manager</span><span>.</span><span>Search</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>j</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>all</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%s %s \n"</span><span>,</span> <span>j</span><span>.</span><span>Title</span><span>,</span> <span>j</span><span>.</span><span>Author</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above, you can see the use of the <code>config</code> package. You can see its structure below, and more details in this <a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/post/2018-06-25-golang-usando-build-tags/">post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/3-config.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/3-config.png" alt="config"></a></p>

<p>The <code>API</code> structure is more complex, with three packages: <code>handler</code>, <code>presenter</code>, and <code>middleware</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>handler</code> package handle <code>HTTP</code> <code>requests</code> and <code>responses</code>, as well as using existing business rules in the <code>domain</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/5-handler.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/5-handler.png" alt="handler"></a></p>

<p>The <code>presenters</code> are responsible for formatting the data generated as a <code>response</code> by <code>handlers</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/6-presenter.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/6-presenter.png" alt="presenter"></a></p>

<p>In this way, the entity <code>User</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>ID</span>        <span>entity</span><span>.</span><span>ID</span>
   <span>Email</span>     <span>string</span>
   <span>Password</span>  <span>string</span>
   <span>FirstName</span> <span>string</span>
   <span>LastName</span>  <span>string</span>
   <span>CreatedAt</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Time</span>
   <span>UpdatedAt</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Time</span>
   <span>Books</span>     <span>[]</span><span>entity</span><span>.</span><span>ID</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It can be transformed into:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>ID</span>        <span>entity</span><span>.</span><span>ID</span> <span>`json:"id"`</span>
   <span>Email</span>     <span>string</span>    <span>`json:"email"`</span>
   <span>FirstName</span> <span>string</span>    <span>`json:"first_name"`</span>
   <span>LastName</span>  <span>string</span>    <span>`json:"last_name"`</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This gives us control over how an entity will be delivered via the <code>API</code>.</p>

<p>In the last package of the <code>API</code> we find the <code>middlewares</code>, used by several <code>endpoints</code>:</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/7-middleware.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/7-middleware.png" alt="middlware"></a></p>

<h2 id="support-packages">Support packages</h2>

<p>They are packages that provide common functionality such as encryption, logging, file handling, etc. These features are not part of the domain of our application, and all the layers can use them. Even other applications can import and use these packages.</p>

<p><a href="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/8-pkg.png"><img src="https://eltonminetto.dev/images/posts/8-pkg.png" alt="pkg"></a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/eminetto/clean-architecture-go-v2">README.md</a> contains more details, such as instructions for compilation and usage examples.</p>

<p>My goals with this post to strengthen my recommendation on this architecture and also to receive feedback about the codes.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to use this architecture in your favorite programming language, you could use this repository as an example of this learning. That way, we can have different implementations, in different languages, to ease the comparison.</p>

<p>Special thanks to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/hurrycaner">Gustavo Schirmer</a>  who gave great feedbacks on the text and the codes.</p>

The more I worked with paper, the more I fell in love with its versatility. At some point, I got the idea to make a model of an airplane as a way of challenging myself with an unconventional shape.</p><p>Though the project began on a much smaller and simpler scale in mid-2008, it has since evolved through multiple revisions to become a highly detailed, true-to-life representation of a Boeing 777. I originally drew my plans by hand, but my desire to increase the accuracy and amount of detail led me to start using Adobe Illustrator to design and print increasingly intricate parts directly onto the folder.</p><p><em>The project has been in progress since May 2008</em></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559711406501_11179"><div><h2>RESEARCH</h2><p>I start with as much source material as I can. Often that means photos and videos found on the web, but sometimes I’m lucky enough to get my hands on technical drawings as well. I study these materials to form an understanding of the intrinsic shape and function of the particular section I’m working on. Once I feel confident in my basic understanding of the part, I can begin the design process.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559711406501_13965"><div><h2>DESIGN</h2><p>Much of my work consists of figuring out how to flatten 3-D shapes into 2-D slices that can be printed onto paper and assembled. I work in Adobe Illustrator to create 2-D plans for all the parts of which the final product will be comprised. I typically start the process by working out the general shape and dimensions of the piece, then I drill down, adding more detail and functionality. Once the design has been “frozen,” I work to break it down into individual pieces and arrange them for printing. Often, if a piece is complex and I’m unsure of how well it will function in reality, I build a small test section to verify my designs.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559711406501_16684"><div><h2>PRINTING &amp; ASSEMBLY</h2><p>This stage is as time-consuming as the design process. I cut folders down to printer-friendly sizes and print my plans directly onto them. Then, I cut out the individual pieces using an <a href="http://www.xacto.com/products/cutting-solutions/knives/detail/X3201" target="_blank"><span>Xacto knife</span></a>, arrange them into sections, and glue them together with <a href="https://www.aleenes.com/aleenes-clear-gel-tacky-glue" target="_blank"><span>Tacky Glue</span></a>. Often, a complex piece is actually a collection of much smaller sub-sections that each needs to be assembled separately before being joined together; this is especially true of something like the wing, which contains many articulating functions and thousands of parts.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1561353870131_383468"><div><h2>TOOLS</h2><p>My tools of choice include the aforementioned Xacto knife, a cutting mat, straight edges, squares, and a toothpick for the precise application of glue.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77oRSCxGmYA&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<iframe src=\&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/77oRSCxGmYA?wmode=opaque&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; width=\&quot;854\&quot; scrolling=\&quot;no\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot; allowfullscreen=\&quot;\&quot;>\n</iframe>&quot;,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Video&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Many people have asked how I design and build the parts for the manila folder 777 I'm putting together, and this video is perhaps the best answer yet.

            <p>BEIJING -- 
	While China appears to have reduced coronavirus cases to near zero, other infectious threats remain, with local health authorities announcing a suspected bubonic plague case in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>
	Authorities in the Bayannur district raised the plague warning on Sunday, ordered residents not to hunt wild animals such as marmots and to send for treatment anyone with fever or showing other possible signs of infection.</p>
<p>
	Plague can be fatal in up to 90% of people infected if not treated, primarily with several types of antibiotics.</p>
<p>
	Pneumonic plague can develop from bubonic plague and results in a severe lung infection causing shortness of breath, headache and coughing.</p>
<p>
	China has largely eradicated plague, but occasional cases are still reported, especially among hunters coming into contact with fleas carrying the bacterium. The last major known outbreak was in 2009, when several people died in the town of Ziketan in Qinghai province on the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>
	Along with the coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, China has dealt with African swine fever, which has devastated pig herds.</p>
<p>
	China has gone weeks without reporting a new death from the coronavirus, and on Monday reported just one new case of local infection in the capital, Beijing.</p>

    <h2 id="the-waymo-challenge">The Waymo Challenge</h2>

<p>In August 2019, Waymo shared a portion of their self-driving car’s data as the <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2019/08/waymo-open-dataset-sharing-our-self.html">Waymo Open Dataset</a>.  The data set contains LIDAR point clouds and images from the 5 cameras on the Waymo test cars.  I previously used this dataset as additional training data for <a href="https://github.com/LucasSloan/speedchallenge">my entry</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge">Comma.ai Speed Prediction Challenge</a>.  In March 2020, Waymo released a major update to their dataset and <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/announcing-waymos-open-dataset-challenges.html">announced</a> the <a href="https://waymo.com/open/challenges">Waymo Open Dataset Challenges</a>.  There were five challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>2D Detection</li>
  <li>2D Tracking</li>
  <li>3D Detection</li>
  <li>3D Tracking</li>
  <li>3D Detection Domain Adaptation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-2d-detection-challenge">The 2D Detection Challenge</h2>

<p>Since most of my prior experience was with 2D computer vision tasks, I decided to try my hand at the 2D Detection challenge.  The 2D detection challenge falls under the computer vision task of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection">Object Detection</a>.  Object detection is a more difficult task than the canonical computer vision task of image recognition - in image recognition the model only has to choose which of the supplied labels most applies to the image overall, but in object detection, the model has to localize the objects in the image.</p>

<p>Specifically for the Waymo Challenge, the task was to draw bounding boxes around the vehicles, bikes and pedestrians:</p>

<p><img src="https://lucassloan.github.io/assets/images/ground_truth.png" alt="Sample Waymo bounding boxes" title="Sample Waymo bounding boxes"></p>

<p>There are 5 cameras on the Waymo test vehicle - the front, front right and front left cameras with a resolution of 1920x1280 and the side right and side left cameras with a resolution of 1920x886.</p>

<h2 id="how-object-detection-works">How object detection works</h2>

<p>Almost all object detection models are composed of 2 parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A backbone CNN to extract reduced resolution feature maps</li>
  <li>A smaller CNN to predict the objectness of regions of the feature maps</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lucassloan.github.io/assets/images/object_detection_diagram.jpg" alt="Object detection diagram" title="Object detection diagram"></p>

<p>The backbone CNN, usually lifted from a high performing ImageNet classification model produces reduced resolution “images”.  Then many regions, tiled across the “image”, are snapshotted and fed into the smaller CNN.  The regions of “image” where the smaller CNN fires strongly are the predicted boxes of the overall network.</p>

<p>High performing object detection networks add a number of wrinkles on top of this basic scheme, such as running the smaller CNN over feature maps extracted at multiple resolutions to handle detecting objects of different sizes or adding another small CNN to suggest small offsets from the location implied by the where the snapshot was taken.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-model">Choosing a Model</h2>

<p>After I decided to tackle the 2D Detection challenge, I did a survey of the top models and honed in on 3 top choices:</p>

<h3 id="spinenet"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05027.pdf">SpineNet</a></h3>

<p>SpineNet is a very interesting take on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8c1i45/stack_more_layers/">stack more layers</a> approach to machine learning.  State of the art object detection models snapshot at different resolutions of feature maps, but the higher resolution feature maps are taken earlier in the backbone, which means that they’re the result of less processing.  SpineNet permutes a standard ResNet-50 architecture so that there are feature maps of multiple resolutions at the end of the network, so that all the feature maps can be the result of all 50 layers.</p>

<h3 id="yolov3"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767.pdf">YOLOv3</a></h3>

<p>YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a series of object detection models designed for high speed on commodity hardware.  The project focuses on hardware utilization to guide its design choices, over the raw FLOPs count used by others.</p>

<h3 id="efficientdet"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf">EfficientDet</a></h3>

<p>EfficientDet is a family of models built on top of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf">EfficientNet</a> family of image recognition models.  It uses the EfficientNet models as the CNN backbone and introduces a new method of aggregating information across resolution scales, the BiFPN.</p>

<p>SpineNet seemed like a promising candidate from the paper, but while it was <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/models/official/detection/MODEL_ZOO.md">technically opensource</a>, it was written to be run on TPUs and there wasn’t a community trying to leverage it.  YOLOv3 was designed to be run on commodity GPUs, had a large community and active support from the authors, but it didn’t have state of the art performance and was written in a custom ML framework, darknet.  EfficientDet did have the state of the art performance.  It was open source, supported by the author and a substantial community and written in TensorFlow (the framework I have the most experience with).  I decided to focus on EfficientDet.</p>

<h3 id="training-efficientdet">Training EfficientDet</h3>

<p>After fighting the usual fires trying to get a new model working (formatting the data the way the model wants it, difficulties getting the dependencies installed), I was able to finetune the smallest EfficientDet model.  The smallest EfficientDet, d0, is trained on <a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">the standard COCO dataset</a>, on which it gets an AP of 33.8%.  Unfortunately, finetuning from that checkpoint on the Waymo dataset resulted in much worse performance.</p>

<p>I was able to apply a fact that I had previously learned working on self-driving car data - presenting the frames in order is really bad for performance.  I shuffled my input data better and got much improved performance.  I also changed the learning rate to match the (smaller) batch size that I was training at and got better performance still.  At this point I hit a wall at only 13% AP.  Waymo had preseeded the leaderboard with 2 dummy entries that had ~20% AP, so this clearly wasn’t good enough.</p>

<p>I was training over a period of 10 epochs and the AP basically plateaued after the first 1 or 2 epochs.  I took a look at the code and found that EfficientDet uses a cosine decay rule, so I wondered whether my issue was that the learning rate was falling off too fast.  I switched it out for a constant learning rate, but it had roughly the same performance.  I also tried replacing the default SGD optimizer with an ADAM optimizer, which also had roughly the same performance.</p>

<p>At this point, the deficit versus the COCO AP score had me concerned there was a bug in my code, so I dumped an image with the model’s bounding boxes:</p>

<p><img src="https://lucassloan.github.io/assets/images/sky_boxes.jpg" alt="Sample model detections" title="Sample model detections"></p>

<p>Which made it clear that the model was basically learning, but it did have weird issues with boxes in the sky.  Interestingly, the equivalent boxes from the side cameras (with their different aspect ratio) didn’t have the weird sky boxes.</p>

<p>I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/LucasSloan/waymochallenge/blob/master/dump_tfrecord.py">a tool to dump my tfrecords to json</a> so I could see if there was some obvious flaw in my tfrecord converter, but there wasn’t any.</p>

<p>At this point, faced with consistently worse performance than the COCO dataset, I was concerned that my “finetuning” process was actually making the model worse at detecting things.  The COCO dataset has a bunch of categories that overlap with the Waymo dataset (car, truck -&gt; vehicle), so I was able to write a translation layer that converted the COCO labels to Waymo labels.  With the translation layer, I was able to see what the model’s performance was before finetuning.  EfficientDet d0, the one I was training, had an AP of 6% just mapping the COCO classes, but an AP of 13% after finetuning.  The middle EfficientDet (d4) had a mapped AP of 16% and the largest (d7) had a mapped AP of 19%.</p>

<p>I also took a look at the pictures that comprised the COCO dataset and discovered that the objects in it were usually much larger than the objects in the Waymo dataset.</p>

<p>Between these findings, it was pretty clear that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Finetuning was working (6% -&gt; 13% AP)</li>
  <li>The Waymo dataset was much more challenging that the COCO dataset</li>
  <li>Larger models would perform better</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately there were issues running larger models on the EfficientDet codebase.  It wasn’t designed for multi-gpu training - I attempted to use <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/Strategy">tf.distribute.Strategy</a> to parallelize the training, but some bug stopped it from working.  Another user’s attempted workaround resulted in my model failing with an out of memory error.  More importantly, EfficientDet was originally designed for TPUs and had some bug that caused much more memory usage on GPU.  On TPUs, the largest model could be run with a batchsize of 4 per 16 gb node.  On GPUs even with a batchsize of 1, the medium model couldn’t be trained.</p>

<p>At this point, the leaderboard had not only the Waymo dummy entries at 20% AP, but also some competitive scores at ~60% AP.  It seemed like I might be able to finetune a larger EfficientDet to beat the dummy entry scores, but I couldn’t possibly put together a really competitive score.</p>

<h2 id="yolov4">YOLOv4</h2>

<p>Fortunately, at this point the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf">YOLOv4 paper</a> came out.  It promised better performance than EfficientDet and emphasized that it was trainable on commodity hardware.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, YOLOv4 isn’t implemented in a standard framework like Tensorflow or Pytorch, it’s implemented in a custom framework called <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet">DarkNet</a>.  Getting it working required learning about CMake and Make, fixing a bug that prevented it from compiling with half-precision support and painfully learning that Make doesn’t natively take advantage of multi-core support.  It also takes in data as individual files, not optimized formats like tfrecord.  I was forced to move my data to my SSD to get full performance.</p>

<p>With all the setup difficulties sorted, I was able to train a YOLOv4 network with the recommended setup up.  I trained for several days and got a network with a performance of 34%!  That was much better than the 13% I’d gotten with EfficientDet.  Unfortunately, the default number that YOLO reports is the AP50 number, a less stringent test than the AP number that EfficientDet uses.  EfficientDet also reports the AP50 number, so I was able to guesstimate that my 34% would give me a true AP of around 20%.  That was maybe high enough to beat Waymo’s dummy entries, but nowhere near high enough to be competitive.</p>

<p>However, at this point, I was basically out of ideas for how to get a truly competitive score.  Since the ~20% AP was the highest number I had yet gotten, I put together the code necessary to turn the YOLO predictions into the Waymo format and uploaded my validation predictions.  <strong>Their system informed me that I had a score of 44%!</strong></p>

<h2 id="back-to-efficientdet">Back to EfficientDet</h2>

<p>At this point, I knew that my pessimism about the performance of my models was wrong - the Waymo metric was way more forgiving than either of the metrics I’d been paying attention to.  Now the job was to build on the models I had in order to beat the fore-runners.  Of …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decision seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you think they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly and succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

<p>Dopamine. Ah, the rush.</p>

<p>The endless possibilities of what this latest project can become. It’s not like all the others. It won’t end up in the old car graveyard like the rest.</p>

<p>A million dollars. Someone could eventually buy it for that much. Wait, a billion sounds way better. The amount of people that can be managed, mentored, all on this rocket ship. This side thing will help the world, make it a <strong>better place</strong>. This company will be different, we’ll even <em>think different</em>. Fridays will be off and everyone will be happy.</p>

<p>I wonder where we should put the campus. I like the idea of everyone being remote, but an office in the early days could make the innovation happen faster.</p>

<p>Wait, I need a name. No vowels, .io for sure. Something totally independent of the service we provide. I don’t want to be the next 24 Hour Fitness. Something like Lime, or Uber, or Zoom. It’s gotta be one syllable, easy to spell, easy to say. But I need to be able to have a good domain name. Nothing like justuse[name]co.io.</p>

<p><em>*Slack notification from 9-5*</em></p>

<p>I need to make sure that this project can scale. Am I picking the right language and framework? I’ve learned by doing, so I can pick a new one. But I’ve heard that when you’re serious, you should stick to something you already know so you can focus on the product. Yes, I’m definitely serious.</p>

<p><em>*Slack notification from 9-5*</em></p>

<p>Ok, looks like I’ll continue tomorrow. Wow, I made a lot of progress. This definitely won’t end up like the others.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<p>Find below the details of the hardware used:</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Applying to startups, medium-big corps is a tedious task. The standard is to apply to 100+ companies and prepare 100+ programming problems. Does it have to be this hard? Short answer no. In fact, I applied to 30 companies and landed 25 interviews. And the good news is, it generally doesn’t take more than 2 weeks to finish with all that interview process (of course it depends on the company)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s get started already. If you are applying to:</span></p>

<h4><span>Startup/Medium-Size Company:</span></h4>
<p><span>The hiring process depends on the company. More often than not, you talk to the CEO/CTO and are judged over your “compatibility” with the workplace’s culture. Generally, the first interview is just to get to know you, your rate (please don’t ask for a crazy salary if you are just starting out), and what you can bring to the ecosystem. At later stages, you are assigned a take-home project or a live coding interview.</span></p>
<p><span>Your responsibility depends on how much funding the startup has and its burn rate. The lesser the investment, the more critical your responsibility. It makes sense because the founder(s) can’t hire another developer to help you out. And you probably have been hired because you’re full-stack. You are also expected to have an “entrepreneurial mindset”, you get the chance to make influential decisions. It’s important to know that you aren’t a “code monkey”.You’ll need to make well-thought decisions for the sake of the startup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>To land an interview, your best bet is to reach out to the founders: </b><span>Skip sending your application through the website. Instead, craft your best looking, most personal, and professional email out there. You research the startup, research the founders, and link what they work on to your skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Be careful of sounding too general “I’m interested in your company, it’s truly something the world needs”; Say what is special about it, if you have a question or 2, you can include them. But the main purpose is to show your interest.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span>Include your resume and make sure it’s clean and spacious enough. No one wants to read a 2-page resume full of little details. The most important on the top, and shoot your shot, no time to waste.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span>Include a call to action at the end of your email “Would love to hear from you.”&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span>You are set! You’ll be amazed by the response rate. And the founders are friendlier than you might think.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>To find startups that match your profile, you can use: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://angel.co/"><span>angel.co</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.workatastartup.com/"><span>workatastartup.com</span></a></p>



<h4><span>Big tech</span></h4>
<p><span>This one is tricky. The application portals are heavily advertised and probably everyone applies through them. Result? Your application goes unnoticed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I won’t beat around the bush, you need a recommendation. Unless you are some high profile employee at company X, you won’t be noticed. Most people I know got in with a recommendation. This legacy system puts other applicants at a disadvantage in the resume screening process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But how can you get a recommendation? </span><span>So far there are 2 ways.</span></p>

<p><strong>Your circle/network</strong></p>
<p><span>Start by asking people in your circle. Note that a recommendation helps you with skipping the screening process and that’s it. The rest is on you. Being hired totally depends on your skills from this point forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>Create a relationship</strong></p>
<p><span>If you are applying to big corp XYZ, chances are you’re really interested in the company culture (salary aside). You can go on LinkedIn and connect with an employee from that company. Ideally, you want to stay in touch for months to come. A great way to do so is by asking questions!&nbsp; When you build this long term relationship, you can ask for a recommendation. Obviously, you don’t want to talk to employees just because of the recommendation, be authentic!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This brings it to the end of this article. If you learned something new or want to connect shoot me an email 🙂 Until next time. Take care!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-20038">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>The New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/10/can-we-have-prosperity-without-growth">asks</a> if it is possible to have prosperity without growth. My answer is an emphatic yes. </p>
<p>When pundits talk about slowing growth and stagnation, the are usually alluding to declining real US GDP growth, relative to the past:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Quarterly_gross_domestic_product.png/1920px-Quarterly_gross_domestic_product.png"></p>
<p>Real GDP growth is around 2-3%/year, which is half it was 2-4 decades ago.</p>
<p>But does this mean less prosperity? The evidence shows the opposite, that prosperity has surged in spite of slowing growth.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>The 2009-2020 bull market is the longest and biggest ever on an inflation-adjusted basis. Trillion dollars of wealth has been created since 2009.</p>
<p>Supposed stagnation hasn’t stopped Tesla from surging above $700, a gain of 3000% since its IPO in 2010. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, billions of dollars wealth has been created in tech start-ups such as Uber, AirBNB, Dropbox, Snapchat, etc. One can argue that this is paper wealth and not ‘real’ wealth, but insiders and other shareholders are able to sell on the secondary market, so it’s not like this equity cannot be converted into cash. </p>
<p>The Nasdaq is up 400% since 2010, almost a bigger gain than even the ’90s.</p>
<p>In spite of low GDP growth, US real GDP growth still exceeds many large and developing economies such as Brazil, Spain, Turkey, UK, Italy, Germany, Japan, etc. Even though Brazil and Turkey have higher nominal GDP growth, inflation is so high and the US dollar is so strong that real GDP growth is worse than that of the US. </p>
<p>Home prices have recovered all their 2005-2008 losses and are making new highs in many regions such as the Bay Area. Many pundits predicted that home prices would take decades to recover, if ever, but it only took 5 years to make new highs, enriching landlords and homeowners:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.dqydj.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/median-home-price-1.png"></p>
<p>The Forbes 30 list is much wealthier now than ever before, and over the past decade their wealth has grown considerably on a real basis thanks to rapidly appreciating share prices such as tech stocks. </p>
<p>Why have stocks done so well? The answer is strong earnings growth and fat profits. Historically speaking, corporate profits are very high to GDP:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/2/saupload_Profits_2B_2525_2Bof_2BGDP.jpg"><src></src></p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/disagreeing-with-tyler-cowen-about-stagnation/">Disagreeing with Tyler Cowen about Stagnation and Innovation</a>, it’s possible to have huge real returns in the market in spite of low GDP growth. If large cap corporations are generating profit margins of 10-30% (especially for large cap tech such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Apple), then investors stand to make a real return in excess of 8-28% whether in the form of dividends or share price appreciation (such as from buybacks or increased shareholder equity). This is how it’s possible for stocks to surge 10-30% every year even if GDP is only around 2-3%/year. </p>
<p>Shareholders seen their wealth surge since 2010. Defense companies, tech companies are generating hundreds of billions of dollars in free cash flow every quarter, the highest ever. The US govt. can borrow at just 2%/year for 10 years, and that money flows into the private sector and S&amp;P 500 stocks, which generate profit margins as high as 30%. This represents a significant real return for investors even if the national debt keeps rising. This is also why investors should not worry about the national debt. The S&amp;P 500 gained 30% in 2019 in spite the national debt rising to as high as $23 trillion and GDP growth only being only 2.5%, representing a real return of 28% for investors, which is huge. It also helps that the US dollar is also very strong. This means Americans are becoming not only nominally more wealthy but also wealthier relative to the rest of the world. As discussed <a href="http://greyenlightenment.com/economic-myths-part-1-budget-surpluses-are-good/">here</a>, the fears over the national debt are overblown and the interest paid on debt relative to GDP is the lowest in decades. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.redd.it/xpcizwgfra401.png"></p>
<p>Moreover, inflation is stubbornly low at just 2%/year in spite of large deficits and failed media predictions of how the Trump tariffs would cause high inflation, so this means a greater real return too both for stocks and real estate. This is also good for consumers and low inflation generally means a higher standard of living because purchasing power is higher; however, as many will point out, healthcare and college inflation is far higher than the CPI. But in regard to the latter, college grads have seen their wages rise on a real basis, especially since 2009, so this sorta helps cancel it out. </p>
<p>The US economy is being increasingly dominated by large companies that are able to generate large, reliable recurring revenues, protected by networking effects and intellectual property, such as Disney, Microsoft, and Facebook. Microsoft can keep selling the same version of Windows and Office over and over, with some small improvements every couple years. Facebook and Google have thousands of clients that they bill on a recurring basis for advertising, generating profit margins as high as 30%. </p>
<p>In spite of stagnant real wages for many middle and low-class jobs and high student loan debt, tons of people are making money in option trading, selling on Amazon, coding, social media, etc. 15 years ago these industries either didn’t exist or were in their infancy, such as Amazon’s third-party seller program. IQ matters a lot too. People who make a lot of money tend to be smarter than the general population, such as doctors, stock traders, or software developers. Doctor and lawyers go into a lot of debt early in their careers, but make it up with huge salaries, that grow on a real basis. A car salesman may make $200k but these tend to be huge outliers. The median tech worker does better than the median car salesman. However, those who are less intelligent have fared more poorly since 2010, and some have seen their wages stagnate on a real basis. </p>
<p>From <a href="http://greyenlightenment.com/18789/">The ’90s and now, part 14</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
On the flip side, although the past decade has been great for the investing class and tech class, perhaps the ’90s were better for the working and average-IQ class. Not everyone can be a millionaire or billionaire tech company founder, a Bain or McKinsey consultant, a YouTube or Instagram superstar, a software developer, an investment banker, or a cryptocurrency or option trading whiz. People of average IQ and ability are possibly falling between the cracks, unable to participate in the otherwise strong tech-and-finance-driven economy. There’s tons of wealth being created, but much of it it seems concentrated in the hands of a few. This is why there is the juxtaposition of today’s competitive economy with the acceptance or reconciliation of mediocrity, whether it’s popular subs such as /r/aftergifted or massively up-vpoted memes on /r/funny, the shared narrative being coping with failing to meet the high expectations America’s increasingly competitive, credential-driven economy and society imposes, where so many people are striving to get into top tech firms and top universities.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Shareholders are the biggest beneficiaries of this trend and have seen their wealth surge in recent decades on a real basis in spite of slow GDP growth. But unlike the top 10%, the poor and middle class are less likely to own stocks and have less of their net worth tied in equities. So for the wealthy and successful, things may seem prosperous, but for everyone else, maybe less so. </p>

<h4>A company with a 100 CEOs can do anything.</h4>
<p>Amazon appears to be a unique success when it comes to not just the success it has achieved but the diversity of businesses it has succeeded in — from online retail to web services, and the march continues into many, many new lines of business.</p>
<p>Almost every large, successful company struggles with growing beyond its core business. Oracle is great at selling software, Salesforce is great at cloud CRM, Apple is great at selling devices and they do an okay to good job of selling products and services that are complimentary — often through the exact same distribution channel.</p>
<h4>The constraint is senior leadership bandwidth.</h4>
<p>If your CEO and executive leadership of the company need to be bought in before you can execute, as a business leader you have to now convince leaders who have great instincts for say a retail or ad business to grok an entirely new business model. This is not easy. Most companies fail here.</p>
<p>Google is a great example — it’s done a great job of winning the online search market and almost anything that can be monetized using the same business model — ads. But when it tries to get into new businesses like grocery delivery, selling phones (Motorola &amp; now Pixel), robots that walk, cars that drive themselves — it often appears to struggle on the goto-market and business side. Where it sets up clear business units with leaders it does well, YouTube under Susan Wojcicki being a great example.</p>
<h4 name="7d1e">What makes Amazon succeed where others struggle so&nbsp;hard?</h4>
<p>Amazon appears to be one company run well by Jeff Bezos and his direct reports like Andy Jassy — but in reality Amazon has succeeded in building a culture of 100 CEOs — it hires, grooms, develops and builds “General Managers” — there is literally over 100+ of them*.</p>
<h4>A company with a 100 CEOs can do anything.</h4>
<p>While many companies give GM like titles to their executives, they are often constrained by central planning of some sort. They pay what is known as the corporate <a data-href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-uncanny-valley-of-a-functional-organization/" href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-uncanny-valley-of-a-functional-organization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strategy tax</a>. At a company like Oracle, I couldn’t price product A if it would impact the profitability and revenue of (cash cow) product B. Every major successful company learns to protect its cash cow — and while this initially helps, often for decades, it eventually turns into a millstone around the neck of every business. Be it mainframes, databases, ERPs, ad revenue, or whatever.</p>
<figure name="b526"><img data-height="1354" data-image-id="1*uQtrDSN4gU64-spaJLGT_A.png" data-width="2546" src="https://www.anshublog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1-uQtrDSN4gU64-spaJLGT_A.png"><figcaption>100 Mini-Me&nbsp;CEOs</figcaption></figure>
<p>(Technically speaking, the titles at Amazon are a little mixed. Not all GM’s lead businesses but many do — from Alexa to Redshift Analytics. But the business is structured around these BU leads some run all of India while some are growing new businesses like “live video”.)</p>
<h4 name="f879">Why can’t every company declare 100&nbsp;CEOs?</h4>
<p>Companies often talk about agility and the desire to move faster and move decision making to the edge but they are not truly built for it.</p>
<h4>Amazon was built ground up on APIs and Categories</h4>
<p>Amazon’s first foray into books meant when it entered new categories, it appointed GMs for new categories who ran them as businesses. Pretty close to how a brand manager at P&amp;G can make decisions around Tide.</p>
<p>But it was the key technological architectural decision of being API driven for every single (micro) service in the company that truly enabled <strong>Amazon to be a network of business units — </strong>interacting and doing business with each other with clear APIs and rules of engagement.</p>
<p>Companies like Google realize this and hence the move to Alphabet, and appointing a clear CEO of Google Cloud (Diane Greene) but its hard to retrofit this model unless you have practiced it and its deeply ingrained in your culture.</p>
<p>In some ways, GE was the original conglomerate with many businesses operating under leaders but they are big businesses.</p>
<blockquote name="100f"><p>Amazon grows BU’s that look like startups from $0 to $100M and sometimes to $1B+ under GM’s that literally start out with nothing more than an idea. Amazon’s database business is one such example.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Amazon, welcomes its one more CEO — Mackey of Whole Foods, its good to remember that he joins a long list of executives at Amazon running billion dollar businesses, and there will be more grown internally, and acquired.</p>

<h3>I made a macro keypad with 3d-printed switches</h3>
<p><i>Mon  6 July 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/electronics.html">electronics</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/3dprinting.html">3dprinting</a></i></p>
<p>Latest on the 3d-printed keyboard switch project: I've reached a switch design that I think is probably reliable enough,
and I've put 3 of them together to form a macro keypad just to see how it all goes together before I commit to a
full keyboard. I don't have a number for how many presses the switch lasts, other than to say that
the motor on the testing machine stopped working before the switch did (after about 250,000 presses).</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2745"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2745"></a></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHkOPBxnLtM">watch my short demo video</a> if you want.</p>
<p>"80%" and "60%" keyboard layouts are quite popular, which are correspondingly reduced versions of a full keyboard layout.
I like to think of this keypad as a "3%" keyboard, it's fine as long as you only want to type "jes".</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2746"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2746"></a></p>
<p>It's controlled by an Arduino Pro Micro. It's hard to tell from the pic because of the hot glue, but the switches are wired up to pins 2, 3, and 4, from
the other side of the board.</p>
<p>For the software side of it, I used the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/">Arduino Keyboard library</a>,
using <a href="https://gist.github.com/jes/fe1aeb18457a06562516372684d1bd47">this quick and dirty Arduino code</a>.
Approximately all of the code is just related to the debounce logic.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2748"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2748"></a></p>
<p>The switches are printed in some generic no-name clear PETG.
The case and keycaps are printed in <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/711-prusament-pla-prusa-galaxy-black-1kg.html">Prusament Galaxy Black PLA</a>.
I'm a big fan of this filament. The glittery effect means the layer lines almost completely disappear. It's basically the same effect you get when printing with
carbon fibre-filled nylon, but with none of the difficulties of printing carbon fibre-filled nylon.</p>
<p>All of these parts, including the switches, were printed on my new <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mini/">Prusa Mini</a> printer, which arrived last week and I'm very pleased
with so far.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p>The problem with the switch design <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-update.html">from last time</a> was that the copper tape was splitting apart, which prevents it from conducting along
its full length. I initially thought I had
solved this by applying a 2nd layer of copper tape, but that turned out not to be a workable solution. I did a bunch of tests of various combinations of 50% and 75% activation position, and 1 or 2 layers of copper
tape, and found no significant correlation between either of those 2 variables and how long the switch lasts. The switches lasted between 225 presses and 330,000 presses before
failure. 7 failed by the copper tape splitting, 2 failed by the PETG spiral spring breaking (both after more than 200,000 presses), and 1 didn't seem to have any broken parts, it just wasn't reliably working any more.</p>
<p>This is the CAD model of the latest design:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2749"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2749"></a></p>
<p>The "leaf spring" has that funny shape in its bend so that it can tilt easily, which ensures that it makes reliable contact with <i>both</i> contact wires, instead of
just the first one it happens to touch.</p>
<p>And here's a slow-motion video showing how it works (a slightly earlier iteration, but the same concept):</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/peXFqVMugO4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Also, just for fun, I did some <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/freecad-fea.html">FEA</a> on the spiral spring
design, and it behaved just like the real version:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2724"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2724"></a></p>
<p>The red areas show the areas of highest stress, and indeed the springs tend to break around
the middle of the spiral.</p>
<h2>Print your own</h2>
<p>I consider this a "release candidate" rather than a finished design, because there is still
some work to do on it (in particular, I want to make it a bit less tall). But you can have it if you want it.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>FDM 3D printer (although I'd also be interested to see results from resin printers!)</li>
<li>PETG filament. You can try other materials. PLA works but makes for a heavier feel and breaks more quickly.</li>
<li>1.0 mm diameter copper wire, 90 mm length per switch should be more than enough</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/3dpswitch-rc1.tar.gz">Download the STL files</a> and arrange them on the build plate something like this (you'll probably have to rotate the spiral spring):</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2750"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2750"></a></p>
<p>I suggest printing more than 1 of the "leafspring" part as it is a small part quite likely to
have defects in the print. Make sure you're printing at
a fine enough quality level to include all the features. In particular, make sure (both) the spirals on
the spring are connected all the way around, and that the leaf spring is connected all the way
along. I use the "0.15mm QUALITY" setting in PrusaSlicer. You shouldn't need any support material.
You might need to enable "detect thin walls".</p>
<p>You might need to add up to -0.3mm of X/Y size compensation. I have found that when printing
this on the Prusa Mini, optimal clearance is achieved when the 3.0 mm plunger rides inside
a 3.0 mm hole. On previous printers I've owned, this wouldn't even fit together. I'm not sure
what's going on, but obviously I modeled it to print on my machine, so you might need to apply X/Y
compensation on yours.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Print the parts. It takes about 40 minutes for me.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Clean up any stringing inside the case from the PETG. I use a lighter to burn off the worst of it,
and then a Stanley knife to trim off what remains.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Examine the spiral spring and ensure that it moves freely. You might need to cut any
stringing between the spirals with a knife, or re-print with different X/Y compensation, depending on whether it is a few small
tight spots or bad clearance all the way along.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Slide the spiral spring into the shelf at the top of the case. The orientation is not
critical, I tend to slide it in with the smoothest sides against the case just to make life easy
for myself.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b> Push the plunger through the top hole in the case, through the hole in the spiral
spring, and through the middle hole in the case. Verify that it moves up and down freely and that
the spring reliably returns it to the top. If not, take it back out and trim the tight spots with
a knife.</p>
<p><b>Step 6:</b> Cut off about a 13mm length of the copper wire. Slide it into the hole in the
leaf spring. If you can't get it through, you might need to widen the hole with a pin or sharp tool of
some kind. Use whatever you have.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:</b> Press the plunger down slightly to expose the attachment end inside the lower
chamber of the switch. Using a small pair of pliers or tweezers, push the attachment part of the
leaf spring onto the end of the plunger. Make sure it is pushed home. Looking in the big hole
at the bottom of the case, you should see the leaf spring roughly centred. When you let go
of the plunger, the spiral spring should still be stretched out slightly. This is desired, without
this preload the switch would start moving at 0 force.</p>
<p><b>Step 8:</b> Cut off 2x roughly 35mm lengths of copper wire. Using a pair of pliers, put a bend about
5mm from
one end. Insert the non-bent end through 1 of the wire holes and out the other side. Bend the wire
down the other side, and then in whatever direction you want your contacts to point. Repeat for
the second wire.</p>
<p>You should now have something that looks a bit like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2752"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2752"></a></p>
<p>And that should be it! Manually press the switch a few times and visually verify that the middle
copper wire appears to be making good contact with the other 2 wires, and then you're ready to
assemble it into a circuit! If you want it mechanically attached to a PCB, you could leave a longer
length of wire coming out of the first side, and you'd then have 4 soldering points. Otherwise,
mount it inside a 14mm square hole. You'll probably need cut-outs in the corners to accommodate
the wires sticking out, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2753"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2753"></a></p>
<p>If you make one (or more!) I'd be really interested to hear your opinion on what could be designed
better, and to see pictures of your results. Email me: <a href="mailto:james@incoherency.co.uk">james@incoherency.co.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>We're getting pretty close to being able to put together a finished keyboard. I still
have the following things to do:</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>It would be good to get an accurate value for the number of presses that the switches can take. I
think currently a lot of the variability comes from the height at which the switch is positioned
relative to the tester. If it's doing 0.1mm short of a full stroke, the switch is likely to last
significantly longer than if it is being hammered 0.1mm longer than a full stroke. This is hard to
configure as I have only very coarse control of the height.</p>
<p>I watched the Linus Tech Tips tours of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1gP4PfqCQ">the
Cherry MX factory</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fNiJKh6q-E">the Omron factory</a>. They're both interesting and worth watching. I took a screenshot of this testing machine in the
Omron video:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2712"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2712"></a></p>
<p>So there we have a single motor raising a platform up and down which is pressing 10 switches
at once. The platform glides on a pair of linear rails, and the exact vertical position of the press
is finely adjusted with a separate screw for each switch. The moving platform also has
a spring at each end, I am not completely sure why, I think just to take up some of its weight, to
reduce the load on the motor.</p>
<p>But this is a much better way to gang-test switches than what I have at the moment, which involves
wiring up a separate motor for each switch and gets messy quickly:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2755"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2755"></a></p>
<p>I'm past the point where more testing is critical (famous last words, I know), but it would be good
to do anyway, so I'd like to make a small-scale copy of the Omron testing machine.</p>
<h3>Switches</h3>
<p>The switch fits in a 14mm square hole (apart from the protruding wires), which is the same size
as a Cherry MX switch, but the total height from the bottom of the switch to the top of the keycap
is almost twice as large, about 45 mm vs 25 mm:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"></a></p>
<p>This directly translates to increased keyboard height, so it would be good to cut this down
as much as possible. I should be able to lose 2 mm from the wire support at the bottom of the switch,
and another 1 or 2 mm in the height of the leaf spring attachment, but there's no way it's going to be
as thin as the Cherry MX.</p>
<p>I'd like to find a way to add a tactile bump (ideally with a clicky noise) to the motion of
the plunger. I did try simply adding a bump to the side of the casing that would catch on the
leaf spring, but it didn't work very reliably.</p>
<h3>Keycaps</h3>
<p>Currently my keycaps are based on the one I designed in <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/cad-dojo/stories/keycap.html">my
CAD Dojo project</a>. This is suboptimal for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>adding text in FreeCAD is extremely time-consuming, and it can't be edited without deleting it …</li></ol></div></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>
</p>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

<p><img src="https://www.andrewdenty.com/blog/assets/img/catalina-vs-big-sur.jpg" alt="Catalina vs Big Sur">
This post is an attempt to provide a visual comparison of pretty dramatic UI changes between macOS Catalina and Big Sur.</p>
<p>Why did I end up doing this? Well, this week I installed the developer beta of macOS Big Sur as I was curious what impact the new UI would have on the <a href="https://www.andrewdenty.com/airtame-desktop-app.html">app I currently design</a>. I wanted to make sure my team was ahead of any coming changes as we were burned by changes in last year’s release of Catalina.</p>
<p>I found myself taking lots of screenshots to try and track the changes and thought this might be worth sharing. I decided to carry out a quick catalogue of the UI changes as this may be helpful to other people getting ready for macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>All of the screenshots below are taken on a default install of macOS and the Catalina version is always on the left. I made a conscious effort not to resize any windows or change any default settings. I haven’t captured everything, but it is a good taste of the changes so far.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>


<p>At first glance macOS is a lot more colourful with, and the biggest obvious change is the bright, slightly more cartoonish iOS shaped icons. Everything is more rounded and it feels like everything has gotten a little bigger. Could this be the first hint that macOS is preparing for touch support in the future? One interesting tidbit, is that even though the icons are based around the capsule shape, many of them (like Contacts, or Preview) have elements which protrude from them giving an extra feeling of depth.</p>
<h2 id="finder-and-preview">Finder and Preview</h2>
<p>Finder sees some significant changes. Of all the places I think Apple needs to get the new UI spot on, is Finder. Overall the default size of Finder seems to be bigger in macOS Big Sur.</p>


<p>One thing that struck me at this point is that Finder looks a mess with many of the more advanced features enabled. The bottom screenshot shows Finder with a Path Bar, Status Bar and multiple tabs. To me, it seems like the design team have not yet been able to find a way to elegantly integrate these elements into the iOS inspired UI.</p>
<p>One final thing to note is that in Finder the search bar at the top right has been replaced with a search icon that expands when clicked. This change seems a little inconsistent as it’s not made it to Preview. I can guarantee this will result in fewer people discovering Finder’s Spotlight search goodness.</p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences sees quite a lot of change in some areas.
The Dock preferences pane has become “Dock and Menu Bar” and now integrates controls for the new macOS control center. It uses a nicely integrated sidebar to manage different categories.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that this sidebar hasn’t yet made it to other parts of the preferences UI with Network and Notifications still using a very old looking sidebar.</p>
<p>One aspect of preferences that has been quite controversial (on Twitter at least) is the new icons. I’m going to hold off judgement for now as they don’t yet look finished. For example, the Notifications icon does not even support retina displays.</p>


<p>You’ll notice that the Startup Disk pane uses apples new dialog box UI. This is quite a departure from the existing drop-down - it feels much more iOS-like.</p>
<h2 id="menu-bar-and-notification-center">Menu Bar and Notification Center</h2>
<p>This is one of the areas where macOS has changed the most. It’s also difficult to take decent screenshots of both of these. Control Center looks like it’s been badly photocopied and the Notification Center in Catalina has a bug whereby it renders at double it’s normal width.</p>
<p>What was obvious within a few minutes of use was that the Control Center is a massive improvement on Catalina’s row of scattered Menu bar icons. The updated WiFi menu is also a massive improvement, as the old list could easily be overwhelming with the number of WiFi networks displayed.</p>
<p>I’m less convinced that the Notification Center is easier to use though. Now it has no background, there is less to separate a list of notifications from my messy desktop!</p>
<p>I will try and get better screenshots for this section and update it in the near future.</p>


<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2>





<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>


<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The biggest news in Notes is that after years, the Skeuomorphic paper texture has finally been retired!</p>


<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>


<h2 id="apple-music-and-podcasts">Apple Music and Podcasts</h2>
<p>Music and Podcasts were brand new last year with the release of Catalina. It’s obvious that the new UI has been planned for a while as Apple Music and Podcasts are mostly indistinguishable from their initial Catalina release. For example both apps already include the new full height sidebar.</p>
<p>For me this illustrates a bigger point that <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1275311056672325633" target="_blank">Steven Sinofsky recently made on Twitter</a> - that Apple is executing a meticulous multi-year strategy.</p>


<p>One area where changes are evident are is in preferences windows. Both apps make use of Apple’s new accent colour and new glyph icon library.</p>
<h2 id="other-bundled-apps">Other bundled apps</h2>
<p>It was impossible to go into depth with every single bundled app. On the whole, the updates to Maps, Books and Mail all look solid with extensive use of the new sidebar.</p>


<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>Both Activity Monitor and Disk Utility have received a new style toolbar. As with Finder, there are no longer any rows meaning all elements are at the same level. On first impressions, I feel this is a little visually confusing and makes it harder to scan. The search field also loses a lot of its contrast.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Terminal is almost unchanged.</p>



<h2 id="almost-unchanged">Almost unchanged</h2>
<p>On the subject of unchanged apps, there were a number of other apps that are so far relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>Siri in macOS Big Sur shows no apparent changes. I think this is a little strange considering the overhaul Siri is receiving in iOS 14. There don’t even seem to be any radius changes to the borders.</p>
<p>The most extreme case of no change is Stickies. It’s completely identical between both releases. What’s more, I don’t think it’s changed much since MacOS 9 judging from its weird, retro controls.</p>


<p>Boot Camp is also practically unchanged, although this is perhaps unsurprising given Apple’s move to Apple Silicon, so presumably Boot Camp’s days are numbered. It did receive a new icon though.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, the UI changes in macOS aren’t as dramatic as I was expecting. Big Sur’s new UI feels like a largely incremental set of changes to make macOS feel more coherent with iOS and iPad OS. Even if there are a few teething issues and the look is a little jarring at first, this has to be a good thing in the long-term.</p>
<p>Having said that, Apple still has a vast amount of work to do to perfect the new macOS UI. It unsurprising as this is the first developer beta, but there are still many rough edges.</p>
<p>I hope in the long term they focus on creating consistent patterns: for example for the first launch experience of apps. Right now there are several different layouts and approaches to this UI. I also hope Apple don’t leave pro users behind. Right now some of the less frequently used UI elements such as status bars and path bars look a little unloved. They don’t feel well integrated into the UI and in some cases lack visual separation.</p>

                        It sounds simple, yet, it's challenging.<br>
<b>"Build to learn."</b><br>
It's a fantastic tool for chaotic minds.<br>
A way to benefit from your shortcomings.<br>
If you ever fell for the shiny object syndrome (chasing new cool thing, instead of focusing on the present project), then this is for you!
And the best part - you can turn it to your advantage!<br>
Turn it to build momentum, to become a better, wiser, fuller person.</p><p>

When you fell for the shiny, new, better idea, you could've gone through the guilt and growing anxiety for not finishing things.<br>
For some of us, this could end up in depression or/and quitting the whole "maker" realm.<br>
In this post, I will provide you a valid solution to make the most out of the shiny object syndrome. If you have it, at least you can get something positive out of it.<br>
The method, disguised under many names, sometimes called "build to learn," "build to fail," "ship to learn," is meant to make the most of your nature of jumping between the projects.<br>
It's also a way for you to grow as a builder and founder.</p><p>

I first started flirting with the idea independently - then, I found out that there is a micro-movement of sorts doing the same.<br>
Two main places are hubs for this, New York and Silicon Valley. Only there you could try to hack success and look for possible anomalies to benefit from, and still get support from your social circles!<br>
It's evident that financial capital (New York) is much less flexible about it (cross the border and you are gone) than Silicon Valley (cross the border, let's hire him, he might know something we don't).<br>
And then, culture and social conveniences are limiting this movement elsewhere, causing people to quit.<br>
Sadly - if you are from outside of those areas - how can you explain to people around that success is not your goal, and failure is acceptable?<br>
It's easy to treat people trying this method like fakes or daydreamers.<br>
When you go to college and spend 3-5 years learning, then you are a smart person.<br>
If you do the same, but in real life, you might be seen as an outsider.</p><p>

Let's get to the point, though!<br>
The idea is quite simple but might be tricky to pull it off.<br>
It's based on you abandoning the goal of achieving success while focusing on educational aspects.<br>
To create projects that you will stretch and experiment to gain knowledge with a slight chance of success.<br>
So next time you see great opportunity, instead of wondering how you can ride it to the top, wonder what you can get out of it short term.<br>
Will it give you more knowledge?<br>
If so, then how?<br>
Is it worth "educational" wise?<br>
Will you learn new tech/marketing/business knowledge that would be difficult to obtain otherwise?</p><p>

The worst part of working on a project and then quitting it is to get nothing from it.<br>
Sure, we can read a lot of post-mortems, but many say the same things. They ignore the whole process and often end up in a cliche, like "a startup doing exactly this opened at the same time."<br>
And how can you learn from reading the same things over and over?<br>
Going through the process while closely observing everything that happens is key to extensive experience.<br>
Practical knowledge always beats the theoretical.</p><p>

"Build to learn" is about being practical - using theory as a ground, and then build using practical knowledge.<br>
But instead of building a castle, or a palace, we create a set of small constructions first to learn the basics.<br>
Once we can handle the basics, we move to more advanced stuff.<br>
Sooner or later, we will be building the mentioned castles!<br>
If you think you might end up building dozens of projects in search of your success story, you might accept that instead of lying to yourself, and get the most of it.<br>
There is nothing worst than wasting your talents on something meaningful.<br>
Try to push forward; you might finally realize what your real goal is. What's behind your deepest intentions.</p><p>

"Build to learn" is meant to fuel your creativity, not to kill it.<br>
The first step of it is to put a clear goal:<br>
"I build this to learn."<br>
Assume that trophies and achievements are secondary goals.<br>
After all, every major player like Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, or Richard Branson started with small projects (sometimes failing), then used the knowledge to build something big!</p><p>

Force yourself to break your ego-infused box and look outside of it, to see what are real reasons for you to fail. Learn and keep trying to understand the events happening around you.<br>
You might find out the shortcomings that were unnoticeable!</p><p>

With this reasoning, don't be afraid to keep trying (as long as you won't bet everything on it). Fail, embrace the knowledge you get from it, grow your own self, and be a better person.<br>
Don't fall in the trap of glorifying the failures though - praise the experience instead.<br>
Don't build another shiny project to be the next unicorn company. When you are ready to make the next big thing, you'll know it (and feel it). There will be no guessing, no wondering (at least in the way you see now). There will be calculation and logic behind it.</p><p>

<b>"Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes."</b> - Oscar Wilde.</p><p>

World culture is critical of repeatable failure, even for a good cause.<br>
Fail once - at least you tried, fail twice - you are a fool.<br>
The social pressure is probably the most challenging part of this method.<br>
If success (or at least how people perceive success) is not achieved, you will be labeled as an outsider or even a loser.<br>
Missing a common goal (becoming wealthy) is perceived as an overall failure.<br>
You cannot really translate the perception of failure to make it look normal.<br>
You risk getting your close ones to be skeptical and even cynical of your journey. In extreme cases, I know situations where close circles would turn aggressive against the "rule breaker."<br>
The more "failures" you "achieve," the more negative the overall attitude of the society around you will be.<br>
It's not an easy road, but it's fruitful, to say the least.<br>
You can achieve a level of understanding, where you will see ALL the mechanics behind the money-making machinery.</p><p>

There are some risks when doing this method (as with everything).<br>
Do it for not long enough, and you can get overconfident and biased.<br>
Do it for longer than you should, and you will need months to get out from the trap of setting yourself impossible challenges.<br>
Out of around dozens of people following this method (that I knew directly that is, I assume there are thousands globally), only a few completed it.<br>
Some of them quit due to social pressure (even from their partners). They still got something out of it, and all but one run a small business now (they are unable to scale/grow though).<br>
The rest created profitable companies, often one of the key players in their industry.<br>
From the original group, I was the one that took the longest to complete the road. This is because of the opportunity given to me. My partner was studying, so I did not need to focus on sorting our life as of yet. And I felt that I needed to learn more (programming, viral growth) and to make sure that my ego is under control. I needed more time because my whole life was bumpy, and I thought that some scars could affect my business sense.<br>
I did miss a deadline, though, where I could complete this process without the substantial side-effects.<br>
I knew from conversations with others that by doing this method for too long, you would need to unwind. I thought it would take 2-3 months, but I am in my 9th month, and I feel that I need 2-3 more. Don't get me wrong, I still make money online, but focusing on a small project that's growing slowly is critical to prepare myself mentally for starting massive projects.<br>
I am working on <b>Almost <span>Cake</span></b>, which quickly turned into my full-time job.<br>
<b>Almost <span>Cake</span></b> is a reanimation of one of my old build-to-learn projects that performed well. This is another excellent part of this method - you have a set of field-tested projects, where some might prove to be moneymakers.</p><p>

It took me a few years, and over 30 projects completed to get where I am now, but as said, I did the extreme version of it.<br>
One of the guys that now run a massive operation did 4 "build to learn" projects and spent 1,5 year before he moved ahead (he had some business background though).<br>
Another person with no business experience and with no business-oriented parents completed it with 7 projects and 3 years. He now runs a company that's one of the USA's leading players in his niche.<br>
So, it's hard to say how long you need this run, but the timeframe should not be of the importance here.<br>
The whole point of this method is to tame yourself and start getting somewhere with yourself.</p><p>

The key concerns of "build to learn" are:<br>
-Can you finish the project before you get bored of it? Don't invest in long term projects, when you have a track of abandoning them. You don't need to ship the product or make thousands of dollars. Focus on your initial goals first.<br>
-Can you determine small goals before starting to work on the product? Can you identify a few realistic things you want to get out of this project?<br>
-Will working on this project help you to move forward in a space you want to? If you will learn things you don't feel you need, then maybe it's better to focus elsewhere for now.<br>
-Do you really need to work on the project, or should you turn around and do something completely different? Something that is far beyond your comfort zone?<br>
-Do you have significant chances of achieving your goals with this project? Try not to pursue goals that you assume you will fail. You need to take care of your mental health and not put to much strain on it.</p><p>

Using the "build to learn" method should not become an excuse for you failing to ship. Either you build to learn, or you build to achieve something. You should never go in the middle of the project and say, "just kidding, I was doing it to learn."</p><p>

Sure, if you are already in the middle of the project, then change your goals. But don't do this for future …</p></div></div>

    <div><!-- Early draft reviewed by Mahmoud Hashemi -->
<p>If you are the kind of developer who prefers to work in UTC, you may have seen Python's <tt>datetime.utcnow()</tt> and <tt>datetime.utcfromtimestamp()</tt> methods and thought, "Ah, yes, this is what I should do to work in UTC!" But alas, this is <em>not</em> the best way to work with UTC datetimes. In fact I would say that it is <em>extremely</em> rare that you would want to use either of these functions. Consider the following dangerous code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>1571595618.0</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>utcfromtimestamp</span><span>(</span><span>ts</span><span>)</span>
<span>x_ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>timestamp</span><span>()</span>

<span>assert</span> <span>ts</span> <span>==</span> <span>x_ts</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>"{ts} != {x_ts}"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When executed with your system locale set to UTC, this will succeed just fine, but when executed in any locale where the offset at that particular timestamp is something <em>other</em> than 0, the assertion fails — for example when executed with an <tt>America/New_York</tt> locale, you'll get <tt>AssertionError: 1571595618.0 != 1571610018.0</tt>.</p>
<p>This is due to an unfortunate quirk of history and a subtle shift in what it means for a datetime to be naive that took place in the Python 2 to 3 transition. I imagine that these functions would not exist if the <tt>datetime</tt> library were redesigned today, but at the moment there are a mix of harmful and harmless uses of them out there, and it's not a simple matter to rip them all out. <a href="#pytz-familiar" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Rather than make you stick around for a history lesson as to why this problem exists, I'm going to spoil the ending and say that the right thing to do is to pass a UTC object to the <tt>tz</tt> parameter of <tt>now()</tt> and <tt>fromtimestamp()</tt>, respectively, to get a <em>time zone-aware</em> datetime:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>datetime</span><span>,</span> <span>timezone</span>
<span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>1571595618.0</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>fromtimestamp</span><span>(</span><span>ts</span><span>,</span> <span>tz</span><span>=</span><span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>utc</span><span>)</span>
<span>x_ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>timestamp</span><span>()</span>

<span>assert</span> <span>ts</span> <span>==</span> <span>x_ts</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>"{ts} != {x_ts}"</span>  <span># This assertion succeeds</span>
</pre></div>
<div id="naive-datetimes-as-local-time">
<h2>Naive datetimes as local time</h2>
<p>When originally conceived, naive datetimes were intended to be abstract, not representing any specific time zone, and it was up to the program to determine what they represent — this is no different from abstract numbers which can represent mass in kilograms, distance in meters or any other specific quantity according to the programmer's intention. By contrast <em>aware</em> datetimes represent a specific point in time in a specific time zone. Awareness of the datetime's time zone allows you to do things like <a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2018/02/aware-datetime-arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> and <a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2018/02/a-curious-case-datetimes.html">comparison</a> between time zones, conversion to other time zones and other operations which require a concrete datetime.</p>
<p>In Python 3, two things have changed that make <tt>utcnow</tt> unnecessary and, in fact, dangerous. The first is that a concrete time zone class, <tt>datetime.timezone</tt>, was introduced, along with a constant UTC object, <tt>datetime.timezone.utc</tt>. With this change, you now have a clear and unambiguous way to mark which of your datetimes are in UTC without bringing in third party code or implementing your own UTC class.</p>
<p>The change that made <tt>utcnow</tt> <em>dangerous</em> is that naive datetimes underwent a subtle shift in meaning: for certain operations that require interpreting a <tt>datetime</tt> as a fixed point in time, rather than throwing an error they would instead assume that the <tt>datetime</tt> represents the current system local time zone. So in Python 2, operations like <tt>astimezone()</tt> will raise an exception when called on a naive datetime:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>dateutil</span> <span>import</span> <span>tz</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2015</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>astimezone</span><span>(</span><span>tz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>)</span>
<span>Traceback</span> <span>(</span><span>most</span> <span>recent</span> <span>call</span> <span>last</span><span>):</span>
  <span>File</span> <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span>,</span> <span>line</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>in</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>module</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>ValueError</span><span>:</span> <span>astimezone</span><span>()</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>be</span> <span>applied</span> <span>to</span> <span>a</span> <span>naive</span> <span>datetime</span>
</pre></div>
<p>but in Python 3 it will use your system's locale (on my machine it's <tt>America/New_York</tt>) and convert accordingly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>dateutil</span> <span>import</span> <span>tz</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2015</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>astimezone</span><span>(</span><span>tz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>)</span>
<span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2015</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>tzutc</span><span>())</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is why the example that I started this post off with fails. The <tt>.timestamp()</tt> method gives a representation of a <em>fixed point in time</em>, not a point on the calendar; it returns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>, which is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC, and if you call it on a naive datetime, Python will assume that that datetime represents your machine's local time, even if you originally intended it to be UTC.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Even without the change in Python's model of what a naive datetime means, I would still recommend that you not use <tt>utcnow()</tt> or <tt>utcfromtimestamp()</tt> simply because it's the wrong abstraction: to do so would be to represent a concrete point in time as an <em>abstract</em> datetime. <a href="#now-concrete" id="id2">[2]</a> You know that your datetime represents UTC, and it's easy to mark that clearly in Python, so there's very little reason <em>not</em> to do it. As it says in the warning recently added to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcnow">the documentation</a>, you should prefer to use <tt>now</tt> in place of <tt>utcnow</tt> and <tt>fromtimestamp</tt> in place of <tt>utcfromtimestamp</tt>, so replace:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dt_now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>utcnow</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dt_ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>utcfromtimestamp</span><span>(</span><span>1571595618.0</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>with</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>timezone</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dt_now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>tz</span><span>=</span><span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>utc</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dt_ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>fromtimestamp</span><span>(</span><span>1571595618.0</span><span>,</span> <span>tz</span><span>=</span><span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>utc</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>or the equivalent using positional arguments.</p>
<p>One last thing to note: the reason that we cannot simply change <tt>utcnow()</tt> into an alias for <tt>now(timezone.utc)</tt> in the standard library is that would change the semantics of how those datetimes are treated by their consumers (and as such it would not be backwards-compatible). You should keep this in mind when converting over old code that uses <tt>utcnow</tt> and <tt>utcfromtimestamp</tt> — you will need to make sure that any code that consumes your datetimes is expecting an aware datetime. In my experience, this is not a high bar to clear, but you probably don't want to just do a search-and-replace on untested code before deploying to production and leaving work for the weekend.</p>

<![CDATA[Addio Redis, I'm leaving Redis Labs]]>
            </title>

<![CDATA[
Score 17 | Comments 5 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23748190">thread link</a>) | @kristoff_it
<br/>
July 6, 2020 | https://kristoff.it/blog/addio-redis/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kristoff.it/blog/addio-redis/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Thanks Antirez for the code, the Redis manifesto, and for the free karma especially.</p><div><p>Last week I resigned from my position as developer advocate at Redis Labs.</p>
<p>I’ve never talked much about Redis on this blog because I made a point of trying to write interesting posts about different topics, and also to avoid any form of conflict of interest: I didn’t want people to think this blog was being used as a marketing outlet by Redis Labs.</p>
<p>Now that I’m not with the company anymore, I’m looking forward to sharing some of my thoughts on open-source software and related topics, using the direct and energetic tone that I always employ here. </p>
<p>This was the first job I took that wasn’t strictly about programming. It taught me a lot about communication, how information flows between groups of people, and how companies try to shape that flow.</p>
<p>While Redis Labs as a company isn’t perfect — I wouldn’t have left otherwise, and it wouldn’t have hired me in the first place, as I’m not perfect either — I’m happy with my experience overall. The one regret I have is that my position was in part meant to help the community better understand Redis, and I’m leaving behind me basically the same level of confusion that was there when I joined 1.5 years ago.</p>
<p>Redis is less obvious to describe than other tools in the same space, but that alone is not enough to explain why no one seems to agree on what Redis is good at, or what even is Redis. To me, the current situation seems caused by an ongoing turf war between tech companies, starting from the direct competitors of Redis Labs, up to the Cloud giants, who see themselves as the ultimate gatekeepers of modern software architecture.</p>
<p>Each of these factions wants Redis to be a different thing, and so they spend their budget accordingly, starting from developer advocates like me, up to de-facto astroturfers that I’ll leave unnamed. While you and I, dear reader, are surely immune to marketing and scummy tactics, those techniques do work wonders on the public, and the strength of true statements is only used as a way of making marketing spend more efficient.</p>
<p>This is where I imagined I would spell out my take on Redis, but <a href="http://antirez.com/news/133" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">now that Antirez has left the project</a>, it doesn’t matter anymore. Whatever Redis is going to be in the future, it will be shaped by sales tactics, whatever the Clouds are going to do next, and other uninspired metrics.</p>
<p>Since this is my goodbye post to Redis, let me add an over-the-top Italian skit before jumping into the lessons learned.</p>
<h2 id="if-redis-were-pasta"><a href="#if-redis-were-pasta" aria-label="if redis were pasta permalink"></a>If Redis were pasta</h2>
<p>If Redis were pasta, it would be served in a restaurant called Salvatore’s. It would be a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce and a single leaf of basil on top; basically the Italian symbol for a simple, versatile meal. </p>
<p>Big tech would be like McDonald’s and Burger King: convinced that the future of nutrition is fast-food and constantly screaming that Redis can’t be considered a real meal as it doesn’t contain any bacon: “Come eat our new burger, which now contains an extra 4th layer of meat, exquisitely designed to make it easier to digest the meal!”</p>
<p>On a table you would find Jepsen, essentially the equivalent of Yelp, ideally meant to keep restaurants honest, generally correct, but ultimately not that different from other tech companies, and thus well deserving of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDlR_ccnZww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">boogers and cum</a>.</p>
<p>Antirez, largely preferring cooking over serving, would end up selling the restaurant to the waiters, who at that point would make their priority to turn the restaurant into an Olive Garden.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned"><a href="#lessons-learned" aria-label="lessons learned permalink"></a>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>So where’s the Redis community in this story? Well, those are just the silent, mostly anonymous regulars that come, eat, and then go on with their lives. </p>
<p>It’s the people that occasionally show up on HN and point out that they’re happy with what Redis does for them, and that they rarely think about it even, as the software tends to chug along nicely. As much as I sympathize with them, the ultimate lesson I learned is that a passive community will inevitably lead to the death of a project.</p>
<p>While the “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23690123" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spontaneus software</a>” world is busy infighting, big tech is systematically strip-mining it of any value, even when 99% of the value gets lost in the process. Tech companies are willing to go to any length to capture that 1%, and over time have learned to use Free software arguments against Free software itself, to ensure nobody would stop them.</p>
<p>The future of what we call today open-source software needs to learn to be in equal parts principled and pragmatic. The principles of human spontaneity must be preserved, to ensure we don’t turn in yet another fast-food chain, but we must understand that sophisticated ethical arguments require an equally sophisticated infrastructure beneath them, as without the latter the former can’t materialize into reality.</p>
<p>We need to keep our communities as much as possible engaged and invested in the success of our projects. The flow of information must be kept open and at high pressure, to ensure that our values and goals are well-understood by the majority of the community. Failing to do that means becoming servants of large donors and opening the community to all kinds of manipulations.</p>
<p>We need to reinvent the way we approach spontaneous collaboration in software and we must understand that it’s not going to be a peaceful process. Maybe it’s my native-american blood talking, but I feel I’m ready to get up close and personal with the world I dealt with for the last 1.5 years, except this time I won’t be wearing formal attire.</p>
<p><strong>I’m joining the Zig Software Foundation as VP of Community and it’s going to be my honor and pleasure to try to make all of this a reality for at least one project.</strong> If you want to follow us on this journey, <a href="https://zig.show/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">join us Saturday 11th on Twitch for the live announcement and first fundraising</a>. It’s going to be fun and, if we hit the corresponding donation goal, I will reveal my (until now) secret recipe for a nice summer pasta. Not as simple as Salvatore’s, but pretty good nevertheless.</p>

<p>Think finance and Mr. Buffet is one of the first names that comes to mind. Warren Buffet has had humble beginnings, his life changed drastically with an impulsive takeover of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</p>



<p>If you aren’t aware of the history behind Buffet’s reasoning behind acquiring Berkshire, it is worth reading and marvelling over.</p>



<p>Over the course of next few decades, Warren Buffet went on to take the company to new highs. In 2019, the company reported having more than 817 Billion USD in assets. </p>



<p>The most surprising part for avid investors though, has been the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has north of $137 Billion in cash and cash reserves!</p>



<p>That is a lot of cash to keep in had, especially when the markets seem to be going up. Most recently in May 2020, they exited almost all their holdings in the airline industry netting them about $6 Billion.</p>



<p>Does that mean Berkshire thinks the markets are overvalues and hyped at the moment? It is not very clear.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As we were about to publish this article, we got a notification about <a href="https://eachlist.com/buffets-10-billion-bet-on-dominion-energy-inc/">Berkshire’s largest deal in 4 years – the $10 Billion bet on Dominion Energy.</a></p>

          <p>We need better languages for introductory computing. A good introductory language makes good compromises between expressiveness and performance, and between simplicity and feature-richness. Pyret is our evolving experiment in this space.</p>

          <h3 id="why-not-just-use-java-python-racket-ocaml-or-haskell">Why not just use Java, Python, Racket, OCaml, or Haskell?</h3>

          <p>One of the enduring lessons from the Racket project is that <em>no full-blown, general-purpose programming language</em> is particularly appropriate for introductory education. By the time a language grows to be useful for building large-scale systems, it tends to have accumulated too many warts, odd corners, and complex features, all of which trip up students. The <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkf-drscheme-journal/">journal paper for DrScheme</a>  (the old name for DrRacket) explains this in some detail.</p>

          <p>In that respect, the closest fellow travelers of us Pyreteers are the Racketeers (see how that works?). In fact, the first version of Pyret was merely a <code>#lang</code> in Racket. Nevertheless, Pyret represents a departure from Racket (for now and for the near future, at least) for several reasons:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>We wanted to experiment with syntax. Much as many of us love  parentheses, we fear that Racket will always bump into an acceptance  threshold due to its syntax. We’re delighted to see the growing  adoption in industry of languages like Racket and Clojure, and maybe  the days of paren-phobia are over. But academics are far more  hidebound than industrial programmers!</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>We wanted to build a really great run-time system for the Web browser. Going through Racket and  <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/yk-whalesong-racket-browser/">Whalesong</a>  proved to be a non-starter in terms of performance, and Racket has  many features that make an efficient implementation on today’s  JavaScript very hard. Building a native JavaScript implementation  was the only option we could see. Over time, as technology changes,  this could change.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Though our pedagogy draws from and is very similar to that of the  Racketeers, it also diverges in some ways, reflecting the somewhat  different backgrounds and preferences of team. Pyret embodies <em>our</em>  educational philosophy. We felt we could more easily experiment if  we had a clean-slate design than if we had to keep fitting our work  into the constraints of Racket.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Ultimately, Racket’s <code>#lang</code> facilities, though designed to create  new languages—and a great prototyping ground for Pyret—proved to not  be quite enough to support a language creation process of the scale  of Pyret; and the need for a strong Web run-time system also meant  that we did not get enough out of the Racket ecosystem.  Nevertheless, that only represents the state of systems today; if  someday the two grew closer together, many or all of us would  rejoice.</p></li></ul>

          <h3 id="will-pyret-ever-be-a-full-fledged-programming-language">Will Pyret ever be a full-fledged programming language?</h3>

          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>First of all, Pyret is much more powerful than you might realize. Pyret is already fully-fledged enough to self-host its compiler, which is a non-trivial and realistic challenge. What that means is, when you run Pyret in your browser, it loads JavaScript code that implements a Pyret-to-JavaScript compiler (i.e., it compiles the Pyret you type into JavaScript and runs it in the browser). This compiler was produced by the Pyret-to-JavaScript compiler by compiling the Pyret-to-JavaScript compiler. Take a look at the compiler’s <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/">bootstrapping phases</a> to get a sense of its sophistication.</p>

          <p>Second, underneath Pyret is a very powerful run-time system based on over a decade of research. You don’t see it as a user of the language, and that’s the point. Many other languages expose the crippling limitations of JavaScript’s run-time to users (e.g., can’t halt a long-running computation, can’t yield control to the event loop, etc.). These languages effectively let <em>the medium become part of the message</em>, whereas we believe programmers — especially early-stage student programmers — should not have to confront these complexities, which are irrelevant to (and often significantly interfere with) the material they are trying to learn. Imagine if other languages said, “We’d love to give you function calls, but your machine’s instruction set doesn’t contain them, so we can’t — sorry!” Yet they do the equivalent when it comes to giving you control over your computation on top of JavaScript. In contrast, Pyret is uncompromising.</p>

          <p>Third, if you want to teach a media-rich curriculum, you actually need a pretty full-featured language at least under the hood. For instance, Pyret’s built-in support for reactive programming requires a much more sophisticated run-time system — and corresponding language features — than one that didn’t offer this at all or just punted to JavaScript for this support. (Essentially, event-loops are first-class entities in the language.) We just haven’t emphasized these features when talking about Pyret, focusing instead on the curriculum they support.</p>

          <p>Broadly, we view <em>building an awesome teaching language</em> as a useful design discipline that necessarily entails all the features typically expected of a mature language. When building a language, you’re constantly confronted with questions: what to do next, how to do it, and whether to do it at all. Language designers therefore need a mental framework that guides their choices. For some, it might be “Build an awesome language for shared-memory concurrency!” For others it might be “Build an awesome language for writing scientific computations very, very concisely!” For us, it’s “Build an awesome teaching language!” So whenever we’re confronted with a design (or implementation) choice, we first ask how it would play out <em>in this specific context</em>. Then we ask how it would impact our long-term goal. We have yet to find actual contradictions between the two, but it’s certainly re-ordered priorities.</p>

          <h3 id="there-are-lots-of-kinds-of-education">There are lots of kinds of “education”.</h3>

          <p>That’s right. We are focused on introductory programming education at a high-school and collegiate level — what is often called “CS 1” and “CS 2” (roughly, the first year of college). Pyret is being actively <em>used</em> in everything from high-schools to upper-level collegiate courses, giving us a tight feedback loop.</p>

          <p>Of course, even in that setting there are differences of opinion about what needs to be taught. Some believe inheritance is so important it should be taught early in the first semester. We utterly reject this belief (as someone once wisely said, “object-oriented programming does not scale down”: what is the point of teaching classes and inheritance when students have not yet done anything interesting enough to encapsulate or inherit from?). Some have gone so far as to start teaching with Turing Machines. Unsurprisingly, we reject this view as well.</p>

          <p>What we do not take a dogmatic stance on is exactly how early state and types should be introduced. Pyret has the usual stateful operations. We discussed this at some length, but eventually decided an introduction to programming <em>must</em> teach state. Pyret also has optional annotations, so different instructors can, depending on their preference, introduce types at different times.</p>

          <h3 id="what-are-some-ways-the-educational-philosophy-influences-the-language">What are some ways the educational philosophy influences the language?</h3>

          <p>Pyret is driven by the <a href="http://www.htdp.org/"><em>How to Design Programs</em></a> (HtDP) philosophy of programming education; one could almost view it as a language designed to make teaching from HtDP comfortable. However, we also have our own curricular ideas that extend or run parallel to those of HtDP, which we are steadily writing up in <a href="http://papl.cs.brown.edu/"><em>Programming and Programming Languages</em></a> (PAPL). PAPL both exclusively uses Pyret and is slowly turning into a definitive book for teaching with it.</p>

          <p>Some of our central ideas include:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>Languages should offer a rich set of values. For instance, images  should be primitive values, fully supported by the environment. This  improves the teaching of several things, from image-based  composition exercises (which are often far more interesting than  composition over numbers) to animations and games.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Languages should offer syntactic support for as much as possible of  the HtDP design recipe. (Pyret does not offer explicit support for  templates, but then again we’re rethinking the pedagogy of the  template step.)</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Design recipe support includes good data definition primitives, including  the expression of invariants. Therefore, Pyret has support for refinements  (which are currently checked dynamically; a future version may add static  support, but this is not our highest priority). In particular, by allowing  algebraic datatypes to also be objects, Pyret offers significant flexibility  and expressiveness.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Students should be able to easily write examples as a precursor to  writing code. In this regard, Pyret borrows but (we believe) syntactically  improves upon Racket’s <code>check-expect</code> family of operations with <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/testing.html">examples and  testing</a>.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Students should easily be able to escalate from simple examples to  sophisticated testing, such as writing test oracles.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Equality is subtle and languages should respect its nuances.  Students must understand the meaning of equality and its  consequences, especially with regard to observations in the presence  of state. Therefore, Pyret has carefully developed  <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/equality.html">equality primitives</a>.</p></li></ul>

          <h3 id="is-pyret-also-a-research-project">Is Pyret also a research project?</h3>

          <p>Yes and no.</p>

          <p>Yes in that, broadly speaking, we view what we are doing as very much a research effort. We have specific, novel goals in mind (some of which we’ve described elsewhere in this document), and finding good solutions to achieve those goals will require innovation. This is the very essence of research. Some of that research is on the curricular side, though, and may not require any language innovation. Indeed, as much as possible we want …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

				<p>The HELP project is a non-commercial, volunteer led project to model the combined health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Founded with the understanding that a successful approach to managing the crisis required analysis that combined the health and economic impacts from the bottom up. In other words we’re a team that’s aiming to help countries find lockdown strategies that save lives and the economy, not lives or the economy.</p>

<p>The team itself has an incredibly strong background in development and data science, with members working at firms including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goldman Sachs</li>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Gusto</li>
  <li>Microsoft</li>
  <li>(plus throw in a couple founders too!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The project had a strong start with our health model (the <a href="https://blog.auquan.com/page/cvdmdl2">Auquan-SEIR model</a>) being used by the CDC as part of their ensemble models. This put the work alongside models from seasoned academics from Harvard, John Hopkins, MIT and Imperial in the UK. This provided a clear indication of the quality of work the team was able to produce and the real value that could be delivered by community efforts.</p>

<p>The next big step for the project was joining the <a href="https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context">COMO consortium</a>. The COMO consortium is a group of academics (e.g. <a href="https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/team/lisa-white">Oxford</a>, <a href="https://weillcornell.org/nathanielhupert">Cornell</a> and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keyrellous-adib/">WHO</a>) that are working to help policymakers in 47 different low and middle income countries to plan their exit strategies. Countries involved include, but are not limited to, Brazil, some US states and the <a href="http://www.emro.who.int/index.html">WHO-EMRO</a> block of countries. Together HELP and COMO have set up an economic working group combining our expertise with their WHO, and country specific, economists to deliver actionable models for countries that need the support right now.</p>

<p>In an effort for transparency, the team has decided to open source all of the code produced and provide regular updates on the <a href="https://www.help-corona.com/">website</a>. In the last couple of weeks we have released the V0 model, which uses simplified models to create a proof of concept of how the final model will work together. The overall process can be seen below:</p>

<p><img src="https://help-corona.org/images/model_example.png" alt="Model Flow Diagram"></p>

<p>To view the V0 code, see the project’s <a href="https://github.com/Auquan/help_project/">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>The team is currently working towards the next iteration of the model that will be delivered in the coming two weeks. Improvements in this version will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to apply more historical lockdown strategies</li>
  <li>The ability to use the PyRoss health model as well as the AuquanSEIR model</li>
  <li>Development work on an Agent based and a SAM based economic model</li>
  <li>Improvement of the optimisation module and movement towards using WELBYs as an objective measure</li>
</ul>

                    <p>One of the most enviable and rare traits is the ability to consistently produce work that is unique and immediately recognisable as to who made it. If you think of the people who inspire you most in the spatial community, they all probably demonstrate this trait to some degree. Not many people can claim this, and many strive to achieve it.</p><p>Craig Taylor has this trait in abundance — his approach to spatial visualisation being both unique and incredibly beautiful. His body of work is growing by the day (I'm starting to think he never sleeps), and you've probably already seen it even if you didn't realise he was behind it. He firmly stands between the two realms of art and spatial data analysis, expertly taking complex spatial data and communicating it in a way that is both beautiful and insightful.</p><p>I've been a big fan of Craig and his work for a while now — he's had a huge impact on my own work and how I want to approach spatial visualisation — so it was a delight to finally meet him in person at an event at Ordnance Survey last year. It also turns out we have a lot in common, like both living in the arse-end of nowhere in the North West of the UK.</p><p>I recently had the pleasure of interviewing him for Spatial Awareness; learning about his journey with spatial visualisation, getting insight into his work and technique, and finding out just how he manages to consistently churn out so many amazing visualisations.</p><p>So please, grab yourself a panad (Welsh slang for a cup of tea), relax and enjoy this insight into the mind and technique of Craig Taylor. I'm certain you will find it as interesting as I have.</p><hr><p><em>Do you have a burning question for Craig? Add a comment at the end of the interview.

It wasn’t until I started working with Landscape Architects that I appreciated how important design was.</p><p>Ever since that I have tried to position myself in roles that see spatial design as a must and not just a nice to have.</p><p><strong>And what was your first job in the field?</strong></p><p>GIS Technician with Mouchel Engineering in 2008, I was lucky to get a job in GIS right after my MSc in Environmental Informatics. It was a great role but a completely different ‘GIS’ to what University taught us. There was a lot of plan production, a lot of digitising and the inevitable ’CAD to GIS’ wrangling, which back in 2008 wasn’t a whole load of fun!</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Master mapman GIS weirdo</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><p><strong>So fast-forwarding to the present day. Where do you work now, and what do you do there?</strong></p><p>DataViz Design Manager at Ito World for the past 3 years. Well according to my family in a recent quiz I'm an ‘illustrator of pointless flight and commuter data’ or ‘master mapman GIS weirdo.’ There is probably a bit of truth in both but I am in charge of delivering our 3D cinematic visualisations to a variety of clients. As I mentioned earlier usually these clients have transit data they want visualising in new or exciting ways.</p><p>Recently I have been working a lot with our internal archived data at Ito World whether that is finding new ways to visualise GTFS feeds or looking at visualising our prediction systems. I am lucky it’s such a creative role and also have access to an amazing toolset developed by our CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/halbertram">Hal Bertram</a>.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s the manipulation and animation of data to create something people might not have seen before that drives me to constantly seek new ways of visualising geo data</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><p><strong>You mention that you've always been interested in the design side of cartography.</strong></p><p><strong>What are the driving factors in why you make maps? And what excites you about working with spatial visualisation?</strong></p><p>I think everyone resonates with ‘place’ in one way or another and I find visualising geography fascinating but I love it when a ‘place’ comes to life through animation.</p><p>Take airport runways for instance, visualising the plane activity throughout a day is mesmerising and deriving the patterns and digital contrails the aircraft leave is something that you can’t appreciate until you see it animated. Or bus journeys and how the daily patterns of activity can create an urban heartbeat, or maybe turning drive-time catchments into coral formations.</p><p>It’s the manipulation and animation of this data to create something people might not have seen before that drives me to constantly seek out new ways of visualising geo data.</p><p><strong>If you look back over your career so far, what would you say is your favourite piece of work? There's a lot to choose from!</strong></p><p><a href="https://mapzilla.co.uk/work/coral-cities">Coral Cities</a>! It was the first major project which I thought could be classed as art, or at least close to art! I started looking at ways of manipulating drive-time catchments into 3D geometry and eventually came up with the Coral City concept.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/267964121?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="UK Coral Cities"></iframe></figure><p>From there the project grew and grew, we created small multiple posters and visualisations which got used on huge screens at the LA Autoshow! They were featured in fast company and even made it into Andy Kirks latest edition of Data Visualisation.</p><p>It’s the only project I’ve worked on where my wife asked for a custom poster to go in the house!</p><p><strong>Your <a href="https://mapzilla.co.uk/work/plotmypaws">PlotMyPaws</a> project is definitely one of my favourites, it's both visually compelling and also a fascinating insight into the crazy world of dogs.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you plan to revisit it?</strong></p><p>I loved PlotMyPaws — it epitomised why I love working with spatial data but also the value in creating your own unique datasets. The insight that came from visualising where my dogs were running and eventually lots of other peoples dogs in my village was amazing and super interesting, even if I took the concept a bit far with 3D heatmaps and such the like!</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/289237729?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>I did begin a PlotMyPup sequel when our second puppy arrived, Toby, but I felt I was repeating a lot of what I did the first time round with a slightly bigger dog. I’d love to expand the project and get more people tracking their dogs, but it’s tricky unless people invest in trackers themselves.</p><p><strong>Your work at Ito World is always inspirational. Tell me some more about your favourite projects there.</strong></p><p>We recently delivered three data visualisations to TomTom for a number of cities showcasing their mobility products. They wanted to showcase how their data could be used to understand mobility within a city.</p><p>Each visualisation was split into three parts, a general heartbeat of traffic during the day, a comparison of traffic on a specific day with a public bank holiday and an insight into how congestion accumulates on a number of busy roads and intersections within a city.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/358101779?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="TomTom: Visualising Probe Data in Amsterdam"></iframe></figure><p>It was fascinating how detailed their GPS traces are and they were happy for us to explore a few new visualisation styles including ‘congestion explosions’ which show traffic build up on key streets.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@craig.taylor_72813/tomtom-visualising-amsterdams-heartbeat-7939e9b60d66">I wrote a blog on the evolving design</a> we iterated through throughout the project.</p><p><strong>We've seen so far that a lot of your visualisations are animated and 3D. What hardware and software do you use to create them?</strong></p><p>All of our service work at Ito World is produced using our ‘Designer’ tool, it’s built on OpenGL and it optimised for fast rendering and designing on the fly meaning we can be really flexible when it comes to clients requirements.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/334480610?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="Ito World Showreel 2019 4k"></iframe></figure><p>Outside of Ito I am a huge fan of Cinema4D and the <a href="https://cinemaplugins.com/c4d-plugins/dem-earth/">DEM Earth plugin</a> and have dabbled in Blender during my early foray into 3D. As of late I am finding myself hooked on Houdini which feels as close to our Ito tool in terms of node based workflows as anything I have used.

<p>For the past three months, I’ve been building a highly configurable, modular, hexagon-based lighting system from scratch. Here’s a demo:</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8TQva79vo88" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Here’s some of the highlights of HelioHex:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different lighting ‘modes’
    <ul>
      <li>Set the color of the whole display</li>
      <li>Set the color of individual hexagons</li>
      <li>Generate a random aesthetically-pleasing color palette</li>
      <li>Sync the color of the display to the time of the day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Spotify integration
    <ul>
      <li>Matches up the colors of each hexagon to the features of the song playing</li>
      <li>Changes depending on the emotions of the song e.g. sadder songs are more blue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adaptable web controller
    <ul>
      <li>Use any device on the network to control the device</li>
      <li>Control all the different modes and brightness of the display</li>
      <li>Shows a virtual visualization of the display</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Flexible design
    <ul>
      <li>Arrange the hexagons in whatever pattern you like - change the settings in one file and everything automatically updates</li>
      <li>Expand the structure easily if you build more hexagons</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>Late March, I realized that all my schoolwork and testing would soon be over. In an effort to avoid spending my quarantine solely indulging in video games and Netflix, I sought a project.</p>

<p>While brainstorming ideas, I came across the <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en/consumer-led-lighting/products/smarter-series/nanoleaf-light-panels-smarter-kit/">Nanoleaf Light Panels</a>, a vibrant lighting system that gamers frequently display in their rooms. I thought that I could extend the functionality of this to show lights based off events, like if I received a notification on my phone. And maybe Facebook notifications could be blue, Snapchat notifications yellow, and email notifications red. All of the pieces of this project were starting to come together until I saw the pricetag: <strong>$200</strong>.</p>

<p>Nope. No way was I gonna spend $200 on some lights. To make it worse, that was the price for nine measely panels. Don’t get me wrong - it looked impressive, just not worth a little over $20 per panel. And even if I still wanted it, the $200 set was sold out - I’d have to cough up $300 for fifteen panels instead.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest application of the Nanoleaf Light Panels is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o41emqmX6ds">Rhythm Edition</a>, which syncs your lighting system to music. Watching the demo left me… disappointed. It was highly customizable, but perhaps too customizable. I just wanted to click a button and have the lighting system sync up to all the nuances in the song - if the song was going to have the bass drop, I wanted to emphasize that and to make the lights to feel alive. Maybe I’m in the minority here, but I was pretty unsatisfied - especially considering I’d be shelling out hundreds of dollars for this.</p>

<p>Then something clicked; why don’t I just build my own system? I could customize it to my heart’s desire and I could make it for a lot cheaper than $200. I would also learn a lot from this project - it seemed perfect. And so, I set out to build my own lighting system - HelioHex.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>As should be with any project, the first step was research. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OP-oEbzB6g">This DIY video from NerdForge</a> looked very similar to what I wanted. The key features I wanted to adopt from this was the modularity, the hexagon design (because it looked really cool), and the remote controller. However, I felt the app he developed didn’t make the most of the lights - specifically, I wanted to sync up my own system with Spotify. Also, he 3D-printed the frame for the hexagons. Unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of a 3D-printer (and I couldn’t 3D-print at the library due to the lockdown). This motivated me to alternatively make a wooden frame to give off a sleek, less-manufactured look.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vGa1oAYAX8">checked out</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmheNfCnXM">many</a> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Hexagonal-Nanoleaf-LED-Light/">more</a> <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3354082">guides</a> that helped me frame my goals. Ultimately, this research helped me answer one big question: was this project attainable?</p>

<p>The answer was a confident ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯. A lot of the electronics scared me and the coding seemed decently formidable. I like challenges, though, so I went for it. Also, given that I had boatloads of free time, it seemed like I had nothing better to do.</p>

<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>

<p>The next step for me was to create a concrete vision of my desired end-result. First up were the non-negotiables - things my project HAD to have to consider it successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working lights that are easily controllable by a remote controller</li>
  <li>Seamless integration with a music app</li>
  <li>Modularity - changing the arrangement of the hexagon units should be relatively easy</li>
  <li>Self containment - each unit is independent of other units</li>
  <li>Preset lighting modes that “look nice”</li>
  <li>A clean UI for the remote controller</li>
</ul>

<p>Next up were some nice to haves - not needed, but would make me feel really accomplished</p>
<ul>
  <li>No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding">hard coding</a></li>
  <li>Anyone should be able to control the lighting system</li>
  <li>Each individual hexagon “unit” can have their color set</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these goals were scary, especially when you combine them together - having the ability to set individual hexagon colors without hardcoding while having the UI of the remote controller look clean? Yeesh.</p>

<p>The next step was materializing this vision. What helped me was using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban Board</a>. I wrote mini tasks for myself to reach different goals - divided into sections like software, hardware, and construction and prioritized by importance. A Kanban Board made this ambitious project much more digestable. It also made sure that I wouldn’t spend time on unnecessary, small fixes unless they were needed. The goal was to build the system as quickly as possible, and then go back and optimize it. Basically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development Technique</a>. Totally see how helpful it is now and why companies emphasize it so heavily.</p>

<p>I got under my goal of $200! Ended up saving about $15 for three months of my time.</p>

<p>To be fair, I did buy other materials that I never ended up using and did not account for tax. This means that the <em>actual</em> cost of this project probably was $50-$100 higher, but we’ll just say it’s under $200 because it makes me feel better.</p>

<h3 id="wooden-frames">Wooden Frames</h3>

<p>The first legitimate step in the project was to create the casing for each unit. All the guides I found used 3D printed cases, which was inaccessible for me, so I used wood. I bought a 24” by 12” wooden sheet and cut it out into rectangular pieces. I used a hexagon shape for each unit so I had to glue six of these rectangles together. I hotglued a metal hinge into the shape of a 120° angle and used that as a reference to put the rectangles together. The structural integrity of each hexagon was important so I used a trifecta of super glue, hot glue, and wood glue.</p>

<p><img src="https://vinaybhaip.com/blog/assets/images/heliohex/wooden-hexagon-construction.jpg" alt="Wooden Hexagon Construction">
<em>Wooden hexagon construction. In the foreground, wooden side pairs are joined together that will eventually form full hexagons. In the background, you see that my worktable was a messy ping-pong table.</em></p>

<p>In the above picture, you’ll notice small triangles cut out at the bottom of each plywood piece. This allows for wires to pass through connecting units. In line with my goal of modularity, this cutout was on every side so I could configure my system however I’d like. I made eight of these units, the most I could make given the length of the LED strip.</p>

<h3 id="light-diffusion">Light Diffusion</h3>

<p>The goal of this lighting system was to have each hexagon display a uniform, individual color. To achieve this uniformity, the material on top of each hexagon must evenly diffuse light from the LED strip that lines the inner perimeter of each hexagon.</p>

<p>This is where the acrylic sheet comes in. The sheet I bought is basically the same material as the light panels that covers school ceilings.</p>

<p>The problem is that acrylic is very brittle to the point that any cut I made - using scissors, a saw, even with the knife Home Depot recommended - completely fragmented the acrylic. After spending a week trying to figure it out, I decided to hold it off till I could laser cut it when the lockdown lifted.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I used a poor man’s acrylic - paper. It served its purpose for how easy it was to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://vinaybhaip.com/blog/assets/images/heliohex/paper-light.gif" alt="Paper Light">
<em>Paper hexagons put on top of each unit. The lighting is controlled by a cheap RF remote.</em></p>

<p>Although it does look pretty cool, there’s a couple of problems. First, it’s not clean. Paper doesn’t give off that professional vibe I’m striving for and if I’m spending months on this, might as well make it look good. Second, paper is really flimsy. It wouldn’t stick well with tape, and I didn’t want a permanent solution like glue because I knew I wanted to change it eventually. Lastly, it doesn’t diffuse the light THAT well; it does the job, but it’s nothing amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://vinaybhaip.com/blog/assets/images/heliohex/acrylic-sheet-light.jpg" alt="Acrylic Sheet Light">
<em>The uncut acrylic sheet on top of a lit unit.</em></p>

<p>These images don’t do justice to the acrylic sheet. It looks miles better with material that’s meant to diffuse light. Instead of waiting for a laser cutter for who knows how long, I got lucky when a friend allowed me to borrow their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_saw">hand-held circular saw</a>. The fine teeth on this allowed me to cut the acrylic with no worry.</p>

<p><img src="https://vinaybhaip.com/blog/assets/images/heliohex/acrylic-sheet-after.jpg" alt="Acrylic Sheet After">
<em>The acrylic sheet after I cut it. On the left of the sheet you can see the jaggedness resulting from my previous methods.</em></p>

<p>It turned out a success! I hotglued the cut-out acrylic pieces to the hexagons and shaved down the sharp edges.</p>

<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>

<p>This is what I was worried about the most. Despite having taken multiple classes in high school dealing with electronics, I had no idea what I was doing - evident by me <em>almost</em> setting the house on fire a few times.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-lights">Wiring Lights</h3>

<p>I cut up the light strip to put 36 LEDs in each hexagon unit. Each LED draws 50mA at full brightness, meaning for eight hexagons, I would need 14.4 …</p></div></div>

      <p>"Low floor, wide walls" is the mantra that guides the design of MIT's <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch language</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When discussing technologies to support learning and education, my mentor Seymour Papert often emphasized the importance of “low floors” and “high ceilings.” For a technology to be effective, he said, it should provide easy ways for novices to get started (low floor) but also ways for them to work on increasingly sophisticated projects over time (high ceiling).</p>
<p>For a more complete picture, we need to add an extra dimension: wide walls. It’s not enough to provide a single path from low floor to high ceiling; we need to provide wide walls so that kids can explore multiple pathways from floor to ceiling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://design.blog/2016/08/25/mitchel-resnick-designing-for-wide-walls/">Mitchel Resnick</a></p>
<p>This gives us a lens through which evaluate tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low floor: how easy is it to learn?</li>
<li>Wide walls: how inclusive is it? How many different use-cases does it serve?</li>
<li>High ceiling: does it scale with growth?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most programming tools focus exclusively on creating a high ceiling. By choosing the other two neglected dimensions, Scratch has carved out a durable niche for itself. It is widely used in intro-to-programming courses, beginner robotics, after-school classes... any place a simple but open-ended programming model is needed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Product development has a natural bias toward pushing the ceiling higher — focusing on the needs of the most valuable customer, where the highest amount of value may be extracted. This is one of the driving forces of disruption in the <span>Innovator's Dilemma</span>.</p>
<p>How can your product focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowering the floor — becoming simpler, cheaper, "good enough"</li>
<li>Widening the walls — serving an ignored audience or market</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reload</h2>



<p>Last year, I wrote a series of articles about Bitstream Autocorrelation:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://www.cycfi.com/2018/06/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-synth-tracking/">Synth Tracking</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cycfi.com/2018/04/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-bliss/">Bliss!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cycfi.com/2018/03/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-bitstream-autocorrelation/">Bitstream Autocorrelation</a></li></ol>



<p>The code has matured significantly from its inception. It is long overdue, but now, as promised, it’s time to write about the technical details.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="https://www.cycfi.com/2019/02/q-audio-dsp-library/">Q Audio DSP Library</a>&nbsp;where this is being actively developed.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: Reading up on the previous articles is a prerequisite for understanding this post.</p>



<h2>Quick Overview</h2>



<p>For those who tuned in late, Bitstream Autocorrelation, or BACF, is an accurate, extremely fast and efficient, time-domain pitch detection algorithm. BACF can be at least as accurate as any Autocorrelation based pitch detection schemes. Unlike the standard Autocorrelation function, or ACF, BACF works on zero crossings —the Bitstream, using bitwise operations. </p>



<p>BACF is extremely fast. The computation consumes an average of 50 nanoseconds per sample, on a 2016 MacBook Pro, tracking complex guitar phrases that exhibit typical playing techniques such as legato, hammer-on, pull-off, vibrato, staccato, and right-hand tapping.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Autocorrelation, also known as&nbsp;serial correlation, is the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">correlation</a><em>&nbsp;of a&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)">signal</a><em>&nbsp;with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_signal">periodic signal</a><em>&nbsp;obscured by&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)">noise</a><em>, or identifying the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental_frequency">missing fundamental frequency</a><em>&nbsp;in a signal implied by its&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonic</a><em>&nbsp;frequencies. It is often used in&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing">signal processing</a><em>&nbsp;for analyzing functions or series of values, such as&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain">time domain</a><em>&nbsp;signals. (From Wikipedia)</em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>I was not the first…</strong> Initially, I noted that “As far as I can tell, this is my invention, but please tell me if there’s something I am missing and if I’m not the first to actually do it this way”. Recently, I was informed that there exists a prior invention in the 80s for a hardware based approach. The inventor is David Warrender and here’s the patent for his invention: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4429609A/en?oq=4429609">Pitch analyzer</a>. The patent is now expired.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> While I developed the code for a very specific source input: the guitar, the algorithm is generic and can be applied to other sources. Venturing outside the guitar realm is something I am very interested in, but unfortunately I have no time for… Yet…</p>



<h2>Data Flow</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-1024x67.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-1024x67.png 1024w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-768x51.png 768w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-1536x101.png 1536w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-2048x135.png 2048w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-1200x79.png 1200w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-600x39.png 600w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-dataflow-1-300x20.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Zero Crossing</h3>



<p>A <em>zero_crossing</em> class saves zero-crossing information necessary to extract accurate timing information such as periods between pulses for performing analysis.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zero_crossing.png" alt="" width="117" height="176"><figcaption>Zero Crossing Event</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Each zero crossing pulse is saved in a ring buffer of <em>info</em> elements. Data include the maximum height of the waveform bounded by the pulse, the pulse width, as well as the leading edge and trailing edge frame positions (number of samples from the start) and y coordinates (the sample values before and after each zero crossing) of the zero crossings.</p>



<p>Sub-sample accurate period computation can be obtained using linear-interpolation of the x and y locations of each zero-crossing event. See image at the right. The two points P1 and P2 are the previous and current positions of the zero-crossing event from the raw data samples. The actual zero-crossing is the point where the dark blue line intersects the horizontal dotted line. </p>



<h3>Bitset</h3>



<p>After collecting twice the BACF <em>window’s</em> worth of zero-crossing information, where the BACF <em>window</em> size is the period of the lowest frequency we want to detect, we transfer the information to a temporary <em>bitset</em> class, which stores the zero crossing bits as 32-bit or 64-bit integers (using the native integer size of the platform). Only significant pulses —those whose pulse heights are above a certain percentage (currently 80%) of the maximum pulse height of all pulses collected, are transferred to the <em>bitset</em>. This will eliminate spurious lower-level pulses and significantly improve detection.</p>



<h3>BACF</h3>



<p>Now we compute the bitstream autocorrelation using the XOR operation. A single XOR operation works on N bits of an integer. We get a speedup factor of N (e.g. 64 for a 64 bit machine) compared to standard ACF, and moreover, integer bit operations are a lot faster than floating-point multiplications.</p>



<p>With XOR you get a one when there’s a mismatch:</p>


<p>0 ^ 0 = 0<br data-rich-text-line-break="true">0 ^ 1 = 1<br data-rich-text-line-break="true">1 ^ 0 = 1<br data-rich-text-line-break="true">1 ^ 1 = 0</p>


<p>After XOR, the number of bits (set to 1) is counted. The lower the count, the higher the periodicity. A count of zero gives perfect correlation: there is no mismatch. Modern CPUs provide operations for counting bits in an integer. These are exposed by modern C++ compilers as built-in functions (e.g. <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html">__builtin_popcountll</a>). The bit count, together with the window size, are used to provide a normalized <em>periodicity</em> value that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 signifies perfect correlation.</p>



<h3>Sub-Collector</h3>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wiki_autocorrelation.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wiki_autocorrelation.png 166w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wiki_autocorrelation-130x300.png 130w" sizes="(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px"></figure></div>



<div><div>
<p>Unlike standard autocorrelation (image at the right) where the signal window is successively shifted/delayed and correlated against the unshifted reference signal to get the peaks (or valleys, depending on detection scheme), we only need to correlate using the zero-crossing edges —another significant speedup.</p>



<p>Potential periods are the distances from each of the collected zero-crossing leading edge. For each potential period, we compute the BACF, discard ones with low periodicity, and collect the most significant results. Longer periods typically (but not always) have better BACF results due to better resolution from more samples. But longer periods may also be sub-harmonics of shorter periods. This is taken into account, and detected by determining if the durations are close to integer multiples of a known shorter period. </p>



<p>The sub-collector returns the period (taking advantage of sub-sample accurate computation) of the leading-edge-pair with the best <em>periodicity</em> index, divided by the integer multiple of the period of the shortest leading-edge-pair, with a sufficiently good periodicity index. The sub-collector also returns the <em>periodicity</em> index. </p>



<p>Essentially, the BACF result is only used as a hint used to choose the best edges that demarcate the correct cycle. The accuracy obtained from computing the period from the zero-crossing edges is superior to that found by extrapolating the period from the BACF’s periodicity peak.</p>




</div></div>



<p>For illustration, the figure below exemplifies a specific BACF in action.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3.png"><img src="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3-1024x690.png" alt="" width="640" srcset="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3-1024x690.png 1024w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3-768x517.png 768w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3-1200x808.png 1200w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3-600x404.png 600w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3-300x202.png 300w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf_diagram-3.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The waveform at the top is the raw audio. The middle is the zero-crossing waveform, with non-significant pulses removed by the zero-crossing to bitset transfer filter as described in the Bitset section. The third is the computed BACF periodicity.</p>



<p>There are two distinct candidate periods, p1 and p2, demarcated by edge-pairs, with a duration less than the BACF window (the third, p3 is not distinct; it has the same duration as p2). These periods correspond to the dotted red BACF sections in the graph. It is obvious in this example that the second period, p2, is the best candidate since it has the best periodicity index. The period of p2 is returned, along with its periodicity index (the peak in the BACF result).</p>



<p>Suppose, however that there are more edges that correspond to multiple peaks in the BACF. As described in the Sub-Collector section, we return the period of the best edge-pair (best <em>periodicity</em>), divided by the integer multiple of the period of the shortest edge-pair (with sufficiently good <em>periodicity</em>). The image below is an example with multiple BACF peaks.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1.png"><img src="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1-1024x682.png" alt="" width="640" srcset="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1-1024x682.png 1024w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1-1200x800.png 1200w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1-600x400.png 600w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-multiple-peaks-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Higher frequencies will tend to have more peaks within the BACF window of interest. An octave above the lowest frequency of interest will have two significant peaks. Two octaves above, like in the example above, will have four. We take advantage of the multiple significant peaks to improve precision due to the fact that longer periods will average out to better precision —there are more samples to count (the period is proportional to the number of samples between two edges). That, and sub-sample accuracy from linear interpolation of the zero-crossing edges, contribute to excellent overall precision from the lowest to the highest frequency.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Bias</h3>



<p>Consider this BACF snapshot:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1.png"><img src="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1-1024x682.png" alt="" width="640" srcset="https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1-1024x682.png 1024w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1-1200x800.png 1200w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1-600x400.png 600w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.cycfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bacf-d-string-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>



<p>That is the BACF of the guitar’s D string as it evolves around 14 seconds after note onset. I amplified the raw waveform to make it clear that the second harmonic dominates the fundamental. Here, it is clear that the BACF still detects the fundamental (the higher peak), but at some point, the second harmonic will become more powerful and its BACF peak will eventually catch up. At that point, without taking into account the history of detected frequencies, the second harmonic will be detected as the fundamental. There will be a sudden octave jump.</p>
<p>The <em>bias</em> section takes into account the history and deals with abrupt harmonic shifts (not limited to the first harmonic only). Sudden jumps are not normal. The bias section compares the incoming frequency with the current detected frequency. If a sudden jump is detected, and the incoming frequency is a harmonic of the previous frequency, within a specific deviation (plus minus a few cents), the bias section will prefer the older stable frequency, using the incoming frequency (which may have shifted a bit), divided by the integer multiple of the previous stable frequency.</p>
<p>Finally, the bias section also employs a 3-point median filter in case there’s true (non-harmonic) shift. The median filter eliminates spurious spikes that can happen every once in a while.</p>

<h2 id="1-hey-can-you-please-introduce-yourself">1. Hey, can you please introduce yourself?</h2>



<div><p>Hey! My name is Relja Damnjanovic, I come from Belgrade, Serbia and I’ve been working as a freelance developer for more than 9 years now, and loving every bit of it! Why? Because it’s awesome! 🙂 To tell you the truth, I’m very passionate about many things in life, I love basketball and sports in general, I’m very active in all kinds of sport events, I adore travelling and music festivals, and freelancing is something that is helping me pursue both (or all) my passions.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>For the past 8 or 9 years I’ve been dealing with eCommerce platforms. I started as a regular developer, but grew to be a full-stack developer and even learned a thing or two about running online business, some tips and tricks only masters of the trade tend to use. Magento is my platform of choice, in a way I like its complexity because it allows you to build some amazing things in it, though I do have experience with some other platforms as well.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="2-what-motivated-you-to-choose-remote-working">2. What motivated you to choose remote working?</h2>



<div><p>I’m a Computer Science graduate from a University in Belgrade, and I do have both corporate and freelance experience. Naturally, both have its benefits, I’d be lying if I said freelancing is some sort of perfect work setup. It’s not, it has its own ups and downs and at times it can be a bit too chaotic and uncertain. Corporate working is definitely a more stable and steady type of work, and to some people that is very important, which is completely understandable.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>What really attracted me towards freelancing and remote work is a certain type of freedom you gain with it. You get to choose when you work, on which projects, from where, you’re free to organise your own life in accordance with your work obligations. In a way you are your own boss. That alone means a lot, and it allowed me to fully explore things in a greater manner. I got to travel around the world and become a digital nomad, attend concerts, run marathons all the while my professional career was going forward in its own way.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h2 id="3-what-were-your-initial-months-like-did-it-live-up-to-your-expectations">3. What were your initial months like? Did it live up to your expectations?</h2>



<div><p>Beginnings are tough, that’s for sure. I come from a very modest family, and things in my surroundings were not ideal, so leaving a steady corporate job to go and pursue a freelancing career was a risk and a challenge. From this perspective right now I can say it is one of the best decisions I made in my life, but back then it was difficult. &nbsp;</p></div>



<blockquote><div><p>When you are at the beginning of the freelance career you don’t have the luxury to choose projects you like and you are very limited in negotiating budgets and your fees. It’s simple – you need money to survive and you’re not certain whether another opportunity will come next week or in two months. Also, chances are your portfolio is not that glamorous when you are at the start of the road.&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote>



<div><p>But you overcome it, day by day, month after month, you learn, you grow, you become more efficient, and in the end you get an opportunity to title yourself as a “full-time freelancer” and with it reap all the benefits it brings with itself.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="4-how-did-you-find-remote-working-roles">4. How did you find remote working roles?</h2>



<div><p>In my experience there are 3 ways you can get work and explore new opportunities.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>The first one, and most stable one, is by recommendation, whether it be by your friends, old colleagues or old clients. If someone can vouch for you then the level of mutual understanding and trust between you and your new client is on the decent level from the very beginning. Of course, the crucial condition for this is that you do your work in a highly professional way and deliver good results.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>The second one is your personal presence on the web, your own website, social profiles on various work networks etc. These are not ideal and it’s not always that you will find a common ground with a potential client (as it is in general in the business world), but look at it this way – if someone somewhere is looking for an expert in your area, for a certain project they have in mind, you’d want them to find you and tell you about it.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>The third one are the freelance networks and job sites. These should definitely be your main point of interest. There are various types of networks, and each has a unique set of benefits they offer to the freelancer, so it’ll take some time to try out and see which one suits you the most.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>I find that networks like Toptal suit me the most because they give two-way guarantees to both developers and clients, thus assuring both sides in project cooperation show a significant level of professionalism and seriousness, which is highly valued when it comes to business.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="5-what-have-been-the-best-good-and-worst-aspects-of-remote-working-for-you">5. What have been the best, good and worst aspects of remote working for you?</h2>



<div><p>Working remotely allowed me to become a digital nomad, at least for some time. And it doesn’t matter whether you are a hardcore nomad or occasional, it’s a wonderful experience, to be given a chance to travel, explore different countries, different cultures, cuisines, etc. It gives you a whole new perspective and understanding of the world we live in, makes you value what you have more and also gives you opportunities to try new things and improve your own way of living.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div><p>The “ugly side” of the remote work can sometimes be quite stressful and exhausting. You know that case when you plan a new release deployment and on the very day, in the midst of it, your power grid goes out, or the internet connection goes down. Usually, you tend to keep some sort of a backup approach for these, but they’re often not that effective. &nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>Also, working remotely means you will quite often work with people in different time-zones, which is in general fine, however, sometimes when it’s something urgent or critical and you’re the one they rely on, then it can lead to a sleepless night(s) and disturbance in your everyday routine. It’s very rare but it can happen, and when it does you need to understand it comes with a job and it’s something you need to fight through.&nbsp;</p></div>







<div><p>There are a couple of things I tend to use on all my projects. Given that I work remotely quite often I’d need to do some sort of communication with clients or colleagues. For these I find Slack and Zoom to be precisely what I need and what fulfils my necessities.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>For more technical stuff I always use a GIT repository, most often on BitBucket or GitHub. A task management tool is, in my opinion, a must have, and for these I usually circle between Basecamp, Jira or Kanbanery. A good IDE is also a vital part of your project performance and here I reside much on PHPStorm and (sometimes) Sublime.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>Finally, having a virtual project setup and environment proved to be very efficient and speeds up some of the necessary work processes, so for those I like to use Docker or Vagrant.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="7-your-most-exciting-hilarious-experience-since-you-started-working-remotely">7. Your most exciting/ hilarious experience since you started working remotely.</h2>



<div><p>Meeting someone you’ve been working with for quite a while in person is truly a wonderful experience. You can actually work with someone, talk and chat even for a year or so without actually meeting them in person. Then when you do for the first time you get a strange feeling of a very familiar thing you have never seen before. Kind of like deja vu.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>Working remotely gives you a chance to meet and get to know people from all around the world, and to understand their culture and the way of living better. You’d be amazed how things can be different if you just travel a couple of hours by plane, in any direction.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="8-what-is-your-golden-advice-to-a-new-remote-worker">8. What is your golden advice to a new remote worker?</h2>



<blockquote><p>Simply put – in the words of Jeremy Irons from “Lion King” – Be Prepared. Plan your life and plan your activities accordingly. You’ll hit an obstacle from time to time, it’s going to be tough, but if you are prepared you’ll push through it and will continue to grow.&nbsp;<br></p></blockquote>



<div><p>Always be polite and professional when talking to your clients, even if you think that they do not deserve it. Maintaining a good and friendly relationship will make stuff easier when something critical pops up (and it always does).&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>Be responsible and be professional towards your work. Make sure to deliver the work in agreed terms and timelines, and make sure the results of your work are of high quality. This will make your life much easier in the years to come, as a satisfied client is always a good source for new potential clients.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>Finally, enjoy the ride! Explore new options, new adventures, new opportunities, pursue what you want and like, and not what somebody else might like. Your life will flourish.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="9-how-do-you-see-your-career-shaping-up-and-your-goals">9. How do you see your career shaping up and your goals?</h2>



<div><p>There are so many things I still want to learn and achieve professionally. I’m a senior full-stack developer, and yet I feel like I’m still at the beginning of the road, there are so many things to try out and so many options to explore. The very nature of my profession requires me to constantly learn new things and increase my knowledge, as the technology and system architecture evolves from day to day. But being a freelancer gives me more power in determining which way I want to go and how I want to develop, and just that is what I’m really satisfied with.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2 id="10-how-do-you-expect-remote-working-to-evolve-in-the-future">10. How do you expect remote working to evolve in the future?</h2>



<div><p>Most digital professions are location independent. I think in the time to come, more and more companies will follow the path of quite a few very successful remote companies and will try to organise their departments in such a way. This will not be definitive, for sure, because some types of work require a constant collaboration and heavy brainstorming sessions, which are definitely more efficient when you are in person with a group of people. Also, remote work is not a blessing to everyone, someone likes the …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

          <h3>The Story of M60</h3>
        
        
          <p>A few months ago, we made a hand-wired keyboard and brought Python to it. This project received plenty of attention, but it is difficult for most people to make such a keyboard. We believe that a Python powered keyboard will make a big difference. We'd really like to take this work further, so we start to design a new keyboard hardware. It is called <em>M60</em>.</p>

              <p>Before making this keyboard, I knew Python can be used in a microcontroller thanks to MicroPython and its variant CircuitPython. But I did not know Python can work so well and be so powerful in a keyboard. It's beyond my expectation.</p>

			<p>After years of daydreaming I finally started making music myself. 🎹</p>
<p>This post is mainly a collection of concepts/resources/links/learnings that have helped me.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Selecting your Workhorse: Which DAW?</h3>
<p>Real studio production is for the 1% <em>(professional musicians/producers; people with a lot of money to spare)</em>.</p>
<p>For the rest of us music creation happens on a computer – specifically in a <strong>DAW</strong> <em>(Digital Audio Workstation)</em>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://blog.landr.com/best-daw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guides</a> on the Internet, but effectively the decision comes down to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> How much are you willing/able to spend?</li>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> MacOS vs. Windows vs. Linux all might have different restrictions</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> What are your friends using and recommending?</li>
<li><strong>Preference:</strong> Familiarity with a workflow or certain features that you specifically want from your DAW.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://pics.me.me/ableton-cubase-logic-pro-x-reason-100-hardware-which-daw-3837042.png" alt="I'm the tattooed guy. (source: https://bit.ly/34ZEaUz)" width="500" height="387"><figcaption>I’m the tattooed guy. (source: <a href="https://bit.ly/34ZEaUz" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/34ZEaUz</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p>My situation when deciding:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn’t know if music production is just a momentary itch or rather a hobby I’d do mid-/long-term &gt;&gt;&gt; hence didn’t want to spend too much</li>
<li>I had a MacBook</li>
<li>Most of my friends were using Ableton <em>(b/c Berlin)</em> but I heard that Logic Pro X &amp; ProTools are standards in many studios across the world</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately I chose <strong>Logic Pro X</strong> since it offers the full version for $199 <em>(thousands of instruments, powerful stock plugins/effects, etc.)</em> – I also considered Ableton Live 10 but it was significantly more expensive for the full version.</p>
<p>Most DAWs offer free trials <em>(<a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ableton</a> + <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logic</a> currently offer 90 day trials)</em>.</p>
<h3>Other Tools: What Do You <em>Actually</em> Need?</h3>
<h5><strong>Must Have</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer:</strong> Your computer is your studio</li>
<li><strong>Headphones:</strong> If you invest in one thing of equipment it should be a good pair of headphones <em>(comfortable; good sound; good insulation [if you prefer])</em>. I’m using a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Sony-kabelloser-High-Resolution-Cancelling-Akkulaufzeit-Schwarz/dp/B01LD5GO5U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony MDR 1000x</a> headphones.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Next Steps</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audio Interface:</strong> I use a <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/audio-interfaces/komplete-audio-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6</a> to connect the various elements <em>(headphones; studio monitors; midi input; external audio sources; etc.)</em> of the setup.</li>
<li><strong>Midi Keyboard:</strong> Makes it easier to play/enter sounds in your DAW. I use a <a href="https://www.thomann.de/de/akai_mpk_mini_mk2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKAI MPK mini mk2</a>. Get’s the job done.</li>
<li><strong>Studio Monitors:</strong> Having headphones on 24/7 can accelerate ear fatigue. It helps to have an external source of sound. I currently rock a pair of <a href="https://www.presonus.com/products/Eris-E45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presonus eris e4.5</a> on <a href="https://www.justmusic.de/Recording/Studiomonitore/Zubehoer-fuer-Studiomonitore/Justin-SPS-Desktop-Monitor-Stand?utm_source=PSM&amp;utm_medium=Guenstiger&amp;utm_term=10026396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justIn stands</a> so that the speakers are on head/ear level.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Recorder:</strong> If you want to start recording audio <em>(guitar; voice; DJ set from mixer; ambient sound as samples)</em> then a good audio recorder does the trick. I decided Xoom &amp; Tascam recorders and went for the <a href="https://tascam.com/us/product/dr-40x/top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tascam DR-40X</a> since (1) it was recommended by a friend and (2) it seems that it does not need an attenuator when recording DJ sets.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Nice to Have</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synthesizer:</strong> If you want to play around with a physical box instead of typing in commands into a computer keyboard you should go for a digital or analogue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmcOvAv-egI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synth</a>. I snagged a used <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/monotribe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korg monotribe</a> from ebay. There’s something about haptic play with instruments – it seems to accelerate ‘understanding/grasping’. // With them you can do all sorts of crazy modular synthesis as explained in the video below:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Picking Projects: Original Tracks vs. Remixes?</h3>
<p>It’s much easier for me to deliver output if I have a deadline and accountability towards someone.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to focus on remixes for a start. A couple of benefits I get out of that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Remixing means re-imagining an existing piece of music. You can use either element of the original <em>(key of the track ; melody; rhythm; mood/vibe; etc.)</em> – you don’t start from zero.</li>
<li><strong>Samples:</strong> If someone shares stems with you it’s legally cleared. Avoids headaches. <em>(Let’s be real… at the beginning no one is going to listen to the music // chances are low that you get a letter from the rights holders)</em>. Still, better safe than sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> If you promise a remix you have to deliver. If not, your reputation suffers. That’s a good incentive.</li>
</ul>
<p>My first project was a remix of a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/borfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friend</a>‘s track:</p>


<hr>

<p>So, you want to produce your first track. What now? 🤔</p>
<h3>Core Idea: How to Find Inspiration?</h3>
<p>I recently watched a Masterclass with Hans Zimmer (film composer) where he talks about starting with a <strong>core idea</strong>. Usually something simple enough to play with one finger on a piano. It is easier to expand a simple idea than finding simplicity in a complex idea.</p>
<p>When I start working on a pice of music I go through the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> Which emotions do I want to trigger? Is it rather melancholic or happy?</li>
<li><strong>Tempo:</strong> Is it fast or slow?</li>
<li><strong>Sound:</strong> Does the sound need recognizable elements? Classical music has orchestral sounds, Maya music has flutes and wooden mallets, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> For a remix, do I like the vocals, the synth, the bass line, the percussion? What can I start with – remove the rest – and then build upon?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building Melodies: How to Get Chord Progressions?</h3>
<p>Music theory to the rescue:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="1088" height="612" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgaTLrZGlk0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Once I find a key I like I would search for standard chords and progressions in said key. An example for <a href="http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/key-of-c-minor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C minor</a> would be the following:</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/piano-chords-in-the-key-of-c-minor-746x1024.png" alt="Standard chords in C minior key (source: https://bit.ly/3ePllIf)" width="746" height="1024"><figcaption>Standard chords in C minior key (source: <a href="https://bit.ly/3ePllIf" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/3ePllIf</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This gives a good starting point to play around with melodies and standard progressions. Obviously, if you only stick to standard progressions it can sound predictable but that’s the joy of uncovering a melody that works for you.</p>
<h3>Creating Depth: Sound Design and Layering Sounds</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-layering-in-music-production-and-how-to-do-it-on-FL-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layering</a> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Usually at this step I would do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the core idea and loop it as a 4-bar or 8-bar loop</li>
<li>Add tracks/channels with new sounds to see what fits <em>(try sounds across the entire sound spectrum: low / low-mids / high-mids / high)</em></li>
<li>When all elements are in place tweak/adjust the sounds of each track/channel so that I like it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building the Narrative: Arranging the Track</h3>
<p>When all sounds are selected it is time to go from a repetitive 4-/8-bar loop to an actual arrangement. I usually go through the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure:</strong> Think of simple arrangement structure <em>(Intro &gt; Beat Intro &gt; Verse &gt; Break &gt; Verse &gt; Breakdown &gt; Buildup &gt; Verse &gt; Outro)</em></li>
<li><strong>Curation:</strong> Select which elements go in which section</li>
<li><strong>Listen:</strong> Listen from start to finish to hear what needs improvement <em>(e.g. ‘sounds too busy’ &gt; solution: ‘remove elements’; etc.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Rinse &amp; Repeat:</strong> This step takes quite some time since now it’s detail work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mixing/Mastering: Making It Sound Good</h3>
<p>This step is still so far above my head but these videos have helped to grasp the basics of mixing:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="1088" height="612" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vry9ZDGr56E?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p><em>* This section will be extended in the future.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>2 main ideas have been helpful:</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Finding a simple element as a starting point for production.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Starting exclusively with stock/default plug-ins in Logic Pro X and going deep in the standard setup vs. remaining shallow in an abundance of 3rd-party plug-ins.</li>
<li><strong>Tracks:</strong> Keeping tracks simple at 10-15 elements max.</li>
<li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Time/tooling/idea constraints are a good and fuel creativity. That’s why I’m starting with remixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hygiene</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Save every major update to your track&nbsp;<em>(e.g. new instrument added; drum pattern adjusted; etc.) </em>is saved as a new version of the project (v001, v002, v003…)</li>
<li><strong>Backups:</strong> After a session save the latest version of your track in cloud storage or on an external hard drive.</li>
<li><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Learn your tool and how to use it efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Standardize naming conventions for your tracks/channels (e.g. Lead_…; Vox_…; SFX_…) and bundle/color/route them for faster work.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Wirecard has been one of the biggest accounting scandals in German history and certainly in Europe, so what went wrong? Here is my quick guide and some alternatives.</em></p>
<p>In 2015, the Financial Times began to publish a series of articles called “House of Wirecards”, investigating inconsistencies in the Wirecard’s accounts. The FT suggested there was a whole of €250m in the group’s accounts, Wirecard responded with letters from a UK law firm denying allegations.</p>
<p>That was just the beginning of a stream of allegations and Wirecard’s denial of wrongdoings.</p>
<p>In 2016, anonymous short sellers published a dossier of allegations related to money laundering, which Wirecard denies and German financial regulator - BaFin - started to investigate other allegations of market manipulation. But that didn’t hit Wirecard’s price shares.</p>
<p>Wirecard shares hit a peak price in August 2018, valuing the group at €24bn. At the time Wirecard group had 5,000 employees and processed payments for around 250,000 merchants, prepaid cards and provided contactless technology for smartphone payments.</p>
<p><img src="https://watsnet.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/media_image/image/8201/normal_Picture_2.png" alt="" width="70%"></p>
<p>Fast forward to June 2020 and Wirecard is supposed to publish audited results of 2019 - that’s when things started to come to light about Wirecard’s accounting. To everyone’s dismay, he group had €1.9bn missing from balances, leaving the fintech sector in turmoil.</p>
<p>How could this happen to a company that had been around 20 years, constantly expanding? The first concrete allegation came about last October when the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e753e2b-f576-4f32-aa19-d240be26e773">Financial Times</a> reported that Wirecard staff would be conspiring to fraudulently inflate sales and profits at Wirecard subsidiaries in Dubai and Dublin and also misleading EY, the group’s auditor for almost a decade.</p>
<p>So, EY went to finally check Wiriecards subsidiaries in Singapore, Philippines and Dubai, and surprisingly (for EY),&nbsp; none of these banks had any dealings with Wirecard. In fact, they never had even dealt with Wirecard’s group. And that’s how the missing €1.9bn was discovered.</p>
<p>The group consisted of the holding company,&nbsp; Wirecard AG, that went bust but they had many subsidiaries like Wirecard Solutions in the UK, Wirecard Bank in Germany, Al Alaam in UAE, just to name a few.</p>
<p>How come all this could get passed BaFin? Well, BaFin claimed that they only regulated Wirecard Bank, the German subsidiary, not Wirecard AG - the holding company.&nbsp; Many experts found it strange that BaFin said the Wirebank is fine but didn’t check the balance sheet of the holding company. Also, nobody believed the FT and no-one looked at EY and their procedure for years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, those who have been hit hard by Wirecard AG going bust were the many startups that used them as their payment system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only in the UK, 70 fintechs that used Wirecard Card Solutions (WCS) got their operations suspended and hundreds of thousands customer accounts were frozen by FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), with well known fintechs - Curve, Pockit, Anna Money and Soldo, being affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK fintech community didn’t see FCA’s decision coming as many fintechs relied on Wirecard solely.&nbsp; In a <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/wirecard-impact-uk-fintech/">recent interview</a>, Nigel Verdon, founder of open banking platform Railsbank, said: <em>“I think the UK will be hit more than Germany”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As of 30th June, the FCA’s restrictions on Wirecard clients were lifted but It might take weeks, if not months, for the UK fintechs to recover. For instance, Curve has been working hard to migrate their services away from Wirecard and return to business.</p>
<p>Some fintech experts said that the current model of “Banking-as-Service could implode” because of Wirecard. I’m not sure if I completely agree with this statement because the problem isn’t BaaS <em>per se</em> but regulations around it.</p>
<p>Like Chris Skinner said in a <a href="https://thefinanser.com/2020/06/baas-will-continue-and-wirecard-will-lead-to-micro-regulations.html/">recent post</a>:&nbsp; “<em>More granular regulation would reflect the world of BaaS. Regulations would work at process levels rather than at entity levels, and accountability would be at the process level not at the entity level.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>In your opinion, what kind of new regulations should be implemented?</em></strong></p>

                          <p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><i><span>MVP development for startups</span></i></a><i><span> is anything but trivial. The same goes for picking a startup name. Unlike baby names, ‘I do like the way it sounds’ is not the only decision criterion for startups. The name should be clear, catchy, and legally acceptable.</span></i></p>
<p><span>How to come up with an absolutely stunning (not just gut-feeling-based) startup name? This article will give you an answer.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keywords</b><span>. Come up with a few keywords to get started. You can try Google AdWords to get the keywords people use when searching for similar products. Look for related search queries as well. Then play with the results: mash words together, remove vowels or change certain letters. This is not a magic formula for getting a name that will pocket you billions, but a working option to consider. </span>In case you end up with nothing, steal the keywords your competitors use. Then do the rest.</li>
<li><b>Competitors</b><span>: Get inspiration from rapidly-growing companies that are playing in the same space. Then go for something distinctive, even if a product is</span><del><span> a popular app’s clone</span></del><span> not that unique.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.jpg"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-1024x858.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="858" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-1024x858.jpg 1024w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-300x251.jpg 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-768x643.jpg 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><span>Are you sure that the world needs another Insta-whatever app? Nah, man. To attract users, you have to create something new&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Domain name: </b><span>Is .com available for your app’s name? To search for domain availability, you can use </span><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/"><span>GoDaddy.com</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/"><span>NetworkSolutions.com</span></a><span>. We’re not convincing you to ignore other domains (there is a bunch of alternatives like .co, .io or .net), but .com is still the king and remains the most trusted one.</span></li>
<li><b>Trademark. </b><span>There might be no one in your state with the name you’re going to use. But someone in another state might be using it as a trademark. ‘Simply ignore this’ rule doesn’t work here. </span><span>There’s nothing worse than stepping into trademark conflict when trying to expand a business (this typically occurs after a startup team has already spent a lot on app development and marketing).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Find out if your startup name is already registered. If you’re from the USA, you can check it at </span><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/"><span>USPTO.gov</span></a><span> and see whether a certain name has been trademarked or not.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>P.S: Consider consulting an attorney to know exactly your startup name doesn’t infringe on someone else’s trademark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Social networks</b><span>. Is there anything else to do to choose a startup name? Do a search on websites like Facebook, Linkedin or Instagram (</span><span>anything that might be relevant to your startup promotion in the future) </span><span>and see what you find before maintaining a social media presence.</span></li>
<li><b>App Stores</b><span>: Go to both Apple Store and Google Play and check if there’s someone who already uses the name you want to go with. Even if you think you’ll never need a mobile app. One day you’ll be ready to expand the audience and it would be smart to do app name search beforehand.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How to choose a startup name? A few words on being ‘clear and catchy’</b></h2>
<p><span>How to come up with something truly memorable and easy-to-get? Check out this example to ensure you clearly understand how to choose a startup name:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.jpg"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.jpg 1920w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a><span>Can you explain what the app ‘TripAdvisor’&nbsp; does? Of course, it provides trip recommendations. Done!</span></p>
<p><span>As for the ‘catchiness’, simply test it out on your own. Gather 10 random people, expose them to a few names and then follow up a week later. The names remembered are catchy. Choose a startup name — this ain’t atomic physics, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-567">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
		<p>Documentation is important. All of us have experienced the challenge of finding the documentation we need, and most of us have struggled to try and write well.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it need not be so difficult.</p>
<p>Following is an easy approach plus a few guidelines that will help to produce &amp; maintain real, usable, documentation easily.</p>

<h2>The Easy Way to Write Documentation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to write documentation, is to start a page quickly and get a couple of sections and basic bullet points down. This will take only 15-30 minutes and captures much of the value. Finish for now.</p>
<p>Over the next day, you’ll likely think of a couple of points you missed.&nbsp; Take 15 minutes to add those in, and wrap the content up.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done this a few times, you’ll find you are capturing the most useful content quickly, and fairly comprehensively; and that doing this takes little difficulty.</p>
<p>It is always possible to spend longer and capture more detail, but much of the value for most audiences is in the big picture. So you do not need to capture the world now.&nbsp;Over time, you and your team, can always return to add more.</p>
<p>Documentation should be a live, as-you-go process which the entire team contributes to.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The best time to write documentation is when you are working on that area; but don’t hesitate to back-fill gaps as you find them. Frequent small improvements make a big difference.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Many people struggle to know how to start writing a page, or to know what goals it should fulfill. A few simple principles will help.</p>
<h3>Within the Page</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Within a single page, a few basics are key:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Target the audience.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Think of the audience who will need to read your documentation. They probably have some general technical knowledge, but don’t know your specific feature or acronyms. Express your writing so they can understand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Identify the page well. </strong>
<ul>
<li>For example, give the page a good title; and provide a concise statement of what the page is about at the top. This is because the first thing readers need, are to find the page and determine whether it relates to their question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Front-load an overview.</strong>
<ul>
<li>A concise overview enables audiences to understand what something is, and the basic ideas of how it should work. The overview is often the most useful useful and valuable part of the documentation, for the majority of audiences, and should be presented as the first section in the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Combine brief narrative with bullet points.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bullet points are faster to read &amp; write and express clear facts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Link to related content.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Links are hugely important in Wiki and web content. They show readers what content is specifically related and important, and enable an audience to rapidly explore connected pages &amp; topics to understand the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Organizing Content within the Wiki</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">When organizing pages within a Confluence hierarchy, keep these principles in mind to help audiences find &amp; navigate content:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Structure the hierarchy&nbsp;by Topic or Category.</b>
<ul>
<li>Categories can be: <strong>business function/ audience, software component, feature, lifecycle status</strong>, etc.</li>
<li>Note that some pages can benefit from organizing their child content with more than one dimension. For example, existing features could be grouped by component, while planned features could be grouped under status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Front-load useful information.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Always ensure that key information such as Overview, Status and Navigation are available on the upper pages;<br>
do not push these down to child pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Manage the number of children;</strong> but balance this against cohesiveness and front-loading information.</li>
<li><strong>Keep content cohesive.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use ‘aspect pages’ or mentions where topics interact across the&nbsp;</strong><b>hierarchy</b>.
<ul>
<li>Placing a contextual mention or aspect page in the other hierarchy, makes the topic clearly visible from the perspective of that audience/ business function/ component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Writing a Page – 7 Key Steps</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Here are seven simple steps to help you write a useful page:</p>
<table data-number-column="false" data-layout="default" data-autosize="true">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Title for searchability</strong></td>
<td>Title the page by what the audience might be looking for. Use commonly-understood terminology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>‘Statement of Purpose’ at the top</strong><br>
also, <strong>Status</strong> (if not current &amp; active)</td>
<td>Start the page with 1-2 sentences on what the page is about. Write from the perspective of a reader who is not immediately familiar with the topic, using standard Business English. This will place it into context for the reader, and enable them to easily understand whether the page is relevant to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Contents</b></td>
<td>If you’ve got more than a couple of sections of content, add a ‘Table of Contents’ macro before the Overview.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>‘Overview’ section</strong></td>
<td>Write a couple of paragraphs of narrative and/or bullet points, stating the most important points about the topic. Use an H1 or H2 heading.&nbsp;<strong>A clear Overview is often the most important part of the documentation.</strong>
<p>Key aspects to cover in the Overview include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong> and context – what is the purpose of the component/ feature/ topic, and what wider context this exists in.</li>
<li><strong>Lifecycle</strong> – what is its lifecycle? Often a brief statement, but for more complex lifecycles state where it comes from/ is created and where it goes to/ is consumed.</li>
<li><strong>Interactions</strong> – what else does it interact with.</li>
<li>sometimes <strong>Technical Underpinnings</strong> – less important to understanding what something is, but if there’s space in the Overview we can add a simple point or two.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brief Narrative + Bullet Points</strong></td>
<td>Use a little narrative first, then get straight into the bullet points. Bullet points are preferable to&nbsp; narrative because:
<ul>
<li>They’re fast &amp; easy to write</li>
<li>They’re easier to read</li>
<li>They avoid wasting time faffing around with all the connecting words needed for narrative writing.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Detail Sections</strong><br>
(where applicable)</td>
<td>The Overview intends to convey “what it is” in 10-15 seconds. Detail beyond this, should be structured into one or more Detail sections.
<p>If the page is getting longer than two screen-heights or the detail would be useful to less than 20% of the audience or page views (eg. detailed trouble-shooting or technical procedures), consider pushing the less-relevant detail sections down to a child page.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Child Page/ Subcategory Navigation</strong><br>
(where applicable)</td>
<td>Add a “Section” heading and use a Confluence ‘Children’ macro with depth=1 or 2, to show child pages automatically.
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;table&quot;,null,&quot;tableRow&quot;,null,&quot;tableCell&quot;,null]">This front-load navigation on the page; and will be self-maintaining, unlike manually curated links.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>‘See Also’ links</strong></td>
<td>Add a ‘See Also’ heading and bullet-point a few relevant links. These may be useful lateral links, or particularly important child or parent pages. These enable lateral navigation across hierarchy boundaries, and greatly improve the ability of readers to explore &amp; understand a topic.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Organizing Content – Another 7 Steps</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">While the number is purely coincidental, another seven basic steps will help you organize content:</p>
<table data-number-column="false" data-layout="default" data-autosize="true">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Organize the Top Level</strong></td>
<td>The top level is most important, as it where many users start navigating. Lay out a clear structure that addresses business functions, audiences and technical structure in a meaningful way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]"><b>Structure the hierarchy&nbsp;by Topic or Category</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null,&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]">Categories can be: <strong>business function/ audience, software component, feature, lifecycle status</strong>, etc.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null,&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]">If you have a few child topics, these can be listed directly. If you have many child topics, group some or all of them under category subpages.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]"><strong>Front-load useful information</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null,&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]">Always ensure that key information such as Overview, Status etc are available on the upper pages; do not push these down to child pages.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null,&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]">The corollary of this is, as a page gets large, to push infrequently-used content down.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<strong>Front-load navigation</strong></td>
<td>Category pages should offer a prominent navigation section. The Confluence ‘Children’ macro with depth=1 or depth=2 is great to build quick &amp; easy navigation for readers.
<p>While it’s good to offer the most important child pages/ resources as curated links, prefer to supplement this with a ‘Children’ macro for most navigation as it’s self-maintaining.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]"><strong>Manage the number of children</strong></p>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;But balance this against the benefits of cohesiveness and front-loading information.
<ul>
<li>A guideline of five to eight is children is ideal, but should be balanced against other factors.</li>
<li>It is very reasonable to bend the guideline where good reasons exist. It’s common for a top-level page to have 12-15 children, or a major category landing page where numerous facets converge to have 10-14 children.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]"><strong>Keep content cohesive</strong></p>
</td>
<td>Balance this with other factors, but it’s beneficial to keep the most useful aspects of a topic together.
<p>Do consider this in terms of the audience &amp; how often content will be used. Different audiences or infrequently-used content may provide good reasons to split something out.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;orderedList&quot;,null,&quot;listItem&quot;,null]"><strong>Topics interacting across the&nbsp;</strong><b>hierarchy</b></p>
</td>
<td>Where topics interact across the hierarchy, create an ‘Aspect page’ or mention in that part of the hierarchy.
<ul>
<li>For a small or modest interaction: bidirectional links and either a brief bullet point or a section in the page, might suffice.</li>
<li>For a major interaction: create an ‘Aspect page’ in the other hierarchy, presenting that aspect of the topic. Link this aspect page and the main topic bidirectionally.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>How to Design a Hierarchy</h2>
<p>In a Wiki hierarchy, content should be organized by key factors including organizational purpose, software component, feature area, and specific feature.</p>
<p>The appropriate categorization approach and order in which levels can best be structured, may vary somewhat according to the needs of the particular organization &amp; software product.</p>
<p>In recent roles I have had success with the hierarchies similar to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Business Function/ Audience
<ul>
<li>eg. Technical Reference, Developer Guides, Testing, Releasing, Support etc.</li>
<li>Note that we split ‘technical/ architecture reference’ materials from all ‘developer practice/ process how-to’. This enabled a useful separation between actionable guidance &amp; tutorial material, and the ‘why is it designed this way’ reference material.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software Component</li>
<li>Feature Area</li>
<li>Specific Features
<ul>
<li>Overview, major functionalities, relationships &amp; interactions with other components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subordinate Details (if needed).</li>
</ol>

        <p><a href="https://picterra.ch/" target="_blank">Picterra</a> enables users to train custom detectors - deep learning models - and apply them at scale on drone, aerial or satellite imagery. Without writing a single line of code.</p>
        <p>This is an example of how SEGES - one of Picterra's customers - was
          able to detect 26.000 slurry tanks over Denmark in a few hours with only 56

        <p>SEGES is a part of the agricultural advisory service and owned by the Danish farmers.</p>
        <p>In order to calculate the total Danish emission of ammonia the Ministry of Environment needed
          data on the total number of slurry tanks and information on the coverage of the tanks, as the emission
          factors are lower for covered tanks than from uncovered tanks.</p>

        <p>Slurry tanks are round-shaped objects. There is quite some variety in their appearance
          though because they can be filled or empty and they can have a roof or not.
          They also look similar to silos that are also found near farms.

    <p>Have you ever thought about how people learn? What happens inside your brain when you learn some new information or practice a novel skill? And is there a way to enhance the outcomes of learning?</p>
<p>This article is the first in the series on “How People Learn,” in which I invite you to embark on a journey toward a better understanding of the most sophisticated construct in the Universe—the human brain.</p>
<p>And I would like to start with and exercise. You will need a piece of paper and something to write with. When you have them ready, write down the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I can write fast and beautiful.</strong></p>

<p>It should be pretty easy, if not effortless, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Now, I would like you to write the same sentence one more time, below the first one, but at this time, use the opposite hand (let’s call it the inexperienced hand). Therefore, if you initially wrote the sentence with your right hand, switch your pen to the left side and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Think about how was it now? Unless you are a person that learned to write with both hands, I bet your second sentence is not that beautiful, and you wrote it not that fast either. When I was lecturing at the university and doing this exercise with my students, it took them somewhere between 3 to 10 times longer to write down the second sentence than the first one.</p>
<p>If you did follow through and write the two sentences, I highly encourage you to write it with the inexperienced hand for the third (and last) time below the first two sentences. It should be slightly easier to write it now, but there will still be inadvertent trembling and awkward lines.</p>
<p>How do you explain this? You know how each letter should look, how it should be tilted, and how curved it should be—you possess the theory at 100%. Yet very few can draw a well-rounded letter ‘a’ or ‘o’ with their inexperienced hand. It is very likely that you are also holding your pen as though it weighs 5kg, and your hand is trembling in the process.</p>
<h2 id="a-primer-on-brain-structure">A Primer On Brain Structure</h2>
<p>The answer resides in the structure of the brain. As you might know, the brain consists of brain cells called “neurons.” Let’s represent a neuron as in the next image.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/one-neuron.png" alt="A Conceptual Representation Of A Neuron"></p>
<p>Neurons connect to other neurons, forming a complex net of interconnected brain cells. According to the latest plausible estimates,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> there are 86 billion neurons in a human brain. And each cell can connect to up to ten thousand other neurons. That is an astounding amount!</p>
<p>I will not attempt to draw such a complex, interconnected set of neurons as in a human brain. I will not try to represent even the 302 neurons with its ~7,500 connections of a roundworm.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Instead, I will rely on this <em>extremely</em> simplified version of a <strike>brain</strike> group of interconnected neurons to describe some essential events that take place inside one’s brain.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/many-interconnected-neurons.png" alt="A Conceptual Representation Of Many Interconnected Neurons"></p>
<p>All our memories, experiences, skills, thoughts, sensations, etc. are encoded and stored within those interconnected brain cells.</p>
<h2 id="neural-patterns">Neural Patterns</h2>
<p>Neurons communicate with each other through electric pulses and chemical neurotransmitters. Whenever we do something or think about something, specific neurons responsible for that action or thought get activated by sending impulses to each other. For instance, when you raise your right hand, a particular group of neurons gets activated simultaneously:</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-raise-hand.png" alt="A conceptual representation of the neural pattern responsible for raising your right hand"></p>
<p>When you write, another group of neurons fires together:</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-write.png" alt="A conceptual representation of the neural pattern responsible for writing"></p>
<p>These groups of neurons that fire together are called <em>neural patterns.</em> When activated, they are responsible for specific actions or thoughts. Keep in mind that the examples above are extremely simplified. Real patterns spread throughout large portions of the brain and can incorporate billions of neurons.</p>
<p>Note that these patterns can overlap, meaning that the same neuron or even huge chunks of neurons can be part of several patterns. Below you can see that <em>“writing”</em> and <em>“raising hand”</em> share some of their neurons.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-common-neurons.png" alt="A conceptual representation of the neurons that participate in both raising hand and speaking"></p>
<p>This explains the associative nature of memory and our experiences—as you are thinking about something specific (i.e., your favorite childhood cartoon), parts of the neural patterns that get activated are also parts of circuits related to other memories. That gives you the possibility to “hop” from one memory to the other. Just try to recall an instance of when you watched that cartoon and let your mind wander for some time. You’ll be pleasantly surprised with where it might lead you.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-not-only-about-the-number-of-connections">It Is Not Only About The Number Of Connections</h2>
<p>Besides the number of neurons, one essential thing that characterizes a pattern is the strength of its connections. A connection can be strong or can be weak, and it represents the relationship between two neurons.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-strong-connections.png" alt="A conceptual representation of a neural pattern with different connection strengths between neurons"></p>
<p>In the image above, the thicker lines represent more durable links. The stronger a bond is, the easier it is to communicate between neurons through it, and the harder and longer it takes to break it apart. We’ll see the implications of this in the next section below.</p>
<p>Therefore, activities that we know how to do and with which we have experience and thoughts that we think about often have strong links between neurons in their associated patterns. Conversely, skills we have just begun to practice, or thoughts we rarely think about have weak circuits.</p>
<p>To make an analogy, think of a link between two neurons as a pathway during winter.</p>
<figure>

<p>Initially, when you have to go from point A to B, there is no path, so you have to walk through deep snow, leaving a narrow trail in the process. Have you ever walked in deep snow? That is exhausting, and so forming new circuits is. But the more you travel along that path, the more trodden it becomes, and the easier it is to walk it. Eventually, it will become a wide sidewalk that you can use to travel between point A and B effortlessly. But if you will abandon that path, the snow will gradually claim it back, until one day it will just disappear.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-of-forming-new-circuits">The Process Of Forming New Circuits</h2>
<p>Thus, all the information we know and skills we possess are encoded in our brains’ neural patterns. It is time to discuss the process of brain circuits administration. Research from the last 100 years has incredibly advanced the understanding of how the brain rewires itself. This process is called  <em>Neuroplasticity.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Neuroplasticity,</strong> also known as <strong>brain plasticity,</strong> is the ability of the brain to undergo biological changes ranging from the cellular level (i.e., individual neurons) all the way to large-scale changes involving cortical remapping.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of how neuroplasticity functions is the idea that individual connections within the brain are continually being created, strengthened, or removed, largely dependent upon how they are used.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Thus, neurons that are in close proximity and fire at the same time tend to form new connections (or, if they are already connected, the link strengthens). But in case a relationship is not used, it weakens over time, and eventually, it disappears, leaving the two neurons disconnected.</p>
<p>This theory was first introduced by Donald Hebb in 1949, and it is often summarized as <em>“neurons that fire together, wire together."</em></p>
<h2 id="going-back-to-writing">Going Back To Writing</h2>
<p>Knowing all that about our brain circuits and how they function, let’s analyze the previous writing exercise and describe it using our freshly acquired information.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-write-strong-connections.png" alt="Strong neural circuit responsible for writing with the experienced hand"></p>
<p>When you first wrote the sentence with your “regular” hand, you have used your existing, robust neural pattern responsible for writing with that hand. That’s why it felt natural and seamless.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/2-hands-with-question-mark.png" alt="Inexistent neural circuit responsible for writing with the inexperienced hand"></p>
<p>But when you switched to the other hand, no pattern was found responsible for writing with that hand, so a new one started to emerge.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/2-hands-with-both-patterns.png" alt="Emerging neural circuit responsible for writing with the experienced hand"></p>
<p>Different neurons fired together while you were striving to write each letter, and new links started to form. In case you followed my advice and wrote the sentence for the third time, the writing process should have flown more easygoing. That’s because the new pattern is strengthening in the brain! The more you will practice writing with that hand, the easier it will become for you.</p>
<p>This simple exercise demonstrated a fundamental truth that we sometimes ignore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge != Skills</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a sound pattern responsible for the knowledge about each individual letter and another circuit that is responsible for writing those letters. If you would take one thing out of this article, please remember this: <strong>knowledge</strong> does not necessarily mean <strong>skills.</strong> You might know something (the alphabet), but this does not imply than you will be able to write those letters.</p>
<p>This principle applies to many areas of our lives. For instance, reading a book on self-improvement, sales, public speaking, or anything else, does not magically teach you the skills described in those books. Reading those books will strengthen your neuronal pattern related to knowing. It’s like learning the shape of letters, the theory. Only when you begin to write, when you apply the theory into practice, then you start developing the patterns responsible for the actual skills.</p>
<p>There is much more to possessing an ability than just knowing the theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing the shape of the letters is not enough to be able to write. You need to develop proper muscle movement to hold the pen and draw the lines that form the letters.</li>
<li>Knowing some five steps to efficient sales is not enough to be a salesman. You need to learn to listen to customers, understand what relevant questions to ask, process the information you receive, formulate correct benefits that solve their problems, etc.</li>
<li>Knowing how to write code does is not enough to be a programmer. You need to understand how to define the architecture of a project based on the requirements, how to organize and structure your code, how to test it, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not mean that the theory is not essential. Conversely, knowledge about a domain helps you gain experience faster since you can interpret how good or bad the outcome of your practice is. As described in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/the-path-toward-mastery-how-to-become-an-expert/">The Pyramid Of Mastery</a>, knowledge and skills are complementary. …</p></div></div>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/thatskriptkid/apk-infector-Archinome-PoC">Proof-of-Concept Link</a></strong></p>

<p>Target audience of the article - people who have an idea of the current way of infecting android applications through smali code patching and want to learn about a new and more effective way. If you are not familiar with the current infection practice, read my article - <a href="https://orderofsixangles.com/en/2019/07/17/steal-ds-en.html">How to steal digital signature using Man-In-The-Disk</a>, chapter - “Creating payload”. The technique described here was completely invented by us; there is no description of such a method in the Internet.</p>

<p>Our technique:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does not use bugs or android vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Not intended for cracking applications (removing ads, licenses, etc.).</li>
  <li>Designed to add malicious code without any interference with the target application or its appearance.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="disadvantages-of-the-current-approach">Disadvantages of the current approach</h2>

<p>The way to inject malicious code by decoding the application to smali code and patching it is the only and widely practiced method to date. <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali">smali/backsmali</a> is the only tool used for this. It is the basis for all known apk infectors, for example:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dana-at-cp/backdoor-apk">backdoor-apk</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Screetsec/TheFatRat">TheFatRat</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jbreed/apkwash">apkwash</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sensepost/kwetza">kwetza</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Malware also uses smali/backsmali and patching. The work algorithm of the Trojan <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=17771929&amp;lng=en">Android.InfectionAds.1</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://orderofsixangles.com/assets/images/infecting_android/img_for_paper/android_infection_ads_01_en.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Decoding and patching involves changing the original classesN.dex file. This leads to two problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Overstepping <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex#about">the limit of 65536</a> methods <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/issues/629">in one DEX file</a> if there is too much malicious code.</li>
  <li>The application can check the integrity of DEX files</li>
</ol>

<p>DEX decoding/disassembling is a complex process that requires constant updating and <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/issues/595">highly dependent on the android version</a>.</p>

<p>Almost all available infection/modification tools are written in Java and/or depend on JVM - this greatly narrows the scope of use and makes it impossible to launch the infectors on routers, embedded systems, systems without JVM, etc.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-a-new-approach">Description of a new approach</h2>

<p>There are several types of starting applications in the android, one of which is called cold start. Cold start happens when application is started for the first time.</p>

<p><img src="https://orderofsixangles.com/assets/images/infecting_android/img_for_paper/cold_launch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The execution of an application starts with the creation of an Application object. Most android applications have their own Application class, which should extends the main class <code>android.app.Applciation</code>. An example of a class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>test.pkg</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>android.app.Application</span><span>;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>TestApp</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Application</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>TestApp</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>onCreate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>super</span><span>.</span><span>onCreate</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The class <code>test.pkg.TestApp</code> should be registered in AndroidManifest.xml:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;manifest</span> <span>xmlns:android=</span><span>"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"</span>
    <span>package=</span><span>"com.example"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;application</span>
        <span>android:icon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher"</span>
        <span>android:label=</span><span>"Test"</span>
        <span>android:roundIcon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"</span>
        <span>android:name=</span><span>"test.pkg.TestApp"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/application&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/manifest&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The process of launching such an application:</p>

<p><img src="https://orderofsixangles.com/assets/images/infecting_android/img_for_paper/Usual_app_launch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The basic requirements for our infection techniques have been defined:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Execution of malicious code, at application launch</li>
  <li>Saving all steps of the process of launching the original application</li>
</ol>

<p>The injection of the malicious code took place at the stage of the <em>cold start</em>:<em>Application Object creation-&gt;Application Object Constructor</em>. A malicious Application class was created, injected in the APK and spelled out in <em>AndroidManifest.xml</em>, instead of the original one. To preserve the previous execution chain, it was inherited from <code>test.pkg.TestApp</code>.</p>

<p>Malicious Application class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>my.malicious</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>test.pkg</span><span>;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>InjectedApp</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TestApp</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>InjectedApp</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>super</span><span>();</span>
        <span>executeMaliciousPayload</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Modified AndroidManifest.xml:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;manifest</span> <span>xmlns:android=</span><span>"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"</span>
    <span>package=</span><span>"com.example"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;application</span>
        <span>android:icon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher"</span>
        <span>android:label=</span><span>"Test"</span>
        <span>android:roundIcon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"</span>
        <span>android:name=</span><span>"my.malicious.InjectedApp"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/application&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/manifest&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The process of launching malicious code inside an infected application (modifications are marked in red):</p>

<p><img src="https://orderofsixangles.com/assets/images/infecting_android/img_for_paper/Infected_app_launch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Applied modifications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The class <code>my.malicious.InjectedApp</code> was added to the original APK</li>
  <li>In AndroidManifest.xml the line <code>test.pkg.TestApp</code> has been replaced with <code>my.malicious.InjectedApp</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-the-new-approach">The benefits of the new approach</h2>

<p>It is possible to apply necessary modifications to the APK:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Without AndroidManifest.xml decoding/encoding</li>
  <li>Without DEX dissasembling/assembling</li>
  <li>Without making changes to the original DEX files</li>
</ol>

<p>These facts allow you to infect almost any existing application without restrictions. Adding your own class and modifying the manifest works much faster than decoding DEX. The malicious code injected by our technology starts immediately, as we are injected right at the beginning of the application launch process. The described infection technique doesn’t depend on the architecture and version of the android (with a few exceptions).</p>

<p>The PoC for demonstration was written in Go and is capable to be extended to a full featured tool. PoC is compiled into one binary file and does not use any runtime dependencies. Using Go allows using cross compilation to build an infector for almost any architecture and OS.</p>

<p>Testing of infected APK by PoC was on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>NOX player 6.6.0.8006-7.1.2700200616, Android 7.1.2 (API 25), ARMv7-32

NOX player 6.6.0.8006-7.1.2700200616, Android 5.1.1 (API 22), ARMv7-32

Android Studio Emulator, Android 5.0 (API 21), x86

Android Studio Emulator, Android 7.0 (API 24), x86

Android Studio Emulator, Android 9.0 (API 28), x86_64

Android Studio Emulator, Android 10.0 (API 29), x86

Android Studio Emulator, Android 10.0 (API 29), x86_64

Android Studio Emulator, Android API 30, x86

Xiaomi Mi A1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We managed to successfully infect a huge number of applications (for obvious reasons, the names are hidden). We managed to successfully infect applications that cannot be decoded using smali/backsmali, and therefore by existing tool.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-necessary-modifications-in-androidmanifestxml-and-patching">Identifying necessary modifications in AndroidManifest.xml and patching</h2>

<p>One of the modifications required for the infection is to replace the string in AndroidManifest.xml. It is possible to patch the string without decoding/encoding the manifest.</p>

<p>APKs contain the manifest in binary encoded form. The structure of the binary manifest is undocumented and represents a custom XML encoding algorithm from Google. For convenience, <a href="https://github.com/thatskriptkid/Kaitai-Struct-Android-Manifest-binary-XML">was created</a> a description in <a href="https://kaitai.io/">Kaitai Struct</a> that can be used as documentation.</p>

<p>AndroidManifest.xml structure (in brackets - size in bytes):</p>

<p><img src="https://orderofsixangles.com/assets/images/infecting_android/img_for_paper/Manifest_draw.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Two applications with different class names were developed to detect changes in the manifest, after patching the original Application class name to a malicious one. The applications were built into an APK and unpacked to produce binary manifests.</p>

<p>An example of the original manifest:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;manifest</span> <span>xmlns:android=</span><span>"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"</span>
    <span>package=</span><span>"com.qoogle.service.outbound.thread.safe.eng.packages.packas.pack.level.random"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;application</span>
        <span>android:icon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher"</span>
        <span>android:label=</span><span>"MinDEX"</span>
        <span>android:roundIcon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"</span>
        <span>android:name=</span><span>"test.pkg.TestApp"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/application&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/manifest&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An example of a patched manifest:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;manifest</span> <span>xmlns:android=</span><span>"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"</span>
    <span>package=</span><span>"com.qoogle.service.outbound.thread.safe.eng.packages.packas.pack.level.random"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;application</span>
        <span>android:icon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher"</span>
        <span>android:label=</span><span>"MinDEX"</span>
        <span>android:roundIcon=</span><span>"@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"</span>
        <span>android:name=</span><span>"test.pkg.TestAppAAAAAAAAA"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/application&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/manifest&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The length of the fully-qualified class name has increased by 9 characters. Both files were opened in <a href="https://www.fairdell.com/hexcmp/">HexCmp</a>, to get the diff.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <p>An article called “<a href="https://coady.github.io/posts/closing-files/">Contrarian view on closing
      files</a>” is on the front page of Hacker News right now with over 60 upvotes. It starts off with a quote from
      the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#311-files-and-sockets">Google Python style
      guide</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Explicitly close files and sockets when done with them. Leaving files, sockets or other file-like objects
        open unnecessarily has many downsides […]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The article’s main complaint is that “this advice is applying a notably higher standard of premature
      optimization to file descriptors than to any other kind of resource”. It complains that it’s “depressingly
      commonplace” to see code like this:</p>
      <figure>
        <pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"README.md"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>readme</span><span>:</span>
    <span>long_description</span> <span>=</span> <span>readme</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>()</span></code></pre>
      </figure>
      <p>Sure, if it’s a one-off read of a doc file, you can almost certainly get away with just <code>open("README.md").read()</code>, but I honestly have no idea what’s
      depressing about code that just works reliably.</p>
      <p>Leaving files and sockets open is something that you can usually get away with, until weird stuff happens.
      And, no, it’s not just about running out of file descriptors (although that does happen, too). I’ve previously
      written about <a href="https://theartofmachinery.com/2018/12/05/gc_not_enough.html">servers that mysteriously ran out of disk space because
      (spoiler) they were deleting files that hadn’t been closed properly</a>. Regardless of how awesome your computer
      and network equipment are, the number of TCP connections you can make to a given host and port are limited by a
      16 bit integer (and practically always limited more by your <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/linux-increase-ip_local_port_range-tcp-port-range/">network settings</a>), then you get
      network failures. Writing to files that you don’t explicitly close (or flush) is especially dicey — the write
      might actually happen straight away, then on another day or another environment it might get delayed.</p>
      <p>Sure, these failure modes aren’t very common, but they definitely happen. I can think of three examples right
      now from the past few years of my day job. Closing files as a habit is easier than figuring out when it’ll go
      wrong.</p>
      <p>The article has an example of a function that lazily loads JSON given a file path string. Sure, it doesn’t
      work properly if you close the file inside the function, but I’d say the problem is in the API design: the file
      handle resource straddles the interface.</p>
      <p>The first good alternative is to keep the file handle completely inside: take a path argument, load the data
      eagerly, close the file and return the parsed data. The other good alternative is to keep the file handle
      completely outside: take a file handle as argument and return it wrapped in a lazy JSON parser. Either way makes
      it easier to see how and where the file should be closed.</p>
      <p>The Google advice is pretty solid: when you’re done with a file or socket, just close it. I’ll add: sure,
      maybe it won’t always be obvious when you’re done with a handle, but perhaps that code design is making life more
      “exciting” than necessary. Production failures are more depressing than file closing code ever will be.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> An EPFL laboratory has developed Datashare Network, a decentralized search engine paired with a secure messaging system that allows investigative journalists to exchange information securely and anonymously. An scientific article on this subject will be presented during the Usenix Security Symposium which will be held online from August 12 to 14.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),&nbsp;which has over 200 members in 70 countries, has&nbsp;broken a number of important stories, particularly ones that expose medical fraud and tax evasion.&nbsp;One of its most famous investigations was the Panama Papers, a trove of millions of documents that revealed the existence of several hundred thousand shell companies whose owners included cultural figures, politicians, businesspeople and sports personalities.&nbsp;To complete an investigation of this size is only possible through international cooperation between journalists. When sharing such sensitive files, however, a leak can jeopardize not only&nbsp;the story’s publication, but also the safety of&nbsp;the&nbsp;journalists and sources involved. At the ICIJ’s behest, EPFL’s Security and Privacy Engineering (SPRING) Lab recently developed Datashare Network, a fully anonymous, decentralized system for searching and exchanging information. A paper about it will be presented during the Usenix Security Symposium, a worldwide reference for specialists, which will be held online from 12 to 14 August.</p><p><strong>Anonymity at every stage</strong></p><p>Anonymity is the backbone of the system. Users can search and exchange information without revealing their identity, or the content of their queries, either to colleagues or to the ICIJ. The Consortium ensures that the system is running properly but remains unaware of any information exchange. It issues virtual secure tokens that journalists can attach to their messages and documents to prove to others that they are Consortium members. A centralized file management system would be too conspicuous a target for hackers; since the ICIJ does not have servers in various jurisdictions, documents are typically stored on its members’ servers or computers. Users provide only the elements that enable others to link to their investigation.</p><p>Users searching for information enter keywords in the search engine. If the search produces hits, they can then contact colleagues – whose identity remains protected – who are in possession of potentially relevant documents. Search queries are sent encrypted to all users, if there is a macth the querier gets an alert and can decide whether they wish to enter in contact and share information. “Given the fact that users work in different time zones, some with only a few hours of internet access per day, it was critical that searches and responses could take place asynchronously,” notes Carmela Troncoso, who runs the SPRING Lab at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC). Another messaging system, also secure and anonymous, is subsequently used for two-way exchanges.</p><p><strong>Two completely new secure applications</strong></p><p>“This system, which addresses real-world needs, has enabled SPRING to tackle some interesting challenges,” notes Troncoso. The research team drew on existing authentication mechanisms and anonymous communication primitives, which they then optimized. They also developed two completely new secure building blocks that are described in the paper being published today in connection with the Usenix Security Symposium – an asynchronous search engine and a messaging system. A new protocol, known as “multi-set private set intersection” (MS-PSI), ensures the security of the search engine, allowing users to easily search a large number of databases without increasing the risk of leaks. The messaging system relies on a large number of single-use virtual mailboxes and is based on the well-known “pigeonhole” system, which chooses one option at random, in this case one of the mailboxes. Currently, the system does not allow users to exchange documents. “At this stage in the process, journalists are using other secure messaging systems,” Troncoso says.</p><p>Working with the Consortium has allowed SPRING to frame new requirements that are rarely examined in the scientific literature. Datashare can be scaled to thousands of users and millions of documents while encrypting all communications. “The hurdles we encountered during the development process, however, have paved the way to a new area of research with significant potential for other fields,” Troncoso concludes.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>
<p>I have been trying to understand the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexical hypothesis</a>” of personality, and its modern descendant, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Factor Model of personality</a>, for <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">several</a> <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/24/the-extended-sniff-test/">months</a>. In that time, I have said some provocative things about the Big Five, and even some unkind things that I admit were unbecoming to a banana. Here, I wish to situate the Five Factor Model in the context of its historical development and modern use, and to demonstrate to the reader the surprising accomplishment that it represents for the field of psychology.<span id="more-732"></span></p>
<p>In personality research, the “lexical hypothesis” refers to a hypothesis attributed to Francis Galton (1884). Galton supposed that each human language would reflect important realities of human character within that language and culture. In particular, he noted that the words used to evaluate character and personality are very numerous (he estimated over a thousand, using a thesaurus), and often overlap in meaning.</p>
<p>But Galton immediately left his thesaurus behind, readily admitting of the impossibility of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/26/words-fail/">defining</a> any aspect of character. Rather, he turned to experimental means of testing the character in various ways, and insisted that <em>no particular map or model of personality is needed to start from</em>.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his essay does Galton propose surveys as a means for studying character. He would probably regard such methods as unscientific, as indicated in his final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracter ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalisation is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalise. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man’s conduct in small every-day affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The methods that Galton proposed are exclusively non-linguistic. For instance, he commented that observing children involved in play quickly gives one an idea of each child’s emotional expression. Galton’s proposed methods prefigure both hidden camera prank shows and Goffman’s “breaching experiments:”</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not attempt to describe particular games of children or of others, nor to suggest experiments, more or less comic, that might be secretly made to elicit the manifestations we seek, as many such will occur to ingenious persons. They exist in abundance, and I feel sure that if two or three experimenters were to act zealously and judiciously together as secret accomplices, they would soon collect abundant statistics of conduct. They would gradually simplify their test conditions and extend their scope, learning to probe character more quickly and from more of its sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other methods Galton expressed enthusiasm for include heart rate measurement (he wore a home-brew heart-rate-measuring apparatus while he delivered the lecture that makes up the text) and methods discoverable from personal context (giving an example from Benjamin Franklin, of a man with one attractive and one deformed leg, who kept track of which leg his interlocutors paid attention to, as a gauge of their optimism or pessimism). Galton would be surprised, I think, to find that the most promising and scientific theory of personality in the twenty-first century is premised entirely on survey responses as its “facts.”</p>
<p>Early in the study of personality, there was a major shift of meaning in the lexical hypothesis. At first, the thesaurus and the word list were its tools of study (e.g., Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936); the idea was to find common factors of meaning in the words themselves. Of course, there is no particularly scientific way to decide how much the word “annoying” is the same as “obnoxious,” or how much either is the same as “low-status.” The major shift was to begin to measure the correlations of an entirely different construct: the correlations of the words <em>when used to describe a particular person</em>. That is, rather than trying to measure the underlying meaning of words, researchers began to measure the degree to which different words were applied to the same person. “Sameness” and “correlation” were no longer distinguishable concepts for the methods.</p>
<p>Initially, lists of adjectives, and eventually, short survey questions, were administered to subjects, who described either a person they knew or themselves. When the responses were subjected to factor analysis—a mathematical analysis to reveal the structure of correlations between responses—a varying number of factors emerged, depending on the methods and the researchers and the questions and the subjects, and these factors were given varying names. Since the early 1990s, the Five Factor Model has been dominant, although the names of the factors vary somewhat even today. The acronym OCEAN is used for the traits: Openness to experience (sometimes called “intellect” or “imagination” or “open-mindedness”), Conscientiousness, Extraversion (sometimes called “surgency”), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes called “negative emotionality” or “emotional stability” reversed).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today, the five traits are measured with various survey instruments, with five questions on the shortest version (one for each aspect) and sixty questions on a common long-form version (that used by Soto, 2019). Survey instruments are validated in a number of ways: how much their responses correlate between testings (test-retest reliability, with astrological sign as the gold standard), how much different raters agree using the criteria (inter-rater reliability), and a nebulous concept of construct validity, which sometimes includes scientific gestures designed to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Many papers present elaborate numerical artifacts of validation, and I have found that some characterize the validity of their instruments as “good” without providing an indication of what would be “not good enough.” From a brief review of dozens of validated instruments in social psychology, it seems to me that it is relatively easy to “validate” meaningless instruments. As long as the mathematical bona fides are present, the construct need not be meaningful in other ways. (The reader who is rightly suspicious of my broad and unsourced claims may wish to search Google Scholar with variations of “scale,” “inventory,” and “survey instrument,” and examine the results critically. The naming of factors is often a particularly interesting step.)</p>
<p>The strong claim made by advocates of the Five Factor Model is that any set of questions describing a human being, administered to subjects and the responses subjected to factor analysis, will reveal the same five factors (paraphrasing Jordan Peterson in <a href="https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, around 11:10-16:40). This strong claim, though dubious in a number of respects, is a major part of the basis for the scientific legitimacy of the Big Five. It is interesting to see which aspects of the strong claim are admitted to be false by advocates of the Big Five, and how much is excused on the grounds that <i>at least it’s something</i>. The Five Factor Model is not perfect, advocates grant, but it is better than nothing. It is not clear how they measure “better than nothing;” this is a potentially interesting hypothesis in need of precisification, perhaps.</p>
<p>The Big Five exist as a special, scientifically validated property of language and survey methods, and that is one basis for their legitimacy. The other basis for the legitimacy of the Five Factor Model is its <i>replicable correlation with consequential life outcomes</i>. We know that the Big Five are not merely phantoms that fall out of a certain analysis of a certain use of language in WEIRD college students, because these traits are reliably correlated with things we care about.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the Big Five is the nature of its scientific evidence. Observe what is held out as a “replication” of the theory, and you will discover the theory’s true nature. The most impressive aspect of the ongoing accomplishment of the Five Factor Model is the degree to which it <i>deflects curiosity </i>about its underlying meaning with <i>rituals of scientific validation</i>, regardless of the rituals’ appropriateness in context. Since “replication” is the scientific ritual most recently shown to detect poor science in psychology, being shown to reliably “replicate” is a huge boost to the credibility of a theory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Five Factor Model is what it gets away with, in terms of being considered a theory, even though it is not causal, and makes no predictions. What counts as a “replication” of the Five Factor Model, as in Soto (2019), is the following: a correlation is found between one or more factors of the Five Factor Model and some other construct, and that correlation is found again in another sample, regardless of the size of the correlation. In almost all cases, and in 100% of Soto (2019)’s measures, the construct compared to a Big Five factor is derived from an online survey instrument.</p>
<p>What counts as a “consequential life outcome” is also fascinating. In most cases, the life outcome constructs are vague abstractions measured with survey instruments, much like the Big Five themselves. For instance, the life outcome “Inspiration” is measured with the Inspiration Scale, which asks the subject in four ways how often and how deeply inspired they are. Amazingly, this scale correlates a little bit with Extraversion and with Open-mindedness. Do these personality traits “predict” the life outcome of inspiration? Is “Inspiration” as instrumentalized here meaningfully different from the Big Five constructs, such that this correlation is meaningful?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Compare the items for the construct “Inspiration” with the items for Extraversion and Open-mindedness used in Soto (2019):</p>
<p><b>Inspiration Scale Items</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I experience inspiration.</li></ul></div></article></div>

<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/21/us/when-does-the-decade-end-begin-trnd/index.html">Regardless of whether it's the end of the calendar decade or not</a> it's the end of a programming decade for me. I started early in 2010 and since then I've been programming almost every day, including weekends and vacations. This was a really exciting period in my life and I realized that it's been a while since 2010 only recently. So, I decided to put into words some of my learnings from that time. Warning: the content of this article is highly opinionated and extremely subjective.

<h2 id="combine-object-oriented-procedural-and-functional-programming-techniques">Combine object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming techniques</h2>
<p><i>OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.</i></p>
<p><i>–– Dr. Alan Kay</i></p>


<p>Object-oriented programming seems to be a prevalent technique these days. Different people hear different things when one says <em>object-oriented</em>. I personally don't treat inheritance and polymorphism as necessary attributes of object-orientation. However, hiding and protection of the state by providing public methods is the mandatory attribute of the approach to me. Entities combining the hidden state with the public methods are called objects and they communicate with each other by sending messages (i.e. invoking the public methods of other objects). Most probably, this definition of OOP is too narrow, but these aspects seem the most practical and useful to me. I try to employ them to express any <em>suitable</em> problem in code.</p>
<p>However, the keyword in the previous paragraph is <em>suitable</em>. Yes, there are problems that fit well into the OO-paradigm. For instance, consider the <em>vector</em> - an abstract data structure solving <em>the dynamic array</em> problem:</p>
<pre><code>class Vector&lt;T&gt; {
    private int size;
    private int capacity;
    private T items;

    public Vector(int capacity) {
        this.size = 0;
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.items = new T[capacity];
    }

    public int size() {
        return this.size;
    }

    public void push(T elem) {
        if (this.size == this.capacity) {
            this.realloc();
        }
        this.items[this.size++] = elem;
    }

    private realloc();

    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The <em>vector</em> hides its state (current size, current capacity, etc) and allows the modification only through its public interface. Thus, assuming the proper implementation, the consistency of the state is maintained constantly.</p>
<p>However, not every problem can be easily designed in terms of objects and their communications. And I'm not talking here about some specific domains. Consider the very common problem of registering a new user:</p>
<pre><code>def register_user(name, email):
    user = User(name, email)

    user_repo.save(user)
    start_trial_period(user)
    schedule_welcome_email(user)

    # etc, etc...

    return user</code></pre>
<p>What kind of object should be the owner of the <code>register_user()</code> method? Early at my programming career, I would argue that there should exist a <em>registration service</em> class. However, what's about its state? What attributes should the registration service possess? Are we modifying its state by registering a new user?</p>
<p>Another time, you can find yourself writing a method which performs some computation related to the current class but without accessing its attributes:</p>
<pre><code>class HttpClient:
    def __init__(self, foo, bar, baz, ...):
        pass

    def request(self, url, query, headers, etc, attempts=1):
        for c in range(attempts):
            resp = self._do_request(url, query, headers, etc)
            if is_fine(resp):
                return resp

            self.sleep(self._backoff_delay(c))

        raise Exception('HTTP request failed')

    def _backoff_delay(self, attempt_no):
        return min(1000, 100 * (attempt_no + 1))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>_backoff_delay</code> method can easily be just a self-sufficient function. And there is a huge benefit of having this function separate from the class - its testing becomes much simpler. If the function stayed a method, in order to test the backoff delay computation algorithm we would need to create an instance of the <code>HttpClient</code> supplying all its dependencies (and probably the dependencies of the dependencies) as well as the fake HTTP request parameters. With the pure function we can just do:</p>
<pre><code>assert _backoff_delay(0) == 100
assert _backoff_delay(1) == 200
assert _backoff_delay(10) == 1000</code></pre>
<p>So, eventually, I came to a conclusion, that from time to time it's absolutely fine to have just a function performing some logic. Quoting the gorgeous <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/"><em>Zen of Python</em></a> –– [...] practicality beats purity. <a href="https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2012/stop-writing-classes.html">Stop writing classes</a> for the sake of having classes. Use classes (or objects) only, if the problem fits well into the OO-paradigm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">Procedural programming</a> is a valid and very powerful technique.</p>
<p>I confess, that for a long time I was biased toward the pure OO, ignoring and avoiding other approaches. Accepting the procedural style helped me to become a better programmer. At least I hope so.</p>
<p>However, during my career, I met quite a few developers with the opposite skewness. People have been applying procedural programming even for tasks when one can benefit from the OO-paradigm a lot:</p>
<pre><code>interface Player {
    cursed: boolean;
    scores: number;
}

function collectCoint(p: Player) {
    if (!p.cursed) {
        p.scores += 100;
    }
}

function killMonster(p: Player, m: Monster) {
    if (!p.cursed) {
        p.scores += m.rank;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We have a struct <code>Player</code> here and all its attributes are public. We also have a bunch of business logic functions, performing some game actions. These functions are so easy to test. Forge a fresh player object, pass it into the function and check the attributes afterward. However, there is a problem with this approach. Imagine, we added a new function:</p>
<pre><code>function savePrincess(p: Player) {
    p.scores += 100500;
}</code></pre>
<p>It's so easy to forget about the <code>is cursed</code> check. Thus, we broke the game logic by violating the consistency of the player's state. Having an OO-implementation of the player would allow us to avoid such a pitfall:</p>
<pre><code>class Player {
    addScores(score: number) {
        if (!this.cursed) {
            this.score += number;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>So, how to decide between these two techniques? My personal waymark is a potential violation of the incapsulation. If I see a publicly exposed state and a number of functions here and there modifying it, I will immediately factor it out to a class. In all the other cases, the procedural approach is superior due to its simplicity.</p>
<p>But what's about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">the functional programming paradigm</a>? I incorporated it in my style on a lower-level. If my strategy is rather based on a mix of object-oriented and structural approaches, my tactic is based on functional methods. Compare the following implementations of a hypothetical <code>revenue</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>function revenue(orders) {
    let total = 0;
    for (const o of orders) {
        if (o.paid) {
            total += o.price;
        }
    }
    return total * fee;
}

// vs

function revenue(orders) {
    return _.sum(orders.filter(x =&gt; x.paid).map(x =&gt; x.price)) * fee;
}</code></pre>
<p>Due to its declarative form, the second version is much shorter. It even resembles the human-readable text. One can read it as <code>a sum of all paid order prices multiplied by the fee rate</code>.</p>
<p>Let's try to go one step further:</p>
<pre><code>function promoEligible(user, orders, etc...) {
    let total = 0;
    for (const o of orders) {
        if (o.paid) {
            total += o.price;
        }
    }

    if (total == 0) {
        return false;
    }


    // ...
    // do 42 more checks before returning true.
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>If we follow the imperative way here, the <code>total</code> variable will stay around until the very end of our function even though it was needed only at the very beginning. This increases the mental load, especially when I need to read this code a month later. I'd rewrite it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function promoEligible(user, orders, etc...) {
    return orders.some(x =&gt; x.paid)
        &amp;&amp; anotherCheck(user)
        &amp;&amp; oneMoreCheck(etc);
}</code></pre>
<p>No single extra local variables have been introduced on the <code>promoEligible()</code> level.</p>
<p>I'd not call this technique full-fledged functional programming. It's rather an excerpt of some techniques. Once I started writing code in this way, I rarely can find for-loops in my code, my utility functions tend to be smaller and <em>pure</em> (i.e. avoiding mutation of their arguments, as well as any other side-effects) and my variables - to be immutable. And for some reason, I feel safer and sleep better.</p>
<p>I came to this technique rather intuitively, but it seems that modern languages like Rust are trying to make these patterns the first-class citizens. Variables in Rust are immutable by default and almost every statement in Rust is an expression, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>let res = match compute_something() {
    VeryGood(x) =&gt; 5 * x,
    GoodEnough(x) =&gt; 2 * x,
};</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>std::iter::Iterator</code></a> trait, it's full of map-reduce alike methods:</p>
<pre><code>let a = [0i32, 1, 2];
let mut iter = a.iter().filter(|x| x.is_positive());

let a = [1, 2, 3];
let mut iter = a.iter().map(|x| 2 * x);

let a = [1, 2, 3];
let (even, odd): (Vec&lt;i32&gt;, Vec&lt;i32&gt;) = a
    .iter()
    .partition(|&amp;n| n % 2 == 0);

let a = [1, 2, 3];
let sum: i32 = a.iter().sum();</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html">error handling</a> and the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html"><em>optional</em></a> value also support functional-alike styles, not only in Rust, but in modern Java as well:</p>
<pre><code>Optional.ofNullable(smth).orElseThrow(NullPointerException::new);</code></pre>
<h2 id="use-fewer-local-variables">Use fewer local variables</h2>
<p>In my opinion, variables increase the mental load by introducing extra state and decreasing the expressiveness of the code, making it lower-level. And eventually, they complicate the refactoring.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unpopular opinion: variables (even immutable) are harmful. Try to avoid them in your code. Functional programming techniques and decomposition often helps. Unnecessary variables are evil!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/programming?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#programming</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stateless?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#stateless</a></p>— Ivan Velichko (@iximiuz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1194141015919210496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2019</a></blockquote> 

<p>Imagine, you have a function with two local variables:</p>
<pre><code>function doStuff() {
    // ...

    const color = pickColor();
    const temperature = measureTemperature();

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>There is no direct evidence that Thomas Watson, Sr. predicted in 1943 that there would be “a world market for five computers”. First, he probably didn’t know about computers back then: in the 1940s computers were classified research projects at the UK Government Code and Cipher School and the US Army, while Watson’s IBM were famously <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ibm-holocaust_b_1301691">involved with the other side</a> during the war. Second, it’s just not something there’s evidence of him talking about. When IBM presented plans for their early commercial computers to various businesses, they got about ten immediate sign-ups and as many expressions of interest. That’s already a market for twenty computers. Various people in government on both sides of the pond, including the UK National Physical Laboratory’s head Sir Charles Darwin (grandson of the one you’ve heard of), may have said that their respective government’s <em>laboratory</em> needs could be satisfied by a small number of computers, but these seem to be estimates of immediate resource usage rather than predictions of future market growth.</p>
<p>Like the 640k RAM thing attributed to Bill Gates, the five computers quote seems to be a fabrication from a later age, invented to teach us a lesson about the futility of grand predictions. It’s a shame, though, because the five computers prediction looks like it may come true very soon.</p>
<p>Through a combination of adoption of virtualisation technologies (theoretically improving the portability of software deployments) and consolidation onto a small number of providers (practically ensuring that no such portability occurs), three of the five computers can easily be identified. Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft each run one of the world’s three largest commercial computer-time rental businesses. Their three CFOs each centrally command an economy worth in the region of $1T (particular quotes taken from Yahoo! Finance on 14th June valued Amazon at $1.27T, Alphabet at $0.96T, and Microsoft at $1.42T), though as we shall soon see it’s probably best to see them as department heads of a single multi-trillion global computer economy encompassing the three businesses and more. To put that into comparison with other planned economies, the Soviet Union reached a GDP of $1T in 1979 and $2T before its dissolution a little over a decade later.</p>
<p>So which computers are fourth and fifth in the global market? Certainly none of the other cloud providers, who are all tiny in comparison. The closest runner is Alibaba ($0.58T), but forget the other western runners, Oracle ($0.16T) and IBM ($0.11T). They can both be seen as attempts to extract rental income from their existing hardware platforms – SPARC and RS6000/Power, respectively.</p>
<p>And talking of RISC CPU designs leads us to disregard another wannabe competitor who’d definitely <em>like</em> to be in the big five, but seems destined to come crashing back down to the ground. As excitement mounts over whether certain high-profile computer vendors may switch to using the ARM CPU design in their systems, ARM sales and revenue are down and parent company Softbank is suffering losses, too (both directly, and its $100B Vision Development Fund). ARM’s heritage is in desktop and mobile computing (the chip was designed to run the Acorn Archimedes line of personal computers, and when ARM was spun out of Acorn they received funding from Apple to develop chips for the Newton line of handheld computers). This is clearly a market that current CEO, Simon Segars, sees as legacy business, the cash cow that he can squeeze to fund his real interest in the Internet of Things. Thus ARM’s new goal, to enable “a trillion connected devices”.</p>
<p>You could see Softbank’s pattern of investments as an attempt to create that fourth computer in the market of five, the distributed computer of things. Whether you’re in the office (Slack, We), at home (Grofers, FirstCry, OpenDoor), or inbetween (Cambridge Mobile Telematics, Mapbox, GetAround), Softbank are hoping that you’re connected to Masa’s computer. Their particular choices, and scattergun approach, mean that this is unlikely to coalesce within the funds and time available to Softbank. It’s unlikely that they’d take ARM down with them before someone stepped in to buy it out. Which brings us on to the <em>real</em> contender for the world’s fourth computer:</p>
<p>Apple. The Apple cloud is a computer that contains a lot of music, TV shows, movies, games, books, news reports, and storage space that users of Apple’s consumer electronics can rent access on. As a cross-selling deal, a small amount of access is offered with the sale of each of the consumer devices. Unlike the other three computers we’ve seen so far (Amazon’s, Alphabet’s, and Microsoft’s), you can’t rent time directly on the Apple computer to run your own code. You can upload your own software, but you rely on people discovering and choosing to run it themselves. The execution is actually done on the end devices, not on the Apple computer, though the documents people create may be synced via the Apple computer. By the way, Apple’s planned economy currently amounts to $1.47T.</p>
<p>You may notice that described this way, the Apple computer sounds a lot like the Ethereum computer, and expect me to suggest that it’s the fifth computer, or maybe the bitcoin computer, but no. It’s the Facebook computer. Like the four previously mentioned, the Facebook computer is a huge distributed computer with billions of users, running lots of different applications. Like the Apple computer, you can’t just run your own code on the Facebook computer (well you <em>can</em> run games), but that doesn’t matter, because most people use computers for the same reasons. The big feature of the Facebook computer is the contacts app, which has about a third of the world’s population on.</p>
<p>Those are the five computers of the world market, together directly controlling $5.8T of the world’s assets, roughly 2/3 the value of the total amount of gold in the world. Indirectly, their influence through app stores, subscription fees, software providers who are dependent on their services, resellers and so on is significantly larger.</p>
<p>And it’s important to consider them together, because the veneer of competing in an open market only goes so deep. Look at any relevant trade association and you’ll see the trillion-dollar computer vendors working together toward their common interests, for example the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Softbank ARM, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, others), or the Linux Foundation (Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Alibaba, Facebook, Amazon, Softbank ARM, others). There is really one central computing economy, controlling well over six trillion dollars of technology investment, with five different public faces.</p>
<p>How did the market for computers get consolidated to this extent? It certainly wasn’t inevitable. Early examples of outsourced computing were advantageous because the hardware was so expensive, needed specialist and frequent handling, and there just wasn’t much of it about. Those early IBM systems that Watson found more than five customers for could be rented for around $12k-18k per <em>month</em>, so you had to be sure that your computing job was going to save a few people’s salaries before you even ran it in the cloud.</p>
<p>Where companies did invest in computing hardware, offering the platform as a service to others help to offset the purchase and development costs. The first commercial computer in the UK was the Lyons Electronic Office I, developed from the EDSAC machine by food producer Lyons. LEO/I also ran payroll for Ford UK, and weather simulations for the Met Office (until they bought their own Ferranti computer). It was in use between the 1950s and the 1980s, demonstrating great longevity in the days before planned obsolence.</p>
<p>During those decades, the smaller size of components, greater reliability, lower costs, improved usability and application combined with the business vision of key people who set out to provide “a computer on every desktop”. Rather than a small number of computers becoming more capable, capabilities became more widespread, more distributed, more affordable, and more accessible. Computers shrank in size and cost until every office building, every cubicle, every home, eventually every pocket could contain one.</p>
<p>None of the technical, physical or practical trends described above have reversed to lead to the cloud computing consolidation we see today, and the world market for five computers. The only change that can account for this behaviour is the business vision, and the direction in which the cadre of executives take their companies.</p>
<p>Since the dot com crash of 1999-2001, investors have looked to seed companies with the smallest amount of money possible to lead to either a rapid collapse or rapid growth supported by multiple follow-on investment rounds until an eventual exit. Hockey-stick charts, “disruption”, “MVPs”, “growth hacking”, “fail fast” are not neutral business advice, but a particular way of working designed to minimise risk and maximise payoff for a small clique of rich investors who expect the money they lend out to work its way back into the system – perhaps through cloud subscription fees paid to companies they hold positions in. Don’t go buying expensive capital investments like offices, desks or computers when you can rent them…from us.</p>
<p>This has led to the situation where computing applications are architected with the goal of rapidly meeting the goal of tomorrow’s investor presentation, regardless of the effect this has on the later costs or usability of the product. One workload I now support would cost an estimated £6000 per month to run on one of the large cloud providers, which would allow me to purchase the actual hardware in use four times over every year. But “spinning up an instance” today using free credits means you can worry about that cost later, whereas ordering a box from Dell means waiting two to three business days by which …</p></div></div>

July 6, 2020 | https://optidash.ai/blog/optimizing-images-on-the-worlds-top-100-websites | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://optidash.ai/blog/optimizing-images-on-the-worlds-top-100-websites">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The world’s most visited websites receive insane amounts of traffic and push petabytes of data to visitors all around the globe. Because images alone represent over 60% of today’s Internet traffic, one would think that the top 100 websites would keep their images as light as possible. At the end of the day, saving millions of dollars in yearly bandwidth and storage fees seems like a good strategy. Let’s find out how well visual content is treated on these websites.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>The only 100% reliable way to fetch all images from those websites is by using a real browser on a desktop machine. That’s why we’ve manually crawled websites in this test and exported all network activity as HAR files. While Puppeteer with <code>stealth</code> plugin and an auto-rotating proxy seems to produce acceptable results for the majority of use cases, we wanted to be absolutely sure we’re getting all visuals. Test results are only as good as the input data used to compute them.</p><p>Collected HAR files were loaded to and parsed in our test application. We then extracted all requests with a matching <code>image/*</code> mime type and discarded those with body length less than 100 bytes as those were mainly 1x1 GIF tracking pixels.</p><p>One of the major benefits of recording and using HAR files is that all binary responses are already <code>base64</code>-encoded right into them so we only had to load them into temporary buffers and save the binaries to disk:</p><pre><code>(async () =&gt; {
    const src = Buffer.from(response.content.text, "base64");

    try {
        await fs.writeFile(`./sites/${site_name}/images/${file_name}`, src);
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }

In total, we’ve collected and optimized <strong>8353 images</strong> and saved <strong>32.61% of the initial file size</strong>.</p><p>The actual optimization and recompression results were measured using the following formula:</p><pre><code>100 * (original_size - optimized_size) / original_size</code></pre><h2>Image formats</h2><p>JPEG is still the most commonly used image format with a 53% share followed by PNG (23%) and WebP (16%). It’s worth noting that on some websites, most notably StackOverflow, Amazon AWS, and Atlassian, SVGs are used almost exclusively.</p><div><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/optimization-stats-q2-2020/image-formats.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/optimization-stats-q2-2020/image-formats@2x.png 2x" width="313"></figure></div><h2>JPEG images</h2><ul><li>The most commonly used (24% of all the JPEGs) encoding quality is <code>87</code> followed by <code>77</code> (8.6%) and <code>100</code> (8.3%).</li><li><strong>Only 31%</strong> of JPEG images use progressive coding.</li><li><code>4:2:0</code> is the most commonly used sampling scheme (69%) followed by <code>4:4:4</code> (30%) and <code>4:2:2</code> (1%)</li></ul><p>The stats above show great potential for further reducing the file size of JPEG images. Progressive coding along with <code>4:2:0</code> sampling scheme and ideal Q value predicted on a per-image basis will yield enormous savings.</p><h2>WebP images</h2><p>Exactly 33.33% of the top 100 websites use WebP on as a primary image format. It’s good to see more developers decide to go the extra mile and ensure WebP variants of their website’s visual content. But serving WebP images is one thing and optimizing them is something they should consider. We’ve been able to further optimize all of the WebP content using a near-lossless algorithm and saw substantial savings there.</p><h2>Interesting stats</h2><ul><li>The total weight of visual content across all 100 websites is <strong>228.96MB</strong>.</li><li>The website with the largest number of images (397) is <a href="https://www.rakuten.co.jp/">Rakuten</a>.</li><li>The website with the heaviest visual content (11.1MB) is <a href="https://www.sina.com.cn/">Sina</a>.</li><li>The top five heaviest images were served on Sina (<a href="https://n.sinaimg.cn/tech/510/w343h167/20200630/9c8b-ivrxcex7479562.gif">3.7MB</a>), Reddit (<a href="https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2x4yx/styles/communityIcon_ex5aikhvi3i41.png">3.6MB</a>), IMDB (<a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3YjUxMGYtNDZmMC00ZTVlLTg5MjgtOTU2MGNkNDhlMGI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._CR515,799,4800,2700.jpg">3.0MB</a>), Office (<a href="https://blobs.officehome.msocdn.com/images/content/images/office-apps-347d86a528.gif">2.8MB</a>) and BBC (<a href="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/original/p08hn1gz.jpg">1.9MB</a>).</li></ul><h2>Detailed results</h2><p>Below we present a detailed list of the top 100 websites along with optimization results.

<h2>Preface to this blog post</h2>



<p>Why review a book from the hand of a notorious terrorist who killed three and maimed dozens of people? That seems like the right question to answer before continuing this blog post. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">Theodore J. Kaczynski</a> is an extremely intelligent yet wounded man. He’s been a victim of cold-war era social experiments and, throughout his life, has always been an outsider. He retreated from society and lived like a hermit in the woods in Montana. Nevertheless, he was an activist in search of attention for his ideology and manifesto.</p>



<p>Numerous human lives have been sacrificed on the altars of freedom, ideology, and a better world. Wherever you position yourself on the political spectrum, from left to right, your heroes have blood on their hands. Reagan, Lenin, Bush, Mao, Napoleon, Robespierre, Obama, Chavez, Macron, Selassie, and Guevara, in one way or another, are responsible for the death and suffering of many. Yet we read their memoirs, manifestoes, and biographies. We have their posters on the walls of our children’s rooms. In this light, <strong>the refusal to read and review <em>Industrial Society and its Future</em> would be an act of hypocrisy. </strong></p>



<p>Finally, the central claim that technology is inherently bad for society is of relevance to this blog. I completely distance myself from the man’s actions, but his manifesto definitely struck a chord. I currently cannot think of a better way to scrutinize my techno-optimism than to write about it.</p>



<h2>The Power Process</h2>



<p><em>Industrial Society and its Future</em> is an essay of 232 numbered paragraphs in which Kaczynski explains what’s wrong with society, how it should be, and how we can get there. The most interesting parts of the essay describe the core concept of the <em>Power Process</em>, its consequences, and how technology has an impact on it.</p>



<p><strong>Human drives</strong> can be classified in three broad categories:</p>



<ul><li>Drives that can be satisfied with minimal effort: a walk around the block.</li><li>Drives that can be satisfied at the cost of serious effort: chopping down a tree for burning wood.</li><li>Drives that cannot be satisfied, no matter the effort one puts in it: somersault from a high cliff and survive it</li></ul>



<p>Kaczynski claims that <strong>all humans need a power process</strong>: (1) we all need goals, (2) effort to attain them, and (3) the attainment of some of these goals. Finally, it requires a degree of (4) autonomy. Consequently, the power process is part of the second category of human drives.</p>



<p>If unattained goals result in death, they are important. If the non-attainment of one’s goals is compatible with survival (i.e. not important), it will lead to defeatism, low self-esteem, and depression (as I explain later on). In the Western world, one only needs minimum effort to survive. Satisfying biological needs has been reduced to triviality. One can live off welfare checks, or have a bullshit job to satisfy physical needs. The only thing required is a minimal degree of obedience. Humans have given up autonomy and effort to attain the needs to survive — the important goals.  That’s why humans artificially create the four components of the power process for themselves: they are involved in <strong>surrogate activities</strong>: long-distance running, blogging, collecting stamps, gardening and even pursuing an academic career. </p>



<h2>Technology messes with the power process</h2>



<p>Kaczynski distinguishes between <strong>two kinds of technology</strong>: The first one is <strong>small-scale technology</strong>, like a mill or a water wheel. The second kind is <strong>organization-dependent technology</strong> that requires large-scale social organization: A refrigerator depends on complicated and industrially created parts and requires electricity. The first kind can produce real progress and freedom. The second kind has a negative impact on our freedom: the externalities outweigh the benefits. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">the prisoner’s dilemma</a> on a global scale.</p>



<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, most new technologies are of the second kind. The wave of <em>smart</em> and <em>connected</em> devices and software that’s heading our way is no different. Algorithms can curate all available information on our timelines, only inviting more and more (fake?) articles to be produced. Autonomous cars are safer and offer the freedom to keep the hands of the wheel. Yet as self-driving cars are simply sensors on wheels, you will have zero privacy regarding your location. Self-service checkouts are supposed to be faster. Yet as supermarket customers more often use them, fewer registers with cashiers will be available, reducing human personal contact. Oh, and you need a loyalty card, which is digital-only, for which you need a smartphone.</p>



<p>Social and psychological problems arise when humans cannot go through the power process. <strong>In modern society, technology (especially of the second kind) tends to push drives into the first group</strong>: gathering food is now <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/">one tap away</a>.  Intimacy can be achieved by <a href="https://tinder.com/">swiping</a> or paying a <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/live">minimum fee</a>. Leisure can be found on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/be-en/">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. Turn up the heat by asking your <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_thermostats">Nest</a>. </p>



<p>On the other hand,<strong> technology also moved other drives into the third category</strong>. With urbanization reaching record numbers; experiencing authenticity, harmony, nature, silence, and clean air is nearly impossible for many inhabitants of this planet.</p>



<p><strong>Some important goals that remain in the second category, like achieving status, can no longer be done autonomously</strong>. To reach the highest echelons of the corporate ladder, one needs to adhere to company culture, engage in networking, and pass opaque assessments. A management position is often at the goodwill of another manager, higher up.</p>



<p>The primitive man only had to fear disease and certain aspects of the environment. He could accept this stoically, or invent gods and demons. But these problems weren’t man-made, imposed on them by someone’s decision which he had no impact on. Although many of us create them for themselves, for others,<strong> surrogate activities do not suffice. The results are aggression, mental breakdowns, burnouts, depressions, mid-life crises, and declining fertility.</strong> As decisions are increasingly outsourced to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing"><em>trustworthy </em>and <em>unbiased</em> machines</a> — think<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/technology/facial-recognition-police.html"> facial recognition by police departments</a>, or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/01/21/137783/algorithms-criminal-justice-ai/">algorithms sending people to jail</a> — hopelessness and rebellion will only increase.</p>



<p>In modern society, mental health is defined by how one behaves in accord with the needs of the system.</p>



<h2>Technology is a rational response to problems</h2>



<p>A compromise between freedom and technology is impossible because technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom. That’s because each new technology appears to be desirable<strong> and only threatens our freedom later on</strong>. Motorized transport allows us to travel a lot farther. Yet once the adoption of cars reaches a critical threshold, one is <em>expected</em> to own a car: Local shops and public services disappear and become centralized in malls and government buildings. The internet allowed us to communicate with each other faster than ever. As companies adopted the internet, one can no longer apply for a job without an internet connection. Technology changes society as to make itself indispensable.</p>



<p>The following words read like a prophecy: “<em>Generally speaking, <strong>technological control over human behavior will probably not be introduced with a totalitarian intention</strong> or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom. Each new step in the assertion of control over the humankind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces society…”</em></p>



<p>For example, society has given up privacy to battle COVID-19 with apps and track&amp;trace strategies. Facebook promised us freedom of speech and unlimited reach, but without the financial means, you’re <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-algorithm/">shouting in a vacuum</a>. The Patriot Act (and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act">mass surveillance technology</a> that came with it) was designed to battle terrorism but introduced legal arbitrariness. These three examples were all <strong>rational responses to existing problems but produced unforeseen externalities</strong>.</p>



<p>As technology makes itself indispensable, machines will take care of more and more tasks and “<em>on those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed: the will need more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more reliable, conforming and docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism.</em>“</p>



<p>Think of the swarm of Uber or Lyft drivers who took a short training on how to use the app and are now driving people around in servile silence. Their data feeds the algorithm, and the algorithm thinks for them. <strong>The only thing left is to abide by the system.</strong></p>



<h2>Revolution</h2>



<p>Which brings us to Kaczynski’s “solution”. This topic lacks the depth and cunning analogies that can be found in the earlier chapters. His recipes aren’t new: one can find elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin">Bakunist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony">Gramscist</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foco">Debrayist</a> thinking.</p>



<p>Because technology is the strongest social force, <strong>gradual change is impossible</strong>. The only way to break this circle, this slippery slope to servitude to the machine, is a revolution. While the system might collapse under its own internal difficulties, Kaczynski claims we should promote social stress and instability in industrial society. Humanity should return to nature to live in small groups and to be in control of life-and-death issues: food, clothing, shelter, and defense. This is true freedom: the power to control the circumstances of one’s own life. It’s not an ideology, it’s Nature with a big N:</p>



<p><em>“We have no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. Our goal is only to destroy the existing form of society.”</em></p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Manifestos are always dull, so I didn’t expect this book to be an enjoyable read. But quite a lot of insights were so masterfully crafted, that I often had to allow my mind to wander off in a quest to find (counter-)examples and arguments to what I just read. If you’re into political theory, this will be a treat.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the structure of the book and the order of the chapters seemed strange to …</p></div></div>

        <p><img src="https://www.bluespace.tech/blog/0password/forgot-password.png"></p>
        <p>A few months ago, Scott Stein shared an article on CNet, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/password-managers-great-until-you-lose-access-world-password-day/">Password managers are great -- until you lose your password manager password</a>. Many people shared and retweeted the article. You know that feeling if you ever lost the password to your password manager.</p>
        <h2 id="why-do-password-managers-require-a-master-password">Why do password managers require a master password?</h2>
        <p>The earliest first generation password managers can manage passwords, by keeping them somewhere, but not protect them well.</p>
        <p>About 20 years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> was recommended as a standard. It transforms a simple password into a complex key which can be used in cryptographic algorithms.</p>
        <p>Since then, lots of second and third generation password managers have been emerging. They derive encryption key from master password, then encrypt user data with the key. This is how it works:</p>
        <pre>            <code><p>graph TD

            subgraph 1. key derivation

            password --&gt; PBKDF2(PBKDF2)
            salt --&gt; PBKDF2
            PBKDF2 --&gt;|derive| key[[key]]

            end

            subgraph 2. encryption

            key --&gt; AES(AES)
            plaintext --&gt; AES
            AES --&gt; |encrypt| ciphertext[(ciphertext)]

            end

            style password fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
            style ciphertext fill: #ddd, stroke: #aaa
            style salt fill:#fff
            style plaintext fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
            </p></code>
        </pre>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In cryptography,</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>plaintext</code> is unencrypted data intended to be encrypted;</li>
        <li><code>ciphertext</code> is the output of encryption of <code>plaintext</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To get the <code>plaintext</code> back, password managers derive the key just as above, but perform decrypt operation instead of encrypt operation in the second step.</p>
        <pre>            <code><p>graph TD

            subgraph 1. key derivation

            password --&gt; PBKDF2(PBKDF2)
            salt --&gt; PBKDF2
            PBKDF2 --&gt;|derive| key[[key]]

            end

            subgraph 2. decryption

            key --&gt; AES(AES)
            ciphertext[(ciphertext)] --&gt; AES
            AES --&gt; |decrypt| plaintext

            end

            style password fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
            style salt fill:#fff
            style plaintext fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
            style ciphertext fill:#ddd, stroke: #aaa
            </p></code>

        <p>I will not go deep for it in this article. If you are interested in the details, please checkout this series <a href="https://www.bluespace.tech/blog/evolution-of-password-manager/">The evolution of password manager</a>.</p>
        <p>Essentially, to encrypt user data, password managers must rely on some <strong>secret controlled by the user</strong>, so that hackers cannot get data from the ciphertext.</p>
        <h2 id="secret-in-security-chip">Secret in security chip</h2>

        <p><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce#SecureElement">NFC card emulation with a secure element in Android.</a></p>
        <p>Nowadays, most smartphones, except some low-end ones, are equipped with a dedicated security chip(Trusted Execution Environment, Secure Element, or Secure Enclave in iOS). Emulated payment cards in iPhone and Android wallet apps are secured by this chip.</p>
        <p>Our fourth generation password manager, ID Guard Offline, can be safely used without a master password. The secret for encryption can be secured by the chip which is much more reliable than human brain. Again, if you are interested in how it works, please checkout <a href="https://www.bluespace.tech/blog/evolution-of-password-manager/fourth-generation-password-manager.html">The Evolution of Password Manager (4/4)</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="master-password">Master password</h3>
        <p>Scott Stein, the CNet staff, lost all his passwords because of forgetting master password. It is the nature of the algorithm above. In addition to using security chip protection, ID Guard Offline also offers master password protection (users can choose whether to use it). So our users may also encounter the same problem. We believe that availability is just as important as confidentiality to password managers and we need to resolve that problem.</p>
        <p>Some password manager providers allow user to reset master password, Google for example. If a user can reset master password and continue to view passwords stored previously, then those passwords are not secured by the master password.</p>
        <p>Our team of course do not compromise on security. The master password can never be reset. Then, is it possible to get the master password back when our user cannot recall it?</p>
        <h3 id="find-back-my-password">Find back my password</h3>
        <p>Some social services offer user account recovery with the help of trusted contacts when the user forgets the password. Here is how it works.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The user is required to ask his/her trusted contacts to accomplish some tasks(e.g. sending a code).</li>
        <li>The service detects whether those trusted contacts complete the tasks.</li>
        <li>If so, the service lets the user login and asks he/she to reset password.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inspired by this, we have a simple idea: ask friends to help find password back. And finally, we perfected this design after several iterations.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Ask friends to save my password</p>
            
            <p>The first idea coming into our minds was just asking friends to save the password. When forgetting the password, ask a friend to tell me the password. It's like asking a friend to keep my house keys temporarily.</p>
            
            <p><img src="https://www.bluespace.tech/blog/0password/key.jpg" alt=""></p>
            
            <p>Obviously, this is not safe. Passwords are always meant to be kept secretly. Lots of users reuse their passwords, one leaked password can endanger a large number of accounts.</p>
            

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Encrypt the password then send to friends</p>
            
            <p>Encryption is a good idea. The problem is how to choose/derive the encryption key. We cannot ask user to set another password to encrypt the password, right?</p>
            
            <img src="https://www.bluespace.tech/blog/0password/russian-doll.jpg" alt="">
            
            <p>Stay safe</p>
            
            <p>If the encryption does not depend on user's secret, the encryption key must be hardcoded. We will not make <a href="https://team-sik.org/sik-2016-022/">the same mistake like other password managers did years ago</a>.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Encrypt the password with a key inside the security chip on smartphone, and send only the <code>ciphertext</code> to friends</p>
        <pre>            <code>
                <p>graph TD

                key[[key]] --&gt; AES(AES)
                password --&gt; AES
                AES --&gt;|encrypt| ciphertext[(password file)]

                key --&gt; phone[Secure Element]
                ciphertext --&gt; friend[saved by friend]

                style password fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
                style ciphertext fill: #ddd, stroke: #aaa
                style phone fill: #b3d26a
                style friend fill: #acf
                </p></code>
            </pre>
            <p>In this proposal, a password file(<code>ciphertext</code>) is kept by each friend, but the <code>keys</code> are secured by the security chip on the phone.
            The password can be decrypted if a friend sends back the password file, when finding back the password.</p>
            <pre>                <code><p>graph TD

                subgraph 1. find back password

                masterPasswordKey[[key]] --&gt; masterPasswordAes(AES)
                masterPasswordCiphertext[(password file)] --&gt; masterPasswordAes
                masterPasswordAes --&gt;|decrypt| password

                end

                subgraph 2. key derivation

                password --&gt; PBKDF2(PBKDF2)
                salt --&gt; PBKDF2
                PBKDF2 --&gt;|derive| key[[key]]

                end

                subgraph 3. decryption

                key --&gt; AES(AES)
                ciphertext[(ciphertext)] --&gt; AES
                AES --&gt; |decrypt| plaintext

                end

                style masterPasswordCiphertext fill: #ddd, stroke: #aaa
                style password fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
                style ciphertext fill: #ddd, stroke: #aaa
                style salt fill:#fff
                style plaintext fill:#fff, stroke: #aaa
                </p></code>
            </pre>
        <p>Friends are required to save the password file into ID Guard Offline, which is secured by the security chip on the phone. So hackers cannot steal the password file. This finding back master password mechanism does not weaken the security of the data stored in ID Guard Offline.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If a hacker steals a user's phone and unlocks it(by screen PIN), he/she still needs to enter the master password.
        <ul>
        <li>If the hacker does not know the master password, he/she has to steal and unlock the phone of a friend, and crack ID Guard Offline app on that friend's phone, which is really hard.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If a hacker cracks and gets the password file from a friend, he/she cannot decrypt the ciphertext without the encryption key inside the security chip on the user's phone.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8464"><div><div><div><h2>Researchers find critical flaw in OpenSSH Client versions 5.7 to 8.3 that allows targeted MitM attacks using information leakage in SSH Clients</h2><p>Security researchers from German security firm FZI have found a critical flaw in the OpenSSH Client version 5.7 to 8.3. The critical vulnerability in OpenSSH clients lies due to an information leak in the initial key exchange message of the SSH protocol.</p><p>OpenSSH Client is an SSH client is a program that allows users to establish a secure and authenticated SSH connections to SSH servers. The OpenSSH source code is available free to everyone via the Internet. The devs had released the OpenSSH Client version 8.3 on 27th May 2020. However, the security researchers from FZI say that even the newly released version is susceptible to MITM attack due to the flaw.</p><p>The OpenSSH Client flaw has <strong>Observable Discrepancy</strong> leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). The OpenSSH Client vulnerability has been issued the identifier – <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14145">CVE­-2020-­14145</a> and has a severity score of 4.7/10.</p><p>FZI says that any potential hacker can detect if an SSH client using the default configuration stores a host key for the target server. Once this is detected, the hacker can conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the clients that connect to a server for the first time and avoid clients that would show a warning because of a changed host key. Clients that connect to a server for the first time, ask the user to confirm the fingerprint of the host key. Users that compare the shown fingerprint by a known value are safe.

<p>I have been toying with a theoretical idea for the past 18 months off-and-on in my head and I have not fully articulated it aloud yet. It is regarding the concept of <em>Ownership Semantics</em> (OS) or <em>Move Semantics</em> in programming languages. Fundamentally this article is a criticism of the concept and states that the concept is a duality of traditional OOP but applied to a different area.</p>
<h2 id="general-definitions-of-terminology">General Definitions of Terminology</h2>
<p>A general list of definitions of terminology used within this article in order to minimize confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>Value</em> is a datum with an associated type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>(Data) Type</em> is an attribute of a value which encodes information about how the data value can be operated upon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Object</em> is a value with associated behaviour, and thus implies it has <em>agency</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Class</em> is the data type of an <em>Object</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hierarchy of value ownership is a hierarchy of responsibility of values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Owned-Value</em> is a value which belongs to a hierarchy of value ownership, which implies it is governed by an <em>agent</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Agent</em> is an actor with the capacity to act within a given environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Model of Interpretation</em> is a way to view and analyse a subject</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Paradigm</em> is a way of classifying models of structure of programming languages; a <em>Paradigm</em> is a <em>model of interpretation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> - A paradigm of structuring a program around the sole concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ownership/Move Semantics (OS)</em> - Orientation around responsibility of values in a hierarchical fashion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-object-orientation-paradigm">Foundations of the Object Orientation Paradigm</h2>
<p>Though the original conception of the term coined by Alan Kay<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was never used as he intended it to be, the term <em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> has been commonly understood to be a paradigm of structuring a program around the concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit. Many languages support multiple paradigms, including aspects for the OOP paradigm, but I would class those as multiparadigm rather than being <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most languages implement <em>Objects</em> and <em>Classes</em> in the Simula tradition; most of the notable OOP languages have a similar form by defining methods (member functions) within the class definition. Traditionally languages such as Java can be classed as <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most traditional OOP languages are based around the concept of <em>inheritance</em>, a mechanism of deriving a class data type from another class data type and retaining similar information. Most people generally view inheritance as a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtyping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a> through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables (vtables)</a>. This has lead to many discussions asking whether a language can be called as OOP if it does not support inheritance<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent times, <em>inheritance</em> has been falling out of fashion in favour of <em>composition</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This is mostly due to the issue of conforming a <em>class</em> to a strict (singular) hierarchy of agency when in reality, things can belong to many (if not infinite) categories and hierarchies, as well as another aspect which I will be discussing throughout this article.</p>
<p>There are many criticisms of OOP<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> but my general criticism is that by placing emphasis on trying to solve problem in the type system, it shifts focus from the data structures and algorithms, <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/#the-concept-of-programming">the core of what a program fundamentally is</a>.</p>
<p>Since objects themselves are being treated <em>as if</em> they have behaviour (not just type properties), they are effectively being treated as if they were <em>agents</em> in the program. This mental model has many conclusions, many of which cause issues.</p>
<p>In my article <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/"><em>Pragmatism in Programming Proverbs</em></a>, I state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object orientated programming is a form of misinterpreted and misapplied Aristotelian Metaphysics applied to a domain it was never meant to model</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this statement is that <em>artificially</em> conforming any/all relationships between data and types to an artificial hierarchy of <em>agency</em> is a form of naïve-Aristotelian metaphysics. Since there is no actual <em>agency</em> in the programming objects, it is a partial fallacy. When trying to conform a program to have a particular structure when it does not naturally, the absence of a structure in a program is more useful than a bad structure.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>The concept of adding methods to classes/objects has proven useful to many. The real questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>And how do people actually conceptualize methods on a day-to-day basis?</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people, I am going to bet that methods, in languages with an emphasis on inheritance rather than composition (such as C++ or Java), are treated as a way of categorizing and associating functions/procedures with a data record. There are a few reasons for this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to organize and search for procedures by a data type</li>
<li>Allowing methods as a form of syntactic sugar for writing calls in a <em>subject verb object</em> manner e.g. <code>foo_do_thing(x, y)</code> vs <code>x.do_thing(y)</code></li>
<li>Mental model of behaviour for objects</li>
</ul>
<p>From experience, I have found that long time users of “OOP” languages eventually start treating methods primarily in the first two approaches.</p>
<p>I will not go into depth about the other main aspects of OOP such as encapsulation, local retention, forms of polymorphism, etc, as the hierarchical nature is the fundamental aspect of focus for this article. The (linear) hierarchy of agency is the main problem. The reason why people argue for <em>composition over inheritance</em> is that it flattens this linear hierarchy, reducing its effect. It is the transition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal typing</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural typing</a>, which is more flexible because many data structures and problems have a <em>non-linear</em> nature to them, which <em>linear</em> approaches <strong>cannot</strong> handle. When trying to adhere to the the strict hierarchical type system approaches, it leads to numerous issues because data is more commonly graph-like (non-linear) than tree-like (linear) for most problems. This strict hierarchy does occur with encapsulation at the object level too, a strict hierarchy of messages/references; this hierarchical nature arises from the concept agency itself, inheritance is not the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> Inheritance is not all bad and does have many real life practical uses, but these costs must be known before using them, like with any tool.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> The linearity is with regards to the data structures themselves and not the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-ownership-semantics-paradigm">Foundations of the Ownership Semantics Paradigm</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++11</a> introduced the concept of <em>move semantics</em> or <em>ownership semantics</em> (OS), a way to minimize the copying of data through copy constructors. It utilizes the added concept of r-value references (<code>T &amp;&amp;</code>) as a means to do this. However, the concept began to be used for a lot more than its basic purpose. The concept adds the high level abstraction of “moving” objects rather than “copying” objects. Physically, a computer only ever copies and this high level abstraction, to treat objects <em>as if</em> they were “real objects”, is not what actually happens. It is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake">category error</a> to treat them as “real objects” since “real objects” and “programming objects” have little connection with each other ontologically. When a value or object is “moved”, this means is that the <em>responsibilities</em> of the resources of that object have been transferred to another object or environment—<em>agents</em>. In this case, ownership/move semantics is fundamentally based around the <em>responsibilities of values</em> by tracking value usage.</p>
<p>In this model of agency, the arena of agency can take on many forms, such as blocks, procedure bodies, or aggregate values. Therefore some <em>owned-values</em> also <em>own</em> other values, and thus a value could have agency.</p>
<p>If we were to call Ownership Semantics a paradigm, it would be the orientation around the <em>responsibility of values</em> in a hierarchical fashion, placing emphasis on this system of responsibility, shifting focus from data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>responsibility</em> and <em>ownership</em> is similar to the real world counter parts in that to own something means to have exclusive use and full responsibility over it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a multi-paradigm programming language but at its core is an Ownership-Orientated language. Everything in Rust has a concept of <em>“ownership”</em> and <em>lifetime</em> associated with it. Rust is designed around trying to be first and foremost “safe”, especially with regards to concurrency. Rust derives from the C++ family in terms of philosophy and style, but uses a more <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2018/03/12/on-the-aesthetics-of-the-syntax-of-declarations/">qualifier-focused</a> declaration syntax and many concepts from functional languages from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML family</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lifetimes</em> are theoretically orthogonal to <em>ownership</em> but in practical, they usually are intrinsically coupled. I will not discuss the problems with object-based lifetimes in this article.</p>
<p>The following Rust code can be used to demonstrate this responsibility transfer between different capturing things such as <code>let</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Foo {
	value: i32,
}

fn main() {
	let foo = Foo{value: 123};
	let bar = foo; // the responsibility of `foo` is transferred to `bar`

	println!("{}", foo.value); // error: use of moved value: `foo.value`
	println!("{}", bar.value);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Rust is an immutable-by-default language, with the option to opt into mutability with <code>mut</code>. Immutability helps a lot with mathematical proofs for logic since things things can be “flattened” quite easily, however virtually all computers are fundamentally mutable things, even if the abstraction of immutability is a useful tool. As a result, the ownership semantics system requires a few more rules to take into account mutability, by adding the concept of “borrowing” through references. The general rules for the borrow checker are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value may have as many immutable borrows as you want</li>
<li>Each value may only have one mutable borrow at a time</li>
<li>Each value may not borrow immutably and mutably at the same time</li>
<li>Values will be “dropped” when the owning connecting goes out of scope</li>
<li>Taking a value by <code>self</code> <code>Drop</code>s the original value</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Rust (or move semantics to their full extent in C++11), most people will fight the borrow …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>This article covers beta technology and it's up to date for Xcode 12 beta 1</p></blockquote><p>Starting with iOS 14, we can write apps that are fully built using SwiftUI, dropping the need to have <code>AppDelegate</code> and <code>SceneDelegate</code> files entirely. For as long as I remember, I've <a href="https://www.donnywals.com/handling-deeplinks-in-your-app/">handled deeplinks</a> in my <code>AppDelegate</code> and for the past year in the <code>SceneDelegate</code>. So when Apple introduced developers to this new <code>@main</code> annotated <code>App</code> struct style of building apps, I'm sure we all had the same question on our mind. How does the new <code>App</code> struct work with deeplinks and other tasks that are normally performed in the <code>AppDelegate</code>?</p><p>Luckily, Apple engineers made sure that handling deeplinks in our apps is still possible with the new <code>onOpenURL(perform:)</code> view modifier.</p><h2>Handling deeplinks with onOpenURL</h2><p>The new <code>onOpenURL(perform:)</code> view modifier is new in iOS 14. It allows developers to register a URL handler on their views so they can respond to URLs by modifying state for their views as needed.</p><p>This is vastly different from how we're used to dealing with URLs in UIKit and the <code>SceneDelegate</code> flow.</p><p>The old way of handling deeplinks requires you to handle each link in the <code>SceneDelegate</code> (or <code>AppDelegate</code>). You would have to manipulate the selected tab in a <code>UITabBarViewController</code>, or present a <code>UIViewController</code> by inspecting the current view controller hierarchy and pushing the needed <code>UIViewController</code> from right inside of the <code>SceneDelegate</code>.</p><p>In SwiftUI, you can use the <code>onOpenURL(perform:)</code> on the root of your scene as follows:</p><pre><code>@main
struct MyApplication: App {
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .onOpenURL { url in
          // handle the URL that must be opened
        }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>I will cover what it means exactly to handle the url in the next section of this article, but usually it will involve mutating some state to load and display the view associated with the URL that must be opened.</p><p>What's really neat is that you can specify multiple <code>onOpenURL</code> handlers throughout your app. This means that you can make multiple, smaller changes to your app state which means that you no longer have one place where all of your deeplink handling and view manipulation takes place.</p><p>Furthermore, <code>onOpenURL</code> is called when your app is in the foreground, background or not running at all. This means that there is now a single entry point for your app to handle URLs. Even if your app is relaunched after being force-closed.</p><p>In the next section, I will show you an example of how you can select a tab in a <code>TabView</code> depending on the URL that your app is requested to open. After that, I will show you how to navigate to a list item in a view that's embedded in a <code>TabView</code> by adding a second <code>onOpenURL</code> view modifier on a child <code>View</code> that contains a <code>List</code>.</p><h2>Activating a tab in a TabView when opening a URL</h2><p>In SwiftUI, views are a function of their state. This means that virtually everything in a SwiftUI application can be represented and manipulated as a data model. This means that we can represent the currently selected tab in a SwiftUI <code>TabView</code> as a property on an <code>App</code> struct.</p><p>The following code shows how:</p><pre><code>struct MyApplication: App {
  @State var activeTab = 0

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      TabView(selection: $activeTab) {
        HomeView()
          .tabItem {
            VStack {
              Image(systemName: "house")
              Text("Home")
            }
          }
          .tag(0)

        SettingsView()
          .tabItem {
            VStack {
              Image(systemName: "gearshape")
              Text("Settings")
            }
          }
          .tag(1)
      }
      .onOpenURL { url in
        // determine which tab should be selected and update activeTab
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>What's important to notice here is the <code>activeTab</code> property. This property is marked as <code>@State</code> and represents the selected tab in the <code>TabView</code>. When creating the <code>TabView</code>, I pass a binding to <code>activeTab</code> to the <code>TabView</code>'s initializer. Setting the <code>TabView</code> up like this means that updating <code>activeTab</code> will cause the <code>TabView</code> to update its selected tab as well.</p><p>Notice that I set a <code>tag</code> on the views that are added to the <code>TabView</code>. This <code>tag</code> is used to identify the <code>TabView</code>'s items. When <code>activeTab</code> matches one of the <code>tag</code>s associated with your views, the <code>TabView</code> will activate the matching tab.</p><p>In this case that means setting <code>activeTab</code> to <code>1</code> would activate the tab that displays <code>SettingsView</code>.</p><p>Let's see how you can implement <code>onOpenURL</code> to figure out and activate the correct tab. To do this, I'm going to introduce an extension on <code>URL</code>, and a new type called <code>TabIdentifier</code>:</p><pre><code>enum TabIdentifier: Hashable {
  case home, settings
}

extension URL {
  var isDeeplink: Bool {
    return scheme == "my-url-scheme" // matches my-url-scheme://&lt;rest-of-the-url&gt;
  }

  var tabIdentifier: TabIdentifier? {
    guard isDeeplink else { return nil }

    switch host {
    case "home": return .home // matches my-url-scheme://home/
    case "settings": return .settings // matches my-url-scheme://settings/
    default: return nil
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>The code above is just a convient way to figure out which tab belongs to a <code>URL</code> without having to duplicate logic all over the app. If you decide to implement a similar object, the <code>isDeeplink</code> computed property should be updated according to the URLs you want to support. If you're implementing Universal Links, you'll want to check whether the <code>URL</code>'s <code>host</code> property matches your hostname. I've set up a very minimal check here for demonstration purposes where I only care about the URL scheme.</p><p>The <code>tabIdentifier</code> property is a computed property that uses the <code>host</code> property to determine which tab should be selected. For a Universal Link you'll probably want to use the <code>pathComponents</code> property and compare using the second entry in that array, depending on your mapping strategy. Again, I set this up to be very basic.</p><p>You can use this basic setup in the <code>App</code> struct as follows:</p><pre><code>struct MyApplication: App {
  @State var activeTab = TabIdentifier.home

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      TabView(selection: $activeTab) {
        HomeView()
          .tabItem {
            VStack {
              Image(systemName: "house")
              Text("Home")
            }
          }
          .tag(TabIdentifier.home) // use enum case as tag

        SettingsView()
          .tabItem {
            VStack {
              Image(systemName: "gearshape")
              Text("Settings")
            }
          }
          .tag(TabIdentifier.settings) // use enum case as tag
      }
      .onOpenURL { url in
        guard let tabIdentifier = url.tabIdentifier else {
          return
        }

        activeTab = tabIdentifier
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>Because I made <code>TabIdentifier</code> <code>Hashable</code>, it can be used as the <code>activeTab</code> identifier. Each tab in the <code>TabView</code> is associated with a <code>TabIdentifier</code> through their tags, and by reading the new <code>tabIdentifier</code> that I added to <code>URL</code> in my extension, I can easily extract the appropriate tab identifier associated with the URL that I need to open.</p><p>As soon as I assign the acquired <code>tabIdentifier</code> to <code>activeTab</code>, the <code>TabView</code> is updated marking the appropriate tab as selected along with displaying the appropriate <code>View</code>.</p><p>Of course this is only half of what you'll want to typically do when opening a deeplink. Let's take a look at activating a <code>NavigationLink</code> in a different view next.</p><h2>Handling a URL by activating the correct NavigationLink in a List</h2><p>You already know how to activate a tab in a <code>TabView</code> when your app needs to handle a URL. Often you'll also need to navigate to a specific detail page in the view that's shown for the selected tab item. The cleanest way I have found to do this, is by adding a second <code>onOpenURL</code> handler that's defined within the detail view that should activate your navigation link.</p><p>When you define multiple <code>onOpenURL</code> handlers, the system will call them all, allowing you to make small, local changes to your view's data model. Like selecting a tab in the <code>App</code> struct, and activating a <code>NavigationLink</code> in a child view. Before I show you how to do this, We'll need another extension on <code>URL</code> to extract the information we need to activate the appropriate <code>NavigationLink</code> in a <code>List</code>:</p><pre><code>enum PageIdentifier: Hashable {
  case todoItem(id: UUID)
}

extension URL {
  var detailPage: PageIdentifier? {
    guard let tabIdentifier = tabIdentifier,
          pathComponents.count &gt; 1,
          let uuid = UUID(uuidString: pathComponents[1]) else {
      return nil
    }

    switch tabIdentifier {
    case .home: return .todoItem(id: uuid) // matches my-url-scheme://home/&lt;item-uuid-here&gt;/
    default: return nil
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>I've added a new enum called <code>PageIdentifier</code>. This enum has a single case with an associated value. This associated value represents the identifier of the object that I want to deeplink to. My app is a to-do app, and each to-do item uses a <code>UUID</code> as its unique identifier. This is also the identifier that's used in the deeplink. The approach above is similar to what I've shown in the previous section and if you decide you like my URL parsing approach, you'll have to make some modifications to adapt it in your app.</p><p>The next step is to implement the <code>HomeView</code>, and select the appropriate item from its list of items:</p><pre><code>struct HomeView: View {
  @StateObject var todoItems = TodoItem.defaultList // this is just a placeholder.  
  @State var activeUUID: UUID?

  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      List(todoItems) { todoItem in
        NavigationLink(destination: TodoDetailView(item: todoItem), tag: todoItem.id, selection: $activeUUID) {
          TaskListItem(task: todoItem)
        }
      }
      .navigationTitle(Text("Home"))
      .onOpenURL { url in
        if case .todoItem(let id) = url.detailPage {
          activeUUID = id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>Notice that my <code>HomeView</code> has a property called <code>activeUUID</code>. This property serves the exact same purpose that <code>activeTab</code> fulfilled in the previous section. It represents the identifier for the item that should be selected.</p><p>When creating my <code>Navigat…</code></p></div></div>

<![CDATA[A Writing Incentive Token]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>After I made an announcement to write an article everyday, I have thought about an idea to issue a token for my readers, they bought one token for some price, and if I failed to produce enough good articles within the year, they could get their money back by returning the token. Further more, they could even get back double the price they paid, to punish my failing.</p>

<h2 id="subscription-insurance">Subscription Insurance</h2>

<p>At first it was just yet another idea flashing around, but when I broke the consecutive writings the day before yesterday, the idea appeared again and I realized it more interesting than what I thought.</p>

<p>The first impression of it is more like a bet on something, readers bet one buck on my future works and if I failed they would get  two bucks back. But the difference from a pure bet is they could get something, e.g. reading my thoughts. I’m not saying I’m a genius or fame that my thoughts are important and whenever you read you earn something, treat me like a normal author and the readers someone who like my stories, they pay upfront to buy out my future publications.</p>

<p>Imagine that you love a novel very very much, a series, e.g. <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, and you are eager to read new chapters, but the author keeps delaying, even years after years. However if you pay upfront, it’s like many people make a subscription contract with the author, and they would be incentivized or pushed harder to finish it, otherwise the author must refund the subscription payments, and even a double punishment.</p>

<p>When treating the idea as a subscription advance payment system, it sounds familiar and much more reasonable and feasible, better than a pure bet. It acts as the insurance both for the reader and writer, reader would be guaranteed with good content or money back, and writer with income assurance for their future works. To make things easier for both parties, they could set up a soft cap, e.g. if and only if more than 1,000 readers paid or $100,000 money received, the contract would become effective, otherwise disqualified and hurt nothing. This much money guarantees the writer to work full time on the story, win-win.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain-and-token">Blockchain and Token</h2>

<p>Cryptos are only useful when they are used in a useful situation, i.e. the situation would go very well without any cryptos inside, and cryptos or blockchains are just something to make things better and easier, not to make up some things. The idea described here is of course a useful and meaningful one. But I don’t believe it needs a new blockchain to make things better, a simple transparent token would fulfill all good additions.</p>

<p>Readers may be afraid that they paid upfront and the writer take all the money without delivering anything, and the punishment won’t work neither. Obviously they should rely on some agent or platform to escrow the payments, then the problem becomes the trustworthy of the agent or platform, what if they stole our money, even if they won’t do bad things intentionally, they are still likely to embezzle the fund to do something else. Then they ask another accountant party to guard the agent’s bank account, all seems good now. Assume the accountant is good enough at the work, they would be expensive. Both the agent and accountant cost lots of money, and still they are not transparent for readers and writers, considering the high possibility of frauds in stocks even if such strict SEC rules and laws.</p>

<p>A writing incentive token would solve all the problems.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Issue the token with a smart contract on some decentralized blockchain.</li>
  <li>Readers pay BTC to buy tokens.</li>
  <li>If not enough tokens sold during a period, contract refunds automatically.</li>
  <li>If enough BTC received, contract goes effective.</li>
  <li>All BTC is locked by the contract for 1 year.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then all money and token are transparent on blockchain for anyone to audit at any time, and almost free, only a few bucks of blockchain transaction fees. They can add more rules, e.g. allowing the writer to withdraw some limited BTC from the contract to cover their daily expense, or allowing the readers to vote for an early refund if they realize the writer produces nothing or worse updates.</p>

<p>So good.</p>

<h2 id="steemits">Steemits</h2>

<p>Many people familiar with blockchain may have heard about the steemit blockchain, it describes itself as, <em>“Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing,  and growing social economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It’s a new kind of attention economy.”</em></p>

<p>Most people’s first impression about steemit is spam, many many spam, wether the article, or the comments, or even the votes. This destiny is written in its mission, users are rewarded for sharing their voice, all determined by the system. The system has some decentralized rules written in the code, to judge whether an article or comment is good, to determine the score of a vote. The result is spammers could easily pass all the rules and produce good spam to trick the system, and consequences are good articles disappear because they can’t get enough <em>attention economy</em>.</p>

<p>Spams are so popular not just because the judgement of the system, mainly the $STEEM reward. The system issues some new money everyday, to reward the users for sharing spams. Though they are new issued money, but every $STEEM in the world will be diluted every single day, so the spams are actually rewarded by all $STEEM holders though they never read that article. How come you reward something you never read? Because the system believes that spam is good and you should reward the author, you can’t find anything like this to use your money to encourage and produce spam automatically, not surprisingly the $STEEM price keeps dropping. Maybe most people actually cares about the $STEEM price instead of spam.</p>

<p>Steemit is a failure and deserves it, because it tries to reinvent something useless. Most blockchain projects try to do something with the technology, just because they guess the technology is cool. At most time the correct way to do things is exploring the reality to find something people actually need, and make it better with some technology. Something then technology, not technology followed by something. iPhone and Tesla are commonly treated as the most breakthrough tech innovations in recent decades, and they still follow this order.</p>

<p>Steemit is a failure, so are all steemits.</p>

Subject: Re: C++?? A C++ Critique
<br>From: Guenter Dotzel
<br>To: Ian Joyner &gt;INTERNET: ian@syacus.acus.oz.au
</p><p>
Ian, 
</p><p>
I'm concerned about the recent popularization of both C and C++. Either one of 
these languages seems to be pervasive when talking about a programming 
language. 
</p><p>
I enjoyed reading your article entitled "C++?? A C++ Critique" dated Nov-1992. 
Your article seems to clarify most aspects and rumors about C++. 
</p><p>
According to Prof. Gutknecht from ETH-Zuerich, who talked about the Tragedy 
of Programming Language Development at the 2nd European Modula-2 
Conference, Leicester/UK, Sep-1992, the main features that made C++ "the 
definite programming languages" are: 
</p><p>
C++ supports several programming paradigms and blends, gives access to all 
[abstraction] levels and encuroage breaks of abstraction, is not dangerous 
powerful, is a tricky and challenging game and has completely lost its identity. 
</p><p>
I think your article could help the not so programming language design sensitive 
average application programmers to get a feeling what C++ is all about. I 
assume that even Modula-2 and Oberon-2 programmers would be interested in 
reading your article to find some arguments against C++. I know that they often 
get asked Why don't you switch to modern, popular, high-level, OO-languages 
such as C++? 
</p><p>
As the editor of our monthly, non-commercial, pure-technical, Modula-2 and 
Oberon-2 related newsletter called The ModulaTor, I'd like to ask you for 
permission to publish your article in an upcoming issue of this newsletter. 
</p><p>

Dear Guenter, 
</p><p>
I would be very pleased for you to publish the second edition of my article. 
Thanks for thinking of it. 
</p><p>
As for C++ being a modern language rather than Modula-2 of Oberon, the 
reverse is the case. I find it depressing to think that we are now stuck with a 
language full of compromises that were made for small machines of 25 years 
ago. The Algol style languages, and Pascal forward were designed to be much 
less technology dependent, and so are still relevant today. 
</p><p>
Anyway I think that those who have suffered C silently in the past are now 
finding a voice to be able to counter the criticism and arrogance of the C world to 
view all other languages as second rate, and old. I hope you find the critique 
useful and interesting. If so, please feel free to distribute it among your peers 
and friends. 
</p><p>
[Ed. note: additional notes received from Ian in Jun-1995 via Ruslan, a friend at 
IUE, Moscow:] 
</p><hr>
<p>
C++ is a language that is coming under ever more intense criticism. Bjarne 
Stroustrup finds this unfair, as he says the language delivers what they set out 
to do. However, C++ is a poor implementation of OO technology, and its 
shortcomings need to be criticised. One critique of C++ is my own C++?? 
Critique. 
</p><p>
Another appraisal of C++ as compared to Eiffel is in Richard Wiener's "Software 
Development using Eiffel: There can be life other than C++" (Prentice Hall), a 
very even handed treatment of the subject. 
</p><p>
Undoubtedly, one person who has set the watermark for OO technology is 
Bertrand Meyer, the creator of Eiffel. He has written several books describing 
object technology which should be read. He pulls no punches in his criticism of 
C++. The recommended <i>Bertrand Meyer</i> reading is 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0136291554/modulaware">
"Object-oriented Software Construction"</a>, 2nd edition, 1995,
and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131928333/modulaware">
"Object Success: A Managers guide to object orientation, 
its impact on the corporation and its use for 
reengineering the software process"</a>.
Both books Prentice Hall. 
</p><p>
I believe that Object-oriented technology has a lot to offer in helping with the 
problems faced by modern and complex software systems. However, to many 
object-oriented people, C++ is the biggest disappointment of all, bringing all the 
bad old ways and a lot of unnecessary complexity to object-orientation. You do 
not need a language so riddled with low level constructs. The correct way is to 
use a pure OO language, and only interface to C, or other low level languages 
through external mechanisms. That way will ensure maintainability, portability, 
and quality. 
</p><p>
I wish you success in your quest for building quality software cost effectively, 
and I think you will find part of the answer to the goal in Object-orientation, but 
not in C++. Critics of C++ are not religious fanatics and cranks as many C++ 
proponents would make out. We realise the shortcomings of C++, and advise 
looking into some of the better ways that are available.

Printing problems? 
</p><p>
If you find the file does not print, you might find that the control D (^D or EOT) as 
the first character in the file is upsetting your printer. Some printers seems to 
require this, and others don't. Just remove it if you have a problem. 
</p><p>
If there are carriage returns that your printer objects to remove all ^M 
characters. 
</p><p>
Some printers are fussy about the page size. I have formatted it for U.S Letter, 
as it is shorter than A4 and so should avoid any truncation problems. However, 
this is a problem for some A4 printers. If this is the case, replace the line: 
</p><p>
/oldDictCount countdictstack def {letter 
</p><p>
by 
</p><p>
/oldDictCount countdictstack def {a4 
</p><p>
The papertray command might have to be changed from 0 to 1. 
</p><p>
Otherwise, make sure that you have 'uncompress'ed the file, and that you are 
sending it to a PostScript printer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0e74a9a2acebd70c05fe"><div><p>For the three years starting in April of 2017, I ran much of <a href="http://theprepared.org/newsletter" target="_blank">The Prepared’s</a> (and ultimately my family’s) income through Patreon. I started doing so as an experiment - one that by any measure has been a success. But while Patreon was instrumental in that process, I recommend that creators <strong>not</strong> structure their incomes and careers around Patreon. Here’s why.</p><p>Like many creators, I chose Patreon’s “pay by the creation” (rather than “pay by the month) mode. This directly incentivizes creators to continue doing the actual work, and keeps them accountable to the commitments they make. </p><p>But what Patreon doesn’t tell you is that fans can optionally set a monthly cap on their spending, and that cap can be arbitrarily low - even <strong>less than your per-creation commitment level.</strong> In other words, a reader of my weekly newsletter could pledge $5 per newsletter, but then set a $2 monthly cap. The worst part about this is that there’s literally nowhere in the Patreon backend that I can see this cap. I spoke to Patreon’s product team about this in late 2018, and they told me that the best thing I could do is to look at my creation-by-creation analytics at the end of the month and see which of my patrons paid for which creations; if a person doesn’t show up at the end of the month, then they must have set a cap.</p><p>This is a totally unscalable solution, and it makes the process of issuing patron rewards excruciatingly hard to manage. Creators need the ability to quickly and easily determine <strong>who</strong> is paying them for <strong>what</strong>; Patreon makes this impractically hard.</p><p>Further:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593267194369_49688"><div><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Patreon provides email alerts for when a new patron makes a pledge, but has <strong>no email or push notifications for when patrons delete pledges.</strong> </p></li><li><p>Patreon has no creator-side notification system for declined charges or charges that are flagged for fraud. Worse yet, their patron-side notification system appears to be totally ineffective; many long time patrons (and personal friends of mine) were genuinely shocked to hear, many months later, that their monthly charges had been declined - leading to their pledges being automatically canceled by Patreon. Even worse, Patreon’s “Declines” page, which shows the total declined amount on a month by month basis, has no way of showing which patrons’ pledges were declined - you instead need to go into the “Relationship Manager” and filter by “Declined” to see whose charges have gone through, and when.</p></li><li><p>If you, as a creator, go through all of the effort to find charges that<em> </em>have been declined or marked as fraud, it can then be really difficult to recoup that revenue. This is mostly a result of the fact that most Patreon creators charge a small amount of money (a couple dollars) per month. In theory you could email or message the patron when their charge doesn’t go through, but in practice it feels a bit weird to be hounding someone over (say) $4. If the pledge was billed on an annual basis, though, it might be a big enough sum to warrant the effort. </p></li><li><p>Patreon uses accounting terms with little regard for their generally accepted meaning. See the screenshot above, which is titled “Earnings Projections” but then actually lists <em>gross revenue.</em> In accounting, <em>earnings</em> is the same as <em>profit - </em>it’s what a company has left <strong>after every expense is paid, </strong>whereas <em>gross revenue</em> is the total amount that a company takes in and doesn’t take into account expenses at all. In other words, Patreon is suggesting that the numbers here are what will be deposited into my bank account - but once Patreon takes their platform fees, it’ll actually be significantly less. This kind of sloppy terminology is all over Patreon’s creator backend, and no matter how you slice it is either the result of gross incompetence or a deliberate desire to deceive creators.</p></li></ul><p>Between credit card processing fees (2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction) and Patreon’s cut (between 5% and a whopping 12%), your earnings will be <em>significantly</em> less than your top line pledged amount. In practice, I saw total fees of between 8-12%. (Note: I signed up for Patreon before they shifted to tiered pricing, and now have a “Founder” Pro plan at a 5% platform fee rate. If you signed up for a Pro or Premium account today, you’d pay Patreon 3% or 7% more than I do, respectively.)</p><p>If Patreon were actively bringing customers to me - if normal people were just out there browsing Patreon for awesome things to support - then that might make sense. <strong>But the reality is that success on Patreon is inextricably tied to having your own platform and community.</strong> All Patreon does is manage recurring payment processing - a commodity service that many companies do for a drastically lower fee structure. Sure, ostensibly you can also be having conversations with patrons, generating some kind of community there, etc - but every step you take to encourage users to interact with you on Patreon, the more you undermine your own platform. In other words, Patreon engages in rent seeking - but they ultimately do it on <strong>your</strong> platform, and don’t bring a built-in audience with which to raise you higher.</p><p>When I transitioned off of Patreon, I moved to a combination of Quickbooks Online ($645/year; note that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free" target="_blank">Intuit is a terrible company</a>) and Squarespace’s ($480/year) recurring products feature. The result is that my processing fees dropped dramatically. At my peak Patreon earnings, I was spending almost $300/month ($3600/year) on Patreon’s platform fees. My current revenue is roughly 3x what it was then, but I’m paying 68% less than I used to be.<strong> My current payments, web hosting, and accounting software outlay is $1,125 a year; if I had remained on Patreon my annual fees would be about $10,000.</strong></p><p>Okay, you’re saying - so Patreon isn’t the perfect all-in-one platform that will allow me to bill, chat with, and build my audience. But maybe it’s a piece of a larger puzzle?</p><p>It’s a great idea, but unfortunately Patreon does a terrible job integrating with the other services that I use to run my business.</p><p>The first thing I’d want from Patreon is an easy way to automatically share my content (which most creators distribute elsewhere - for me, it’s Mailchimp) to Patreon. But while Patreon does have a public API, it’s poorly developed (there is no sandbox/testing area, and the most recent updates to <a href="https://github.com/Patreon/patreon-python" target="_blank">their API libraries</a> are from January of 2019) and only allows browsing/looking up data on Patreon; you cannot post content to your Patreon account via the API. This lack of functionality also exists in Zapier’s implementation of the Patreon API: You can use Patreon as a trigger, but not as an action.</p><p>What this means is that creators are inherently tied to Patreon’s terrible, horrible, clicky clicky GUI. You are completely tied to the limitations that are built into Patreon’s web product, and don’t have the ability to build automations that’ll speed up your content and customer management.</p><p>Patreon also fails to integrate well with accounting software - something that flies in the face of their promise to give creators “the stability you need to build an independent creative&nbsp;career.” Their API (and Zapier’s implementation of it) only provides <em>pledge</em> activity, and is therefore inaccurate (caps, declines, and fraud aren’t factored in - it’s a guesstimate at what you might make in the future) in all of the ways described above.</p><p>I really can’t stress this enough: <strong>If your intention is to build a meaningful income, there are much better options out there than Patreon. </strong>What Patreon <em>does</em> offer is a quick way to see whether people on the internet will pay you a little money for something that you’re already doing for free. </p><p>This is a nontrivial thing, but it’s something that you should really think through before you start a Patreon page. If it’s a success, then it’ll likely make a lot of sense for you to transition <em>off</em> of Patreon at some point in the foreseeable future. That might be fine - especially if you’re really early on and success feels like a longshot - but The Prepared’s transition off of Patreon required a lot of management on my part and resulted in roughly 1/3 of my patrons dropping their pledges. </p><p>To be clear: I’m deeply appreciative of all of the people and companies who supported me through Patreon, and it really is true that those first couple of dollars made a big impact in the path of my career. But Patreon as a platform did remarkably little to support me along that journey, even after I became a moderately successful creator and took quite a bit of time to explain my frustrations to both their customer service &amp; user research teams.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Everything is based on my personal experience working as a back-end developer at GoDee project. GoDee is a start-up project that offers booking seats on a bus online. You could find more information about this project here:</p><p id="e338">GoDee is a public transportation service. Bus transportation by GoDee is more convenient than motorbikes common for Southeast Asia and cheaper than a taxi. The app-based system allows users to find an appropriate route, select the time, book the seat, and pay for the ride online. And one of the problems of GoDee is traffic jams that severely impact the user experience. Users get tired of waiting and get annoyed by trying to guess the bus arrival time. So, to make the commuting more convenient, it needed service to calculate the bus’s approximate arrival time, aka ETA.</p><p id="5226">Developing ETA from scratch would take at least a year. So, to speed up the process, GoDee decided to implement the Google Distance Matrix API tool. Later they developed their own Pifia micro-service.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*vq9Ao08BtAdAMx5OYhbSlA.gif" width="250" height="429" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/34/1*vq9Ao08BtAdAMx5OYhbSlA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="b97d">Over time, the business grew, and the user base increased. We encountered a problem with increasing requests in the Google Distance Matrix API.</p><h2 id="8971">Why is this a problem?</h2><p id="2a4f">Because every request costs money, Google API provides 10.000 free queries per month, after which every 1.000 queries are charged $20. At that time, we had about 150,000 requests per month.</p><p id="7492">My mentor was very dissatisfied with that. And said that system should change caching to store ETA every 30 minutes. At that time, the system sent requests to the Google API every 3 seconds to get fresh data. However, such a caching algorithm wasn’t efficient, since minibuses were stuck in traffic. And so the distance only changed once every ten minutes. There was another nuance. For example, five users are asking for information about the same bus, and this is the same request. The cache solved this type of problem.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Сache Code</figcaption></figure><p id="8a43">The cache worked, but not for long since GoDee grew even further and faced the same problem — the number of queries has increased again.</p><p id="9a57">It was decided to replace the Google API with OSRM. Basically, OSRM is a service for building a route based on ETA (this is a rough but the short description, if you need details, here is the <a href="http://project-osrm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>).</p><blockquote><p id="113f">The Open Source Routing Machine or OSRM is a C++ implementation of a high-performance routing engine for the shortest paths in road networks.</p><p id="15be">Wikipedia.</p></blockquote><p id="97d4">OSRM has one problem: it builds routes and calculates ETA without taking traffic into account. To solve this problem, I started looking for services that can provide information about traffic in the specified part of the city. HERE Traffic was providing the data I needed. After a little study of the documentation, I wrote a small code that gets traffic information every 30 minutes. And to upload traffic information to OSRM, I wrote a small script with the command <code>./osrm-contract data.osrm --segment-speed-file updates.csv</code> (more details <a href="https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p><p id="cbda">Math time: every half of the hour, there is a request to HERE to get traffic information this are two requests per hour, that is, a day is 48 requests (24 * 2 = 48) and a month is about ≈ 1.488 (48*31 = 1.488) a year 17.520. Yes, we have these free requests from HERE for 15 years would be enough.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Code for getting traffic</figcaption></figure><p id="b1d9">Preliminary tests showed that the service works perfectly, but there is a problem, HERE gives traffic information in “gibberish” and the data does not match the OSRM format. In order for the information to fit, you need to use another service HERE for geocoding + OSRM (for getting points on the map). This is approximately 450.000 requests per month. Later, OSRM was abandoned because the number of requests exceeded the free limit. We didn’t give up and enabled the HERE Distance Matrix API and temporarily removed the Google Distance Matrix API. The logic HERE is simple: we send coordinates from point A to point B and get the bus arrival time.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2e81">After we installed everything on the test server and started checking, we received the first feedback from the testers. They said that ETA reads the time incorrectly. We started looking for the problem, looked at logs (we used Data dog for logs), logs, and tests showed that everything works perfectly. We decided to ask about the problem in a little more detail, and it turned out that if the car is in traffic for 15 minutes, ETA shows the same time. We decided that this is because of the cache because it stores the original time and does not update it for 30 minutes.</p><p id="1d5a">We started looking for the problem, at the beginning we checked the data on the web version of the HERE Distance Matrix API (which is called we go here), everything worked fine, we received the same ETA. This problem was also checked on the google map service. There was no problem. The services themselves show this ETA. We explained everything to testers and businesses, and they accepted everything.</p><p id="18ce">Our team lead suggested connecting another ETA service and returning the Google API as a backup option and writing code with the logic of switching services (the switch was needed if the requests pass the free number of requests).</p><p id="e9c2">The code works the following way:</p><pre><span id="b4e7">val = getCount() // getting the number of queries used</span><span id="9ff9"><em>if</em> getMax() &lt;= val { // checking for the limit of free requests for the service used</span><span id="e935">newService = switchService(s) // // if the limit is reached, switch the service return</span><span id="cae7"><em>return</em> newService(from, to) // giving the logic of the new service </span></pre><p id="054f">We found the following Mapbox service, connected it, installed it, and it worked. As a result, our ETA had:</p><blockquote><p id="625d">“Here” — 250,000 free requests per month<br>Google — 10,000 free requests per month<br>Mapbox — 100,000 free requests per month</p></blockquote><p id="4def">Always look for alternatives, sometimes it happens that the business doesn't want to pay the money for the service and refuses it. As a developer who has worked hard on the service, you should bring the task to real use. This article describes how we were trying to connect more services for the free use of ETA because the business did not want to pay for the service.</p><p id="4330">P.S. As a developer, I believe that if the tool is good and does its job well, then you can pay for the tool’s services (or find Open source projects :D).</p><figure><div></div></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>While Serverless provides<a href="https://talkingserverless.com/2020/05/12/serverless-a-developer-perspective/"> developers many advantages</a>, they also impose many constraints on developers in terms of architecture, deployment options, etc.. While these constraints<a href="https://talkingserverless.com/2020/06/08/top-considerations-for-serverless-developers/"> require developers</a> to change the way they develop and deploy their applications, there are many ways developers can overcome these limitations or find a workaround to manage them gracefully. As we attend meetups, we hear many questions/concerns from developers about the Serverless limitations. In this post, we will talk about some of the limitations and how developers can overcome these limitations.</p>



<ul><li><b>Stateful Applications:</b> Functions as a Service started off as a platform for stateless applications but the trend is changing slowly. It is possible to maintain the state between invocations using various data stores offered by the cloud providers but it came with enormous operational overhead, complexity, and runaway costs / poor SLAs when not managed properly. Now, many new vendors like<a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl"> Zoho Catalyst</a> or Nimbella are offering FaaS platforms with integrated data stores, giving developers an easy option to build stateful applications</li><li><b>Mitigating DDOS:</b> Pay per invocation model of FaaS brings this question into focus as developers (and other decision-makers) ponder using FaaS in their organizations. The DDOS risk is not any different from DDOS attacks on applications running on containers or virtual machines but the correlation between the number of invocations of the function with costs amplifies the threat. In many cases, FaaS vendors may try to reduce the impact of DDOS but the users also bear the responsibility to mitigate the attacks. They can use services like Cloudflare to fend away DDOS attacks. They can also resort to throttling as a way to fend off DDOS attacks but, when used pre-emptively, it may end up impacting the application. Using an alerting mechanism for DDOS and then taking quick remediation like throttling may also help. Some FaaS providers like AWS allow developers to use API Gateway with a key, thereby, limiting the access to API gateways</li><li><b>Latency Issues:</b> When a Serverless platform is used to deploy a small component of a larger complex application, latency could be an impact as these components talk to the rest of the application through REST API calls. This latency in the inter-component communications along with the fact that that the other components of the application may be deployed using other services offered by the cloud provider from a different location may impact, adding latency. This can be mitigated using a loosely coupled architecture like Microservices architecture where FaaS can be used for one or more Microservices</li><li><b>Scaling Issues:</b> While using certain FaaS services for stateful applications, there could be scaling issues. Stress on the datastore could be timing out the requests sent through various API Gateway endpoints. One way to mitigate this is by using one endpoint for writing to the data store and one for reading the data. Now the load can be distributed better by using a Queuing service while writing to the datastore. For the most part, these constraints can be mitigated by using smarter architecture but it may not always be the possibility</li><li><b>Cold Start Problem:</b> Cold start may appear like a problem in FaaS but it is leveraged by cloud providers to provide the service at such low costs. Some providers impose cold start as a constraint but others keep the containers encapsulating the functions warm to avoid the cold start problem. If your application’s user experience cannot afford cold start, it is better to pick a provider who keeps the containers warm to avoid the cold start problem</li><li><b>Integration Testing:</b> One of the biggest problems faced by developers is Integration Testing. In traditional environments, developers will have all the components available locally and they can do the integration testing before the code is pushed into the DevOps pipeline. With FaaS, it is not possible. One way to overcome this limitation is to do the integration testing remotely with the cloud provider than doing it locally. Since FaaS provides a cost-effective way to deploy the application, using the service for dev and test is the right way to deploy applications. This also removes the usual friction that happens between developer and ops teams where each team blames the other for the application failures due to differences in environment</li><li><b>Vendor Lock-in:</b> Vendor lock-in is definitely a limitation with Serverless computing. Some vendors mitigate this risk by offering their service based on an open-source FaaS offering. However, this mitigation is superficial as most of the lock-in happens with the application dependencies like the database service used, etc.. Instead, our suggestion is to use disposable applications while using FaaS. FaaS reduces the cost of deploying applications but it also reduces the cost of developing applications. This combination of a reduction in development and deployment costs is the secret behind the success of FaaS. Disposable applications are applications that cost less to create a new application than change the application as you move from one type of service to another or move cloud providers. By using disposable applications, users need not worry about the lock-in costs and they can focus on building apps and deploying them quickly. When the time to change comes, they can just throw away the existing application and quickly build a new one</li></ul>



<p>Yes, Serverless computing adds lots of constraints for developers and these constraints help the cloud providers to offer the service at a very low cost. By understanding the limitations, developers can easily mitigate the impact of limitations.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>A Go lesson learned: sometimes I don't want to use goroutines if possible</h2>

	<p><small>July  5, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>We have a heavily NFS based server environment <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">here</a>, with <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">multiple NFS servers</a> and an IMAP server that accesses
all mailboxes over NFS. That IMAP server has had <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/LoadAverageIMAPImpactQuestion">ongoing issues
with elevated load averages</a>,
and what at least seems to be IMAP slowness. However, our current
metrics leave a lot of uncertainties about the effects of all of
this, because we basically only have a little bit of performance
data for a few IMAP operations. One thing I'd like to do is gather
some very basic Unix level NFS performance data from our IMAP server
and from some other machines, to see if I can see anything.</p>

<p>One very simple metric is how long it takes to read a little file
from every NFS filesystem we have mounted on a machine. As it
happens, we already have the little files (they're used for another
system management purpose), so all I need is a program to open and
read each one while timing how long it takes. There's an obvious
issue with doing this sequentially, which is that if there's a
single slow filesystem, it could delay everything else.</p>

<p>The obvious answer here was Go, goroutines, and some form of goroutine
pool. Because the goroutines just do IO (and they're only being
used to avoid one bit of IO delaying another separate bit), the
natural size of the goroutine pool is fairly large, say 50 to 100
goroutines (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ManyNFSFilesystemsWhy">we have a lot of NFS filesystems</a>).  This is quite easy and obvious
to implement in Go, so I put together a little Go program for it
and watched the numbers it generated as they jumped around.</p>

<p>Then, out of reflexive caution, I tried running the same program
with a goroutine pool size of 1, which more or less forced serial
execution (the pool goroutine infrastructure was still active but
there was only one worker goroutine doing all the reading). To my
surprise the 'time to read a file' number for all filesystems was
visibly and decidedly lower. I could run the program side by side
with the two different goroutine pool sizes and see this clearly.</p>

<p>Some thinking gave me a possible reason why this is so. My core
code does essentially the following (minus error checking):</p>

<blockquote><pre>start := time.Now()
file, err := os.Open(target)
n, err := file.Read(buffer)
duration := time.Now().Sub(start)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This sequence makes two system calls and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoSchedulerAndSyscalls">each system call is a
potential goroutine preemption point</a>. If
a goroutine gets preempted during either system call, it can only
record the finishing time once it's scheduled again (and finishes
the read, if it was preempted in the open). If there are 50 or more
goroutines all doing this, some of them could well be preempted and
then not scheduled for some time, and that scheduling delay will
show up in the final duration. When there aren't multiple goroutines
active, there should be very little scheduling delay and the recorded
durations (especially the longest durations) will be lower. And the
ideal situation for essentially no goroutine contention is of course
one goroutine.</p>

<p>(Technically this makes two more system calls to get the time at
the start and the end of the sequence, but on modern systems,
especially Linux, these don't take long enough to trigger <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoSchedulerAndSyscalls">Go's
system call preemption</a> and probably don't
even enter the kernel itself.)</p>

<p>Because I still worry about individual slow filesystems slowing
everything down (or stalls on some filesystems), my solution was a
more complicated work pool approach that starts additional worker
goroutines only when all of the current ones seem to have stalled
for too long.  If all goes well (and it generally does in my testing),
this runs with only one goroutine.</p>

<p>(My current code has the drawback that once the goroutine worker
pool expands, all of them stay active, which means that enough
slow filesystems early on in the checks could get me back to the
thundering herd problem. I'm still thinking about that issue.)</p>

            <p>
    The traditional way to get a job interview is to submit your resume and pray. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Everyone does this and it’s taken to be the default because it’s easy. You can send the same resume with the click of a button to totally different companies, no effort on your part other than preparing the resume.
    </p>
    <center>
            <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_fbads/resume_blast.png" width="515" height="354" alt="">
              </center>


    
    <p>
    There’s no way to stand out, no uniqueness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Generally, the way to get around this is to ask for a referral or to reach out to someone at the company for some sort of informational interview. Both of these methods allow for a more personalized approach to job hunting. 
    </p>
    <p>
    But is it possible to go even one step further? 
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    In 2016, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dumbfounder/">Chris Seline</a> was coming off a failed startup and looking for new opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Unlike most other people, though, Chris wasn’t a fan of the resume blast method. 
    </p>
    <p>
    His strategy was to target specific companies and try to get noticed creatively rather than use the traditional channels and get lost in the shuffle. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Chris decided that he really wanted to work for Reddit. 
    </p>
    <p>
    His plan was to write a <a href="https://twicsy-blog.tumblr.com/post/135712326189/hey-reddit-lets-make-some-recommendations">blog post</a> and then email it to the CEO of Reddit. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The blog post is thorough - it’s 2000 words, technical, and you can tell a lot of effort was put into it. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Even if Chris had emailed his post to the Reddit CEO, there’s a strong chance he would have gotten an interview. 99% of applicants don’t put this much effort into an application and receiving such a personalized email is a positive signal. 
    </p>
    <p>
    But Chris didn’t just email him. 
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    He decided to use Facebook Ads to target the CEO of Reddit (Steve Huffman). 
    </p>
    <p>
    Here’s how he did it:
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Find the Reddit CEO’s public Facebook profile
    
    </li><li>Use this to find out where he lived, what he liked, what he was interested in, etc
    
    </li><li>Use the above to run a super targeted FB Ads Campaign
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Note that Chris only wanted <em>one</em> person to click on this Ad, that’s why he had to go super targeted. 
    </p>

    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_fbads/new_fb_ad.png" width="529" height="492" alt="">
          </center>
    
    
    
    
    <p>
    Chris ended up spending $10. The ad reached 197 people. 4 People clicked on it. One of them was the CEO of Reddit.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next thing you know, Reddit HR reached out to schedule an interview. Nicely done. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I contacted Chris to find out if he actually got the job - here’s what he said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    
        I did not. It turns out they were just starting a search for "head of search" at Reddit, and asked if I would like to interview for that job. That would have been my dream job, and definitely worth a move across the country, even with 3 kids and a wife in tow (I live in DC), so naturally I was very excited and said yes. But after a few talks they thought I didn't have enough experience with big companies, so they asked if I would be interested in an IC role. I was, but I wasn't willing to move across the country for that, and they didn't want to hire remote workers. So that was that.
        <span>Chris Seline</span>
    </blockquote>
   
    
    
    
    <p>
    The reason this is a fun story is because of the FB Ads. 
    </p>
    <p>
    But I think what people may gloss over is the amount of time and research Chris put into writing the blog post that he eventually showed to the Reddit CEO. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If we go back to the beginning of this case study, notice how I mentioned that just blasting a resume to a company signals nothing unique and frankly a lack of effort. 
    </p>
    <p>
    A good way to resolve problems is to invert them - if we do that here, we get the following:
    </p>

    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_fbads/blast_v_tailored.png" width="536" height="225" alt="">
          </center>
    
    <p>
    Chris’ blog post was well researched, relevant, and made him stand out. The FB Ads targeting was just the cherry on top.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next time you see a job you really want to get, think about how you can go that one step further. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Thanks to Chris for responding to my email. You can read his original blog post on this <a href="https://twicsy-blog.tumblr.com/post/174063770074/how-i-targeted-the-reddit-ceo-with-facebook-ads-to">here</a>.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is the moment we've all been waiting for. Ten chapters of setup have led us to this moment--to finally be able to load a process from the disk and run it. The file format for executables is called ELF (executable and linkable format). I will go into some detail about it, but there are plenty of avenues you can explore with this one file type.
</p>
<h2>The ELF File Format</h2>
<p>
The executable and linkable format (ELF) is a widely used file format. If you've used Linux, you no doubt have seen it or the effects of it. This file format contains an ELF header, followed by program headers. Each time, we're telling the OS where the linker has mapped the executable sections. If you don't remember, we have a .text section for CPU instructions, .rodata for global constants, .data for global initialized variables, and .bss section for global uninitialized variables. In the ELF format, the compiler decides where to put these. Also, since we're using virtual memory addresses, the ELF header specifies the <em>entry point</em>, which is what we'll put in the program counter when scheduling a process for the first time.

</p>
<p>
Let's look at some Rust structures that will help us. These are in elf.rs.
</p>
<pre><code>
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Header {
    pub magic: u32,
    pub bitsize: u8,
    pub endian: u8,
    pub ident_abi_version: u8,
    pub target_platform: u8,
    pub abi_version: u8,
    pub padding: [u8; 7],
    pub obj_type: u16,
    pub machine: u16, // 0xf3 for RISC-V
    pub version: u32,
    pub entry_addr: usize,
    pub phoff: usize,
    pub shoff: usize,
    pub flags: u32,
    pub ehsize: u16,
    pub phentsize: u16,
    pub phnum: u16,
    pub shentsize: u16,
    pub shnum: u16,
    pub shstrndx: u16,
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
All ELF files start with this ELF Header structure. The very top is 0x7f followed by capital ELF, which is 0x7f 0x45 0x4c and 0x46 as you can see below. I took a simple hexdump of the ls (list) command. You can see sure as sh*t that the magic is right there.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/imgs/ls_elf.png"><img src="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/imgs/ls_elf.png"></a>
</p>
<p>
The rest of the fields will tell us for which architecture this ELF file was made. RISC-V has reserved 0xf3 as its machine type. So, when we load an ELF from the disk, we must make sure it's for the correct architecture. You'll also notice that <code>entry_addr</code> is up there too. This is a virtual memory address where <code>_start</code> begins. Our _start just simply calls main and then when main returns, it calls the exit system call. This is how most programs actually work, but they do a much more rigorous job including getting command line arguments and so forth. Right now, we don't have those.
</p>
<p>
The field that we need to know is the <code>phoff</code> field which specifies the program headers' offset. The program headers is a table of one or more program sections. I took a snapshot of ls (again) and the program headers. You can do the same using <code>readelf -l /bin/ls</code>. The code below shows how I read the ELF header in Rust.
</p>
<pre><code>
let elf_hdr;
unsafe {
  elf_hdr = (buffer.get() as *const elf::Header).as_ref().unwrap();
}
if elf_hdr.magic != elf::MAGIC {
  println!("ELF magic didn't match.");
  return;
}
if elf_hdr.machine != elf::MACHINE_RISCV {
  println!("ELF loaded is not RISC-V.");
  return;
}
if elf_hdr.obj_type != elf::TYPE_EXEC {
  println!("ELF is not an executable.");
  return;
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
You can see that now we're at the program headers, which I took a snapshot of for /bin/ls.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/imgs/ls_program_headers.png"><img src="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/imgs/ls_program_headers.png"></a>
</p>
<p>
The program headers have the following structure in Rust.
</p>
<pre><code>
#[repr(C)]
pub struct ProgramHeader {
    pub seg_type: u32,
    pub flags: u32,
    pub off: usize,
    pub vaddr: usize,
    pub paddr: usize,
    pub filesz: usize,
    pub memsz: usize,
    pub align: usize,
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
/bin/ls uses shared libraries, but we're not that good, yet. So, the only program headers we care about are the ones shown by LOAD. These are the sections that we need to load into memory for our static binaries. In the ProgramHeader structure, we need seg_type to be LOAD. The flags tell us how to protect the virtual memory. There are three flags EXECUTE (1), WRITE (2), and READ (4). We also need the off (offset), which tells us where in the ELF file that section to load into the program memory is contained. Finally, the vaddr is what we need to point the MMU to where we loaded this section into memory. You can see how I did this in test.rs in the test_elf() function.
</p>
<pre><code>
for i in 0..elf_hdr.phnum as usize {
  let ph = ph_tab.add(i).as_ref().unwrap();
  if ph.seg_type != elf::PH_SEG_TYPE_LOAD {
    continue;
  }
  if ph.memsz == 0 {
    continue;
  }
  memcpy(program_mem.add(ph.off), buffer.get().add(ph.off), ph.memsz);
  let mut bits = EntryBits::User.val();
  if ph.flags &amp; elf::PROG_EXECUTE != 0 {
    bits |= EntryBits::Execute.val();
  }
  if ph.flags &amp; elf::PROG_READ != 0 {
    bits |= EntryBits::Read.val();
  }
  if ph.flags &amp; elf::PROG_WRITE != 0 {
    bits |= EntryBits::Write.val();
  }
  let pages = (ph.memsz + PAGE_SIZE) / PAGE_SIZE;
  for i in 0..pages {
    let vaddr = ph.vaddr + i * PAGE_SIZE;
    let paddr = program_mem as usize + ph.off + i * PAGE_SIZE;
    map(table, vaddr, paddr, bits, 0);
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
All I do with the code above is enumerate all of the program headers. The ELF header tells us how many there are via the phnum field. We then check the segment type to see if it is LOAD. If it isn't, we skip it. Then, we check to see if that segment actually contains anything. If not, there's no use in loading it. Then, we copy what we read from the filesystem (buffer) into the process' memory (program_mem). Since these are virtual memory address, the rest of the code determines how we should map the pages.
</p>
<h2>Executing the Process</h2>
<p>
We need to map a few things, including the stack and the program. Also, don't forget to set the program counter to the entry_addr!
</p>
<pre><code>
(*my_proc.frame).pc = elf_hdr.entry_addr;
(*my_proc.frame).regs[2] = STACK_ADDR as usize + STACK_PAGES * PAGE_SIZE;
(*my_proc.frame).mode = CpuMode::User as usize;
(*my_proc.frame).pid = my_proc.pid as usize;
(*my_proc.frame).satp = build_satp(SatpMode::Sv39, my_proc.pid as usize, my_proc.root as usize);
</code>
</pre>
<p>
In here, regs[2] is the stack pointer (SP). This must be valid and mapped, otherwise the process will immediately page fault. Now that everything is set up, our last bit of execution is to add it to the process list. When the scheduler gets around to it, it will run our newly minted process!
</p>
<pre><code>
if let Some(mut pl) = unsafe { PROCESS_LIST.take() } {
  println!(
            "Added user process to the scheduler...get ready \
            for take-off!"
  );
  pl.push_back(my_proc);
  unsafe {
    PROCESS_LIST.replace(pl);
  }
}
else {
  println!("Unable to spawn process.");
}
</code>
</pre>
<h2>Writing Userspace Programs</h2>
<p>
We don't have a C library, yet. However, I'm making the OS come close to the newlib, which is a small C-library mainly for embedded systems. For now, I made a small library called <code>startlib</code> that will get us off the ground, and I copied printf into it.
</p>
<pre><code>
.section .text.init
.global _start
_start:
  call	main
  li	a0, 93
  j 	make_syscall
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The _start is a special label that the compiler will use as the entry point address. Recall that we set this in the program counter when we made a new process. After main returns, we schedule a system call number 93, which is the <code>exit</code> system call. All this system call does is deschedule the process and free all of its resources.
</p>
<p>
There are other utilities, including printf in our small library, but let's make a simple program to see if we can get it to work. To be more robust, I'm going to stretch all of our available sections to see if they load properly.
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;printf.h&gt;

const int SIZE = 1000;
int myarray[SIZE];
int another_array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int main()
{
  printf("I'm a C++ program, and I'm running in user space. How about a big, Hello World\n");
  printf("My array is at 0x%p\n", myarray);
  printf("I'm going to start crunching some numbers, so gimme a minute.\n");
  for (int i = 0;i &lt; SIZE;i++) {
    myarray[i] = another_array[i % 5];
  }
  for (int i = 0;i &lt; 100000000;i++) {
    myarray[i % SIZE] += 1;
  }
  printf("Ok, I'm done crunching. Wanna see myarray[0]? It's %d\n", myarray[0]);
  return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The program doesn't really do anything useful, but it will see if system calls work as well as context switching. On QEMU, this takes around 5 to 8 seconds to run on my machine at home.
</p>
<p>
We then compile this using our C++ toolchain (if you have one). <code>riscv64-unknown-elf-g++ -Wall -O0 -ffreestanding -nostartfiles -nostdlib -static -march=rv64g -mabi=lp64d -I./startlib -L./startlib -o helloworld.elf helloworld.cpp -lstart</code>
</p>
<p>
If you don't have a toolchain, you can download my program here: <a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/helloworld.elf">helloworld.elf</a>. This requires that you have the systems calls identical to mine since it goes by a system call number.
</p>
<h2>Uploading the Program</h2>
<p>
We can use Linux to upload our elf file.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/imgs/upload_hw.png"><img src="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/imgs/upload_hw.png"></a>
</p>
<p>
Take note of the inode number (26) and the file size (14776). Yours might be different, so make sure you stat it! Modify test.rs and put your inode and file size at the top.
</p>
<pre><code>
let files_inode = 26u32; // Change to yours!
let files_size = 14776; // Change to yours!
let bytes_to_read = 1024 * 50;
let mut buffer = BlockBuffer::new(bytes_to_read);
let bytes_read = syscall_fs_read(
                                  8,
                                  files_inode,
                                  buffer.get_mut(),
                                  bytes_to_read as u32,
                                  0,
);
if bytes_read != files_size {
  println!(
            "Unable to load program at inode {}, which should \
            be {} bytes, got {}",
            files_inode, files_size, bytes_read
  );
  return;
}
</code>

        <p>"Men, at some time, are masters of their fates;"</p>
        <p>The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars --</p>
        <p>but in ourselves, that we are underlings"</p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Introduction to civics in the 21st century</h4>
      <p>You are a young adult. You are upset about things going on in America. Maybe you are angry, scared, confused, depressed -- or maybe you feel a strange joy about everything burning down (I've certainly felt that). Maybe you're just so burned out from the insanity that is American politics that you just feel nothing at all anymore.</p>

      <p>Maybe you have some ideas on how to fix things; maybe if everyone adopted the tenets of Marxist socialism, everything would be solved. Maybe big government is the problem; if everyone with power and wealth just left us alone, we could fend for ourselves in peace. Maybe you're already doing good work at a business, philanthropy, or in the government, but you're troubled at how out-of-touch the rest of America seems. Maybe you've been radicalized into a weird internet philosophy, like neoreaction, or you listen to popular cathartic podcasts like <em>Chapo Trap House</em> (I love those guys).</p>

      <p>Maybe you don't have any ideas. You keep your head down, try to avoid the news and politics, and just focus on your work, your friends, and your health (good response, IMO!). Maybe you're so utterly depressed about everything that you've become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9yQhJ02Zbc">doomer</a>; you just want to see everything crumble, and the only activity you have energy for is laying down and rotting (trust me, been there too).</p>
      <p>I'm here to tell you that Iâ€¦â€¦...have absolutely no idea how to fix anything. Honestly, we're probably boned.</p>
      <p>The events of 2020 -- covid, BLM, whatever the hell is going on in Washington DC -- have just been mind-boggling, depressing, and terrifying beyond comprehension. Even worse, 2020 has arrived after decades of deterioration of American ideas and institutions; on the global stage, we are now a complete joke. Especially in the eyes of China; a rising great power that challenges us in ways we've never had to contend with before.</p>
      <p>I don't know how to fix America. But I do know one thing -- the boomers probably won't pull us out of this one. I have no problem with boomers; they're just old people, and eventually, boomerdom will come for us all. They've spent all their lives fighting the battles of the 20th century, and their efforts have kept us safe* and (relatively***) prosperous, while we watch Twitch streams, struggle to find a rewarding career, try to find love, and argue with each other about how best we should treat everybody.</p>
      <p>And honestly? None of this was our fault. We were just kids, teengaers, and fresh college graduates, as the grownups -- likely through benign negligence -- careened American society into the ground. But every year that passes, and the gerontocracy continues to prove its inability to deal with the 21st century (especially with the rise of digital technology), <br><strong>it increasingly becomes our responsibility to fix it.</strong></p>
      <p>Young people are way smarter, more empathetic, and more capable than the old guard imagine. I have some measure of faith that we'll eventually figure it out. But the boomers have one big advantage over us; they are, for the very large part, masters of practicing <em>civility</em>.</p>
      <p>This webpage is a short series of essays on the concept of <em>civics</em>, specifically targeted to the young adults of America. Briefly put, civics is the art of getting along in a democracy. It's quite possible that democracy itself is over (we discuss this in length in the last piece). But for now, if young people want to make effective change, and to make our slice of the world a better place, we need to practice being good citizens. These essays contain some ideas on how we might start doing that.</p>
      <p>==</p>
      <p>This series contains five main parts. It starts with a meditation on <em>black lives matter</em>. The brutal murder of George Floyd kicked off an incredible display of patriotic energy, setting off a series of dizzying events in June. It was this event that inspired me to begin writing; I wanted to do something, but couldn't clarify exactly what I could positively contribute. By the way; black lives matter. It's okay to say it.</p>
      <p>The second essay is a whirlwind tour of the critical -- and potentially lethal -- multitude of crises we face as a society. Many of these issues are purposefully downplayed in popular media, with the (admirable) intent of protecting people from mass panic. I actually agree with the principle of preventing mass panic, but at some point, we will have to learn about and face these problems head on. (If you're not used to ruminating on the collapse of civilization, this essay has the potential to cause anxiety). The second part addresses what we can do about it; the short answer is, mostly nothing.</p>
      <p>The third essay is actually a bit of a detour (this was originally supposed to be three parts), on recent developments in a niche internet community I've been a part of for years. If you want a window into the digital culture that raised me personally, this essay could be illustrative. It also contains some general considerations on the trials and tribulations of being an influential public figure. (In short, it's bad; if you can at all help it, don't become a public figure).</p>
      <p>The fourth essay ends with a grand discussion of different types of political systems. American-style democracy, for all the good it has done, is still just an experiment. It might not actually be around forever. We consider the alternative of totalitarianism, which is the logical step backwards if democratic-style governance proves itself to be ultimately infeasible. The meat of my argument is here; what it means to be a good citizen, and how we might get there.</p>
      <p>Finally, I say a few words on something very important to me.</p>
      <p>==</p>
      <p>Here are the essays. You can read them in any order; it might actually be best to start with part 4, since it contains the most actually new ideas -- if you're already familiar with how screwed we are, part 2 is mostly just a recap. I would love to hear any feedback, thoughts, or ideas you have when reading this; my contact information is at the bottom.</p>

      <p>General disclaimer on writing: I write in a very dense, long-winded style. I use some internet slang, some cuss words, and lots of ideas and concepts that are defined elsewhere. If you don't know what something means, try Googling it.</p>
      <p>Overall, I recommend going slow; this will probably take at least an hour to read, and many of the things I talk about are just poorly-defined shorthands for much larger discussions that have happened in the past, or in other forums. Feel free to skip over any section that seems confusing or weird. Finally, my advice for dense writing in general; it is best consumed sober.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>I took a picture of a pretty flower on my walk. When I got home, I logged on to
my email via a web browser and sent the picture (<code>original_flower.heic</code>) to a
privacy-focused friend along with a poem that I hoped they would enjoy.
They responded with a puzzle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your photo (<code>original_flower.heic</code>) is attached along with another photo (<code>updated_flower.heic</code>) that’s nearly identical.</p>

<p>Spot the difference! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Visually the photos looked identical. I confirmed their visual similarity via
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing">perceptual hashing</a> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/">tool</a>.
It wasn’t just my eyes! However, the hashes of the files themselves were different so
I suspected photo metadata must be different.
I ran the photos through <a href="https://exiftool.org/"><code>exiftool</code></a> and discovered the original photo I sent
(<code>original_flower.heic</code>) contained <strong>145</strong> different metadata attributes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> including
privacy-sensitive info like the time I took the photo and the exact location I took
the photos (i.e. GPS Coordinates) while the updated version (<code>updated_flower.heic</code>)
had most of these fields removed except for essential fields.</p>

<p>Most phones automatically record and embed sensitive time and location information
in photos and users unkowingly share this info with third-parties while only intending
to share the visual content of the photo. It would be helpful if the built-in photo
apps warn you when you are sharing a photo that this information will be sent and allow you to quickly remove it before
sharing. Additionally, browsers themselves should consider scanning files on upload
for sensitive metadata content and warn the user before completing the upload or provide a quick way for the sensitive info to be stripped right there in the upload dialog. (This would never be exhasutive, but
doing it for photos probably covers a lot of the cases where users accidentally share
more than they intended.)</p>

<p>If you are comfortable with the commandline, you can view photo metadata via:</p>

<pre><code>$ exiftool /path/to/photo.png
</code></pre>

<p>and remove non-essential fields via:</p>

<pre><code>$ exiftool -all= /path/to/photo.png
</code></pre>

<p>However, it would be neat to see OSes and browsers automatically provide this
option before data changes hands from the user to a third-party.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271" target="_blank">BGP</a> is one of many protocols that powers the Internet. Chances are you have heard of it, even if you don’t work in or around the computer networking space. If you aren’t familiar, I’ll try to provide some quick background:</p>
<ul>
<li>BGP is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol" target="_blank">distance-vector routing protocol</a> used to disseminate routing information.</li>
<li>A BGP speaker implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">finite state machine</a> with 6 states:
<ul>
<li>Idle</li>
<li>Active</li>
<li>Connect</li>
<li>OpenSent</li>
<li>OpenConfirm</li>
<li>Established</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inputs to the BGP FSM include messages, timer events, and administrative events.</li>
<li>Routing information is exchanged via UPDATE messages in the Established state.</li>
<li>BGP is extensible; speakers communicate their capabilities via OPEN messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expanding on that last bullet point, it’s difficult to summarize exactly how/where BGP is used due to its flexibility and extensibility. Various <a href="https://ietf.org/about/" target="_blank">IETF</a> Working Groups continue to publish BGP-related RFCs for a protocol that took shape in the early 90s. As the BGP landscape and application widens, we need software that enables us to keep up.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll provide some of my personal experience and history working with BGP, and introduce a new BGP library, <a href="https://github.com/jwhited/corebgp" target="_blank">CoreBGP</a>, which can be used to build the next generation of BGP-enabled applications.</p>

<p>In October of 2010 I attended my first <a href="https://www.nanog.org/" target="_blank">NANOG</a> meeting in Atlanta, GA after accidentally falling into the position of Network Operations Engineer at work. I worked for a modest-sized hosting provider at the time, and was intrigued with BGP. Upon arriving in Atlanta, I vaguely remember some confusion after telling a cab driver that the hotel I needed to be dropped at was on Peachtree St. I later learned that there are 71 streets in Atlanta with a variant of “Peachtree” in their name, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_Street#Nomenclature" target="_blank">Wikpedia</a>.</p>
<p>I got where I needed to go, eventually, and the first talk I attended was <a href="https://archive.nanog.org/meetings/nanog50/presentations/Sunday/NANOG50.Talk33.NANOG50-BGP-Techniques.pdf" target="_blank">BGP techniques for Internet Service Providers</a> by <a href="http://www.bgp4all.com.au/" target="_blank">Philip Smith</a>. Philip started with the basics before getting into the techniques used at ISPs. So many light bulbs went off for me during this talk. I have yet to see any other BGP presentation cover such a breadth of information but still do it in a way that is beginner-friendly, useful as a refresher for any expert, and just downright interesting.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 10 years and I’ve gained a fair share of experience operating networks that use BGP. In more recent years I’ve shifted to software engineering where I’ve had the opportunity to implement various BGP-enabled applications for network observability, data analytics, and SDN purposes.</p>
<p>Each time I started a new BGP-enabled app, I had to answer the following question – which existing BGP implementation should be its foundation?</p>

<p>Of the handful of open source BGP implementations out there, I’ve had hands-on experience with projects making use of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bird.network.cz/" target="_blank">BIRD</a></li>
<li><a href="https://osrg.github.io/gobgp/" target="_blank">GoBGP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.opendaylight.org/what-we-do/odl-platform-overview" target="_blank">OpenDaylight</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.quagga.net/" target="_blank">Quagga</a></li>
</ul>
<p>BIRD shines where a <a href="https://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&amp;v=20&amp;f=bird-5.html" target="_blank">rich policy language</a> is needed. GoBGP has a <a href="https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/tree/master/api" target="_blank">feature-rich gRPC API</a>, and can be embedded as a library. OpenDaylight’s BGP implementation is part of a larger SDN controller solution and has extensive support for <a href="https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-oxygen/user-guide/bgpcep-guide/bgp/bgp-user-guide-linkstate-family.html" target="_blank">BGP-LS</a>. Quagga can reliably produce <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6396" target="_blank">MRT</a> dumps and has been around a long time, though I believe <a href="https://frrouting.org/" target="_blank">FRRouting</a> is now considered its successor.</p>
<p>These are all mature, established implementations. Some of them are in production at large ISPs, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/scaling-droplet-public-networking/" target="_blank">Cloud Providers</a>, and <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/document/bird-manages-routing-worlds-largest-internet-exchanges-bird" target="_blank">Internet Exchange Points</a>. They are purpose-built and make various tradeoffs to suit their use cases (programming language, threading model, data structures, API, etc…).</p>
<p>But what if we are building something that doesn’t line up with the primary use cases of these widely used implementations? We may be locked in to decisions that are ultimately burdensome if we choose to build around them. Swapping in our own data structures for routing tables, or adding a new NLRI is non-trivial. Even if an implementation is intended to be embedded as library, it can still back us into a corner with resource consumption. There’s clearly a need to plug in or hook into specific parts of the BGP FSM, without inheriting decisions that went into a full-blown BGP daemon.</p>
<p>At the 27th IEEE International Conference On Network Protocols (ICNP), a group from the Université catholique de Louvain presented a paper on <code>The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract—Routing protocols such as BGP and OSPF are key components of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. These protocols and the operator’s requirements evolve over time, but it often takes many years for network operators to convince their different router vendors and the IETF to extend routing protocols. Some network operators, notably in enterprise and datacenters have adopted Software Defined Networking (SDN) with its centralised control to be more agile. We propose a new approach to implement routing protocols that enables network operators to innovate while still using distributed routing protocols and thus keeping all their benefits compared to centralised routing approaches. We extend a routing protocol with a virtual machine that is capable of executing plugins. These plugins extend the protocol or modify its underlying algorithms through a simple API to meet the specific requirements of operators. We modify the OSPF and BGP implementations provided by FRRouting and demonstrate the applicability of our approach with several use cases.</p>
<p>— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their paper they present a method for plugging into a previously mentioned open-source BGP implementation, FRRouting. Plugins exist at a function level, either prior to invocation (PRE), as a replacement (REPLACE), or just before returning (POST). Much of their BGP plugin focus is around the reception of messages, and decisions made shortly after:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The BGP daemon is also extended similarly. We add insertion points on functions receiving BGP messages from neighbours, on filters and inside the decision process. We also expose specific functions to the plugins that are executed by the uBPF VM.</p>
<p>— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They take a clever approach with plugin sandboxing by leveraging a user space eBPF VM (<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf" target="_blank">uBPF</a>) linked to the FRRouting protocol implementation. Each plugin compiles to eBPF bytecode and runs inside of said VM. Plugins can be loaded and unloaded without impacting the primary protocol implementation. Using an eBPF VM also allowed them to utilise all the pre-existing Linux Kernel tooling.</p>
<p>I found this approach inspiring, but still not quite a match for my use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugins appear to be built around “incoming” events, or messages. What if I want to inject an UPDATE message to a peer irrespective of what FRRouting wants to send?</li>
<li>FRRouting was not built with this plugin model in mind. Changes/Updates to FRRouting will result in a maintenance headache for the VM hook points.</li>
<li>eBPF bytecode is typically compiled from C. Writing C can be time-consuming in comparison to more modern languages.</li>
<li>I need to be an FRRouting expert to do anything non-trivial.</li>
</ul>
<p>This experience and research led me to create CoreBGP, a BGP library that I could re-use across my BGP-enabled applications.</p>

<p>CoreBGP is a BGP library written in Go that implements the BGP FSM with an event-driven, pluggable model. It exposes an API that empowers the user to:</p>
<ul>
<li>send and validate OPEN message capabilities</li>
<li>handle “important” state transitions</li>
<li>handle incoming UPDATE messages</li>
<li>send outgoing UPDATE messages</li>
</ul>
<p>CoreBGP does not decode UPDATE messages (besides header validation), manage a routing table, or send its own UPDATE messages. These responsibilities are all passed down to the user. Therefore, the intended user is someone who wants that responsibility.</p>
<p>The primary building block of CoreBGP is a Plugin, defined by the following interface:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// Plugin is a BGP peer plugin.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Plugin <span>interface</span> {
	<span>// GetCapabilities is fired when a peer's FSM is in the Connect state prior

</span><span></span>	<span>// during the OpenSent state. Returning a non-nil Notification will cause it
</span><span></span>	<span>// to be sent to the peer and the FSM will transition to the Idle state.
</span><span></span>	<span>//
</span><span></span>	<span>// Per RFC5492 a BGP speaker should only send a Notification if a required
</span><span></span>	<span>// capability is missing; unknown or unsupported capabilities should be

</span><span></span>	<span>OnOpenMessage</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig, capabilities []<span>*</span>Capability) <span>*</span>Notification

</span><span></span>	<span>//
</span><span></span>	<span>// The provided writer can be used to send Update messages to the peer for
</span><span></span>	<span>// the lifetime of the FSM's current, established state. It should be

</span><span></span>	<span>OnEstablished</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig, writer UpdateMessageWriter) UpdateMessageHandler

	<span>// OnClose is fired when a peer's FSM transitions out of the Established
</span><span></span>	<span>// state.
</span><span></span>	<span>OnClose</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here’s an example Plugin that logs when a peer enters/leaves an established state and when an UPDATE message is received:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> plugin <span>struct</span>{}

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Weather forecasting is a tricky problem. Traditionally, it has been done
by manually modelling weather dynamics using differential equations, but this
approach is highly dependent on us getting the equations right. To
avoid this problem, we can
use machine learning to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/a-neural-weather-model-for-eight-hour.html" target="_blank">directly predict the weather</a>, which
let’s us make predictions without modelling the dynamics. However, this
approach requires huge amounts of data to reach good performance.
Fortunately, there is a middle ground: What if we instead use machine
learning to model the <em>dynamics</em> of the weather?</p>

<p>Instead of trying to model how the weather will look in the next time step, what if
we instead model how the weather changes between time steps? More concretely: What if we
learn the <em>differential equations</em> that govern the change in weather?
In this blog article we are going to use <a href="https://julialang.org/" target="_blank">Julia</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/SciML" target="_blank">SciML</a> ecosystem
to do just that. We are going to see how neural ordinary differential
equations (neural ODEs) relate to “regular” networks, how to train
them and see how they can extrapolate time series from just a tiny
amount of training data.</p>

<h2 id="neural-odes-for-time-series">Neural ODEs for time series</h2>

<p>To start us off, let’s talk about how <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366" target="_blank">neural ODEs</a> are used for time
series modeling.
Recall that in a standard machine learning setting we
would assume a discrete set of observations \(y_0, y_1, \dots y_k, \)  \( y_i \in
\mathbb{R}^n \) at time points
\(t_0, t_1, \dots t_k, \), \(t_i \in \mathbb{R} \) to be related through some function \( y_i =
f(t_i; \theta) \) where \( \theta \) are learnable parameters.
However, in a neural ODE we consider a continuous setting and
instead assume that the <em>change</em> in \(y\) is governed by an ODE</p>

<p>\[ \frac{\delta y}{\delta t} = f(y; \theta). \]</p>

<p>The goal is hence not to learn the relationship between \(y\) and
\(t\), but the underlying dynamics of change. If the
dynamics are constant, this has very powerful generalisation capabilities.
It is helpful to think of this formulation as “a neural network inside
an ODE” or maybe “an ODE with learnable parameters”. In fact, the “forward pass”
through a neural ODE is exactly solving an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial%5Fvalue%5Fproblem" target="_blank">initial value problem</a>,
where \( y(t_0) \) is the input features and we replace hand-crafted
equations with a neural network. This means that a <em>single</em>
forward pass gives us an entire trajectory in contrast to e.g. <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html" target="_blank">RNN</a>s,
where each forward pass through the model gives a single prediction.</p>

<p>To make this more concrete,
consider a forward pass for \(y(t_0) =
1.0\) where the model has been trained on \(f^{\star}(x) =
\exp(1.5x)\). A forward pass means inputting \(y(t_0)\) and then using
an ODE solver to step forward in time. When the ODE solver
evaluates \(f\), it uses a neural network to predict \( \frac{\delta y}{\delta t} \).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://sebastiancallh.github.io/ox-hugo/neural-ode-explanation.gif" alt="Figure 1: Solving a simple initial value problem using a trained neural ODE. The only difference from a &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; initial value problem is that the ODE is governed by a neural network instead of a hand-crafted set of equations. Since the network has already been trained, it accurately model dynamics."> <figcaption>

Since the network has already been trained, it accurately model dynamics.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>So how do we train a network inside an ODE? As long as we can
take gradients of \(\theta\) with respect to the loss we can train it
using standard gradient based methods. Fortunately,
<code>DiffEqFlux</code> takes care of everything required to do this for us.
There are <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/analysis/sensitivity/#Sensitivity-Algorithms-1" target="_blank">several strategies</a> that can be specified to compute
gradients, and depending on
the problem you might prefer one over the other. However, for this article
the default <code>InterpolatingAdjoint</code> will be perfectly fine.</p>

<h3 id="model-implementation">Model implementation</h3>

<p>Now that we have a good conceptual idea of the model, let’s see it
in practice. We are going to use <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqFlux.jl" target="_blank">DiffEqFlux</a> to do the heavy lifting, which combines the ODE
solvers of <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl" target="_blank">DifferentialEquations.jl</a> with the differentiable
programming capabilities of <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl" target="_blank">Flux.jl</a>. Using <code>DiffEqFlux</code>, we can simply
construct a neural network to model \(f\) and plug that into a <code>NeuralODE</code>
object. The <code>NeuralODE</code> object itself has a few additional important
hyper-parameters though. Firstly, we have to <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/ode%5Fsolve/" target="_blank">specify an ODE solver</a> and a time span to
solve on. We will use the <code>Tsit5</code> solver, which uses an explicit
method. Secondly, the parameters <code>reltol</code> and <code>abstol</code> let us configure the solution
error tolerance to trade off accuracy and training time.
Recall that a forward pass means solving an initial value problem,
hence a lower tolerance gives a more accurate solution, and in turn
better gradient estimates. But of course, this requires
more function evaluations and are consequently slower to compute.</p>

<h2 id="the-delhi-dataset">The Delhi dataset</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data" target="_blank">dataset</a> we are going to use comprises daily
measurements of the climate in Delhi over several years.
The entire dataset is a single time series, where the last part is
set aside for testing. We will combine both the train and test set though,
since we won’t even need half of the training set to fit a good model.
Let’s load up the data and visualize it.</p>


<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>using</span> DataFrames, CSV

delhi <span>=</span> vcat(delhi_train, delhi_test)</code></pre></div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sebastiancallh.github.io/ox-hugo/delhi-data-visualisation.svg" alt="Figure 2: Visualisation of the raw data. There is a clear seasonal trend, but there are some extreme outliers among the pressure measurements, which make it difficult to see any patterns."> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 2: Visualisation of the raw data. There is a clear seasonal trend, but there are some extreme outliers among the pressure measurements, which make it difficult to see any patterns.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Something is off with the air pressure measurements, indicated by the
extreme outliers after 2016. However, prior to 2016 the measurements
show a nice periodic behavior.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://sebastiancallh.github.io/ox-hugo/pressure-prior-2016.svg" alt="Figure 3: Zooming in on the pressure before 2016 reveal the same pleasant seasonal behavior as in the other measurements."> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 3: Zooming in on the pressure before 2016 reveal the same pleasant seasonal behavior as in the other measurements.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>As an aside, if you read the dataset description it claims that the <code>Mean pressure</code>
variable is measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard%5Fatmosphere%5F(unit)" target="_blank">atm</a>. Now, I have never been to Delhi, but I have my doubts since that would
mean that the city of Delhi suffers under a <em>thousand atmospheres
worth of pressure</em>. While such a phenomenon would be pretty cool and without a doubt get
scientists excited, I think it is more likely the units simply got mixed up, and the
actual unit pressure is millibar. Anyway, let’s prepare the data for model training.</p>

<h3 id="data-pre-processing">Data pre-processing</h3>

<p>All the metrics vary a lot from day to day, so to emphasis the overall
trend in the data we will average the observations into months.</p>

<p>In addition to averaging, we will normalize the data. The features are
normalized to have zero mean and unit variance, and the temporal
dimension is shifted to start at \(0\). Finally, we take the first
\(20\) observations as our training data and leave the remaining for testing.</p>

<p>Since we are training our model using gradient descent, we run the
risk of getting stuck into a bad local minima. This is particularly
true when training on a periodic time series, since the model can easily
settle with predicting the time series mean. Mini-batching can be used to mitigate
this, but for this problem we are going to employ a <a href="https://diffeqflux.sciml.ai/dev/examples/local%5Fminima/" target="_blank">different method</a>.
We are going to train on the first couple of observations until
convergence, then introduce a few more observations. Then train until
convergence, introduce some more observations, etc… By doing this, we
let the model adapt to local changes, resulting in a better fit. The
code below implements this training procedure.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In my previous blog post <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Special-Relativity/">“Special Relativity Explained”</a>, I have explained special relativity and its several key consequences based on the Lorentz transformation.</p>



<p>Since I did not give a derivation for Lorentz transformation last time, in this blog post, I would like to present the derivations in detail.</p>

<h3 id="postulates-of-special-relativity">Postulates of Special Relativity</h3>

<p>Lorentz transformation was derived based on the following two postulates only.</p>

<h4 id="first-postulate-principle-of-relativity">First Postulate (Principle of Relativity)</h4>

<p>The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames of reference.</p>

<h4 id="second-postulate-invariance-of-light-speed">Second Postulate (Invariance of Light Speed)</h4>

<p>As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity $c$ that is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. It is also equivalent to say, the speed of light in free space has the same value $c$ in all inertial frames of reference.</p>

<h3 id="derivation">Derivation</h3>

<p>In the spacetime, we have two reference frames, a reference frame $S$ and another reference frame $S’$ moving at a velocity $v$ with respect to it. So the two reference frames in this scenario are inertial reference frame. The coordinate axes in each reference frame are parallel, i.e., the $x$ and $x’$ axes are parallel, the $y$ and $y’$ axes are parallel, and the $z$ and $z’$ axes are parallel, and remain mutually perpendicular. We assume the relative motion is along the coincident $xx’$ axes. At $t = t’ = 0$, the origins of both coordinate systems are the same, $(x,y,z) = (x’,y’,z’) = (0, 0, 0)$.</p>



<p>An event in the time space could be observed and recorded by the observers on the two reference frames using spacetime coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ in the reference frame $S$ and $(t’,x’,y’,z’)$ in the reference frame $S’$, respectively.</p>



<p>We want to set up the mapping between $(t,x,y,z)$ and $(t’,x’,y’,z’)$ for the same event.</p>

<h4 id="lorentz-transformation-is-linear-transformation">Lorentz Transformation is Linear Transformation</h4>

<p>We propose the spacetime transformation from the reference frame $S$ to the reference frame $S’$ to have the following form.</p>



<p>Note that we could eliminate the variables $y$ and $z$ in the functions $f_t$ and $f_x$ because of $y$ and $z$ are constants.</p>



<p>Now that we have proposed the form of transformation, there could be an infinite number of transformations that satisfied the form. What exactly the transformation is?</p>



<p>Suppose we have two events, one event has coordinates $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$, another one has coordinates $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$. Note that because reference frame $S’$ is moving along the $xx’$ axes, $y_1 = y’_1$, $z_1 = z’_1$, $y_2 = y’_2$, $z_2 = z’_2$.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we set $t_1 = t^{\prime}_1 = 0$, $x_1 = x^{\prime}_1 = 0$.</p>





<p>The two events, $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in reference frame $S$, $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ and $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in reference $S’$ have become equivalent to $(0,0,y_1,z_1)$ and $(\Delta t,\Delta x,y_2,z_2)$ observed in reference frame $S$, $(0,0,y’_1,z’_1)$ and $(\Delta t^{\prime},\Delta x^{\prime},y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in reference $S’$.</p>



<p>Based on the principle of relativity assumption, the transformation still holds. We have</p>



<p>and</p>



<p>This means the distances and time elapsed could also be transformed using the exact transformation for coordinates!</p>



<p>Ignoring uninteresting $y$ and $z$, we could equivalently write</p>





<p>We set a column vector $p = [t, x]^{\top}$ and this $p$ is a tensor in physics. It is also equivalent to write</p>



<p>This is also further equivalent to</p>



<p>In the next step, we would like to further show</p>



<p>Similarly suppose we have two events, one event has coordinates $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$, another one has coordinates $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$. In addition, in the reference frame it is observed that $t_2 = k t_1$ and $x_2 = k x_1$. Based on the principal of relativity assumption, $t’_2 = k t’_1$ and $x’_2 = k x’_1$.</p>



<p>Because</p>





<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>Because we have shown that</p>



<p>This is exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map#Definition_and_first_consequences">definition of a linear function</a> for function $f$ ($f_t$ and $f_x$), and note that this linear function $f$ has no bias term. Therefore, $f(p) = Mp$ for some matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$, and Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation.</p>

<h4 id="lorentz-transformation">Lorentz Transformation</h4>

<p>Because Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation, we could assume</p>



<p>Then the problem is very like the machine learning regression problem where we have to find the values for parameter $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. To solve this regression problem, we need some concrete data.</p>



<p>Because the reference frame $S’$ is moving at velocity $v$ with respect to the reference frame $S$. At time $t$ in the reference frame $S$ and $t’$ in the reference frame $S’$, we know $x = vt$ in the reference frame $S$ overlaps with the origin $x’ = 0$ in the reference frame $S’$. Note that $x = vt + 1$ in the reference frame $S$ does not necessary overlaps with $x’ = 1$ in the reference frame $S’$, although this is true in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation">Galilean transformations</a>.</p>



<p>We found the relationships between $C$ and $D$.</p>



<p>In addition, because the reference frame $S$ is moving at velocity $-v$ with respect to the reference frame $S’$. At time $t$ in the reference frame $S$ and $t’$ in the reference frame $S’$, we know $x = 0$ in the reference frame $S$ overlaps with the origin $x’ = -vt$ in the reference frame $S’$.</p>



<p>We cancel the variable $t’$ and get</p>



<p>So</p>



<p>This reduced the number of free parameters from four to two.</p>



<p>There could many different ways to derive the values for $B$ and $D$, but usually the simplest way is to directly do thought experiments using light. Here is one thought experiment, and there could be many others.</p>



<p>Suppose we shot a beam of light in the reference frame $S’$, At time $t$ in the reference frame $S$ and $t’$ in the reference frame $S’$, the event of the head of the light beam has $x = ct$ in the reference frame $S$ and reference $x’ = ct’$ frame $S’$, where $c$ is the light speed constant, based on the invariance of light speed assumption.</p>



<p>We cancel the variable $t’$ and get</p>



<p>We could then get the relationship between $B$ and $D$</p>



<p>Now the linear transformation has become</p>



<p>We are able to derive the inverse transformation as well.</p>



<p>That the reference frame $S’$ is moving at a velocity $v$ with respect to the reference frame $S$ is equivalent to that the reference frame $S$ is moving at a velocity $-v$ with respect to the reference frame $S’$. Based on the principle of relativity assumption, the linear transformation also has the same form, which is</p>



<p>This means that</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>We often use $\gamma$ to represent this factor, and this factor is called Lorentz factor.</p>



<p>The linear transformation is called Lorentz transformation.</p>



<p>We could further include the other two dimensions for $yy’$ and $zz’$.</p>



<p>Sometimes, to make the transformation matrix symmetric, we have the following equivalent form.</p>



<p>where</p>



<p>This concludes the derivation.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The derivation of Lorentz transformation is mathematically simple. It only requires to use the basic linear algebra, or even just high school math. However, since the transformation is against our common sense, and the derivation is only based on the two “simple” postulates, we have to be aware not to introduce additional assumptions during derivation.</p>



<p>In high school physics class or college physics class for non-physics-major students, the lecturers would usually just present the Lorentz transformation and skip the derivation in the lectures for special relativity.</p>

If you're reading this, chances are good that you've heard of Kubernetes. (If
you haven't, how exactly did you end up here?) But what actually is Kubernetes?
Is it <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">"Production-Grade Container Orchestration"</a>?  Is it a <a href="https://platform9.com/blog/kubernetes-as-a-cloud-native-operating-system-on-premises-too/">"Cloud-Native
Operating System"</a>? What do either of those phrases even mean?
</p>
<p>
To be completely honest, I'm not always 100% sure. But I think it's interesting
and informative to take a peek under the hood and see what Kubernetes actually
<em>does</em> under the many layers of abstraction and indirection. So just for fun,
let's see what the absolute bare minimum "Kubernetes cluster" actually looks
like. (It's going to be a lot more minimal than setting up Kubernetes <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way">the hard
way</a>.)
</p>
<p>
I'm going to assume a basic familiarity with Kubernetes, Linux, and containers,
but nothing too advanced. By the way, this is all for learning/exploration
purposes, so don't run any of it in production!
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
Big Picture View
</h2>
<p>
Kubernetes has a lot of components and it's sometimes a bit difficult to keep
track of all of them. Here's what the overall architecture looks like according
to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=53571935">Wikipedia</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://eevans.co/blog/minimum-viable-kubernetes/k8s-arch.png" alt="k8s-arch.png" title="k8s-arch.png">
</p>
<p>
There are at least eight components listed in that diagram; we're going to be
ignoring most of them. I'm going to make the claim that the minimal thing you
could reasonably call Kubernetes consists of three essential components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
kubelet
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
kube-apiserver (which depends on etcd as its database)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A container runtime (Docker in this case)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's take a closer look at what each of these do, according to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/">the docs</a>. First,
<strong>kubelet</strong>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers
are running in a Pod.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That sounds simple enough. What about the <strong>container runtime</strong>?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running
containers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tremendously informative. But if you're familiar with Docker, than you should
have a basic idea of what it does. (The details of the separation of concerns
between the container runtime and kubelet are actually a bit subtle, but I won't
be digging into them here.)
</p>
<p>
And the <strong>API server</strong>?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the
Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control
plane.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Anyone who's ever done anything with Kubernetes has interacted with the API,
either directly or through kubectl. It's the core of what makes Kubernetes
Kubernetes, the brain that turns the mountains of YAML we all know and love (?)
into running infrastructure. It seems obvious that we'll want to get it running
for our minimal setup.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-2">
Prerequisites If You Want to Follow Along
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
A Linux virtual or corporeal machine you're OK messing around with as
root (I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 on a VM).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That's it!
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="headline-3">
The Boring Setup
</h2>
<p>
The machine we're using needs Docker installed. (I'm not going to dig too much
into how Docker and containers work; there are some <a href="https://blog.lizzie.io/linux-containers-in-500-loc.html">amazing rabbit holes</a> already
out there if you're interested.) Let's just install it using <code>apt</code>:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ sudo apt install docker.io
$ sudo systemctl start docker</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Next we'll need to get the Kubernetes binaries. We actually only need kubelet to
bootstrap our "cluster", since we can use kubelet to run the other server
components. We'll also grab kubectl to interact with our cluster once it's up
and running.
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ curl -L https://dl.k8s.io/v1.18.5/kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz &gt; server.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf server.tar.gz
$ cp kubernetes/server/bin/kubelet .
$ cp kubernetes/server/bin/kubectl .
$ ./kubelet --version
Kubernetes v1.18.5</code></pre></div>
</div>
<h2 id="headline-4">
Off To The Races
</h2>
<p>
What happens when we try to run kubelet?
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ ./kubelet
F0609 04:03:29.105194    4583 server.go:254] mkdir /var/lib/kubelet: permission denied</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
kubelet needs to run as root; fair enough, since it's tasked with managing the
entire node. Let's see what the CLI options look like:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ ./kubelet -h
&lt;far too much output to copy here&gt;
$ ./kubelet -h | wc -l
284</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Holy cow, that's a lot of options! Thankfully we'll only need a couple of them
for our setup. Here's an option that looks kind of interesting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>--pod-manifest-path</code> string
</p>
<p>
Path to the directory containing static pod files to run, or the path to a
single static pod file. Files starting with dots will be ignored. (DEPRECATED:
This parameter should be set via the config file specified by the Kubelet's
–config flag. See
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/</a> for
more information.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This option allows us to run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/">static pods</a>, which are pods that aren't managed
through the Kubernetes API. Static pods aren't that common in day-to-day
Kubernetes usage but are very useful for bootstrapping clusters, which is
exactly what we're trying to do here. We're going to ignore the loud deprecation
warning (again, don't run this in prod!) and see if we can run a pod.
</p>
<p>
First we'll make a static pod directory and run kubelet:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ mkdir pods
$ sudo ./kubelet --pod-manifest-path=pods</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Then, in another terminal/tmux window/whatever, we'll make a pod manifest:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; pods/hello.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: hello
    command: ["echo", "hello world!"]
EOF</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
kubelet starts spitting out some warnings; other than that it anti-climatically
appears that nothing really happened. But not so! Let's check Docker:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ sudo docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
8c8a35e26663        busybox                "echo 'hello world!'"   36 seconds ago      Exited (0) 36 seconds ago                       k8s_hello_hello-mink8s_default_ab61ef0307c6e0dee2ab05dc1ff94812_4
68f670c3c85f        k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2   "/pause"                2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                                    k8s_POD_hello-mink8s_default_ab61ef0307c6e0dee2ab05dc1ff94812_0
$ sudo docker logs k8s_hello_hello-mink8s_default_ab61ef0307c6e0dee2ab05dc1ff94812_4
hello world!</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
kubelet read the pod manifest and instructed Docker to start a couple of
containers according to our specification. (If you're wondering about that
"pause" container, it's Kubernetes hackery that's used to reap zombie processes
—see <a href="https://www.ianlewis.org/en/almighty-pause-container">this blog post</a> for the gory details.) kubelet will run our <code>busybox</code>
container with our command and restart it ad infinitum until the static pod is
removed.
</p>
<p>
Let's congratulate ourselves: we've just figured out one of the world's most
convoluted ways of printing out text to the terminal!
</p>
<h2 id="headline-5">
Getting etcd running
</h2>
<p>
Our eventual goal is to run the Kubernetes API, but in order to do that we'll
need <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> running first. A static pod ought to fit the bill. Let's run a minimal
etcd cluster by putting the following in a file in the <code>pods</code> directory
(e.g. <code>pods/etcd.yaml</code>):
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: v1
<span>kind</span>: Pod
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: etcd
  <span>namespace</span>: kube-system
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>containers</span>:
  - <span>name</span>: etcd
    <span>command</span>:
    - etcd
    - --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
    <span>image</span>: k8s.gcr.io/etcd:<span>3.4.3-0</span>
    <span>volumeMounts</span>:
    - <span>mountPath</span>: /var/lib/etcd
      <span>name</span>: etcd-data
  <span>hostNetwork</span>: <span>true</span>
  <span>volumes</span>:
  - <span>hostPath</span>:
      <span>path</span>: /var/lib/etcd
      <span>type</span>: DirectoryOrCreate
    <span>name</span>: etcd-data</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
If you've ever worked with Kubernetes, this kind of YAML file should look
familiar. There are only two slightly unusual things worth noting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
We mounted the host's <code>/var/lib/etcd</code> to the pod so that the etcd data will
survive restarts (if we didn't do this the cluster state would get wiped every
time the pod restarted, which would be a drag even for a minimal Kubernetes
setup).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We set <code>hostNetwork: true</code> which, unsurprisingly, sets up the etcd pod to use
the host network instead of the pod-internal network (this will make it easier
for the API server to find the etcd cluster).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some quick sanity checks show that etcd is indeed listening on localhost and
writing to disk:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ curl localhost:2379/version
{"etcdserver":"3.4.3","etcdcluster":"3.4.0"}
$ sudo tree /var/lib/etcd/
/var/lib/etcd/
└── member
    ├── snap
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── db
    └── wal
        ├── 0.tmp
        └── 0000000000000000-0000000000000000.wal</code></pre></div>
</div>
<h2 id="headline-6">
Running the API server
</h2>
<p>
Getting the Kubernetes API server running is even easier. The only CLI flag we
have to pass is <code>--etcd-servers</code>, which does what you'd expect:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: v1
<span>kind</span>: Pod
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: kube-apiserver
  <span>namespace</span>: kube-system
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>containers</span>:
  - <span>name</span>: kube-apiserver
    <span>command</span>:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --etcd-servers=http://<span>127.0.0.1</span>:<span>2379</span>
    <span>image</span>: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1<span>.18.5</span>
  <span>hostNetwork</span>: <span>true</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Put that YAML file in the <code>pods</code> directory and the API server will start. Some
quick <code>curl</code> ing shows that the Kubernetes API is listening on port 8080 with
completely open access—no authentication necessary!
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ curl localhost:8080/healthz
ok
$ curl localhost:8080/api/v1/pods
{
  "kind": "PodList",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "selfLink": "/api/v1/pods",
    "resourceVersion": "59"
  },
  "items": []
}</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
(Again, don't run this setup in production! I was a bit surprised that the
default setup is so insecure, but I assume it's to make development and testing
easier.)
</p>
<p>
And, as a nice surprise, kubectl works out of the box with no extra
configuration!
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ ./kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"18", GitVersion:"v1.18.5", GitCommit:"e6503f8d8f769ace2f338794c914a96fc335df0f", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-06-26T03:47:41Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

$ ./kubectl get pod

</div>
<p>
Easy, right?
</p>
<h2 id="headline-7">

<p>
But digging a bit deeper, something seems amiss:
</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ ./kubectl get pod -n kube-system

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  <p>Clojure has introduced a very interesting idea called ‘transducers’, which decouple sequence transformations (mapping, filtering etc) from sequence implementations like vectors, lazy lists and channels. Transducers and their benefits are well-covered elsewhere, but I’d like to explore some tradeoffs, and compare an alternative (and extremely hypothetical) design based on a staple of the functional programming world, effect handlers.</p>

<p>There are many useful operations that we can carry out on <em>sequences</em>, like mapping, filtering, interleaving, partitioning and so on. Ideally, we’d like to apply these tools to any sequence of values, including list data structures and strings but also channels and observables. Unfortunately, it’s common to have to <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxClojure">reimplement</a> each function we want for new sequences.</p>

<p>Abstracting over sequences is difficult, and requires a significantly more powerful approach than the usual polymorphism and data abstraction. To see why, imagine a somewhat-general <code>map</code> using <code>empty</code> and <code>conj</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>map</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>loop</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>xs</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>
         </span><span>ys</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>empty</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>empty?</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>ys</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>)</span><span>
             </span><span>(</span><span>conj</span><span> </span><span>ys</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>)))))))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, aside from the fact that this has the wrong ordering for some data structures, and could only work with channels if you have language-level coroutines (which Clojure, thanks to the JVM, doesn’t), this definition of <code>map</code> simply can’t be used to produce lazy sequences. Here’s how we implement the lazy version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>map</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>lazy-seq</span><span>
   </span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>not</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>empty?</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>))</span><span>
     </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span> </span><span>xs</span><span>))))))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that the basic structure of the code has changed, from an iterative (tail recursive) form ideal for eager data structures to the context-preserving recursion needed for laziness. Other constructs, like channels, might require yet different organisation, eg as a state machine.</p>

<p>Clojure resolves this with two insights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <em>process</em> (eg working with lists or channels in some way) can usually be seen as a kind of <code>fold</code>, with an appropriate <em>step function</em> of the form <code>result –&gt; input –&gt; result</code>.</li>
  <li><code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and friends extend processes by <em>wrapping</em> the step function, eg <code>step' = (result, input) –&gt; step(result, f(input))</code> to map <code>f</code> alongside whatever was happening before.</li>
</ol>

<p>Processes can therefore accept step-wrapping functions (transducers) to alter their behaviour. The upshot is that you can create and compose objects representing mapping, filtering etc and use them generically on channels, sequences, vectors and so on.</p>

<p>To solve our <code>map</code> problem, we can write data structure production and lazy-sequence production (or channel production, or …) as a single ‘transducible process’. Functions like <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> become transducers which we can hand to these processes to modify their behaviour. Thus we can write <code>map</code> only once, yet use it with many sequence types.</p>

<h2 id="a-sequence-of-caveats">A sequence of caveats</h2>

<p>The problem that transducers solve is an important one; transducers themselves are elegant in conception and clean to work with as a user. However, if you look into how transducers are put together under the hood – or try to implement one yourself – you might find them less easy on the eyes.</p>

              </span><span>result</span><span>)))))))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The elegance of transducers is somewhat eroded as we try to make them more general, and even then they have significant limitations. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transducers like <code>dedupe</code> and <code>take</code> create stateful step functions, which adds extra constraints needed for correctness.</li>
  <li>Others like <code>take-while</code> need an explicit cancellation mechanism, and you want to be careful not to double-wrap the cancellation. Handling initialisation and completion adds yet more burden to implementations.</li>
  <li>Transducible processes themselves <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers#_creating_transducible_processes">can be hard to implement</a>, mainly because of the above concerns, but it’s also because some things (eg lazy sequences) <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/30a36cbe0ef936e57ddba238b7fa6d58ee1cbdce/src/jvm/clojure/lang/TransformerIterator.java">aren’t naturally built with <code>fold</code></a>.</li>
  <li>There is no support for functions that take or produce multiple sequences (<code>interleave</code>, <code>concat</code>, <code>split-with</code> etc).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-effective-alternative">An effective alternative</h2>

<p>Consider the following notation for <code>mapping</code> and <code>filtering</code>, inspired by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/sequences">F#’s list comprehensions</a>. I’m using a hypothetical C/Koka-like syntax here but all my examples could be converted to simple Clojure equivalents (<code>loop</code>/<code>recur</code> and explicit passing of variables, <code>for</code>, etc).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>mapping</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>filtering</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a notation, this seems abstract enough. There’s no dependence on how we get values (<code>xs</code> could be anything and iteration can use a generic protocol). It avoids expressing how we build an output sequence, or even whether we do, just what values appear in it. F# lets us omit the <code>yield</code> (eg <code>for x in xs –&gt; x^2</code>), which makes things look more like a traditional list comprehension, but for clarity we’ll keep them explicit.</p>

<p>The key idea is to make this code run via <em>effect handlers</em> (implemented in F#, with lexical scope, as ‘computation expressions’<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>), which let us plug in a definition of <code>yield</code>. Effect handlers have their origin in strongly-typed functional programming but they are really quite lisp-y, and can be thought of as resumable exceptions.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>At the simplest, we can just create an empty array and append to it each time a value is <code>yield</code>ed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>handle</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>mapping</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>with</span> <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
  <span>resume</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>return</span> <span>ys</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>yield(x)</code> is a bit like throwing an exception, except that after handling it we can jump back to where we were with <code>resume</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of building a list, we can do a map-reduce without any intermediate collection being constructed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>handle</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>mapping</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>with</span> <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>sum</span> <span>+=</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>resume</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>return</span> <span>sum</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can compile down to the tight loop we want for simple data structures.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> But what’s going to be really mind-bending is how straightforwardly we can turn our loop into a lazy sequence.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>handle</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>mapping</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span> <span>with</span> <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>cons</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>LazySeq</span><span>(</span><span>resume</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s happening here is that <code>yield</code> doesn’t call <code>resume</code>, so the loop gets paused the first time it is called, and the whole block returns a <code>cons</code>. <code>resume</code> will get called when we try to access the tail of <code>ys</code>, restarting the loop. The loop hits the next <code>yield</code>, suspends, and returns a new <code>cons</code> with item two and a new <code>resume</code>, and so on. Eventually the <code>mapping</code> will finish and <code>resume</code> returns <code>nil</code>, completing the list.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p><code>mapping</code> here takes on the role of transducer, expressing what <code>map</code> does abstractly without nailing down the details. Effect handlers then allow us to instantiate <code>mapping</code> as a set of concrete processes, and potentially very different ones depending on the context. In all we can achieve the same core goal in a wonderfully expressive way.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can blend Clojure’s <code>into</code> and F#’s <code>seq</code> into one list comprehension construct which picks the appropriate <code>yield</code> handler for the kind of sequence we are building.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>into</span> <span>empty</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <code>map</code> can behave appropriately, and generate efficient code, whether <code>xs</code> is a vector, persistent list, lazy list, string, channel, observable, promise or whatever, which solves our generic implementation problem. And we can compose pipelines just like we did before with <code>(-&gt;&gt; xs (map f) (filter g))</code>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>As F# has shown, this way of defining sequence transformations is really expressive. If we want to cancel we can just break out of the loop (or the loop/recur equivalent).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Take while</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we need state, a local variable is enough, since the loop has its own scope.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Dedupe</span>
<span>last</span> <span>=</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>!=</span> <span>last</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>last</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Concatenating sequences is easy, because we can happily have multiple loops, and <code>interleave</code> is easy because we can put <code>yield</code> wherever we want. We can even use nested loops, and I’d argue that the intent is clearer in these than even the simplest transducer implementations. They strike close to the essence of the transformation, without any incidental complexity.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Concat</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span> <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>y</span> <span>in</span> <span>ys</span> <span>{</span> <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>// Interleave</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span> <span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
  <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// Cartesian Product</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>y</span> <span>in</span> <span>ys</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>yield</span><span>((</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can even imagine supporting multiple output sequences, so long as there’s some way of identifying them, for example to partition a channel into matching and non-matching events.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Split-with</span>
<span>into</span> <span>empty</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>trues</span><span>,</span> <span>falses</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>xs</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>trues</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>falses</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="asynchronous-evolution">Asynchronous Evolution</h2>

<p>The above examples, taking things from one bunch of sequences and putting them into another bunch, might begin to look familiar. That’s because the Shyamalan-esque twist to this story is that Clojure <em>already had this abstraction all along</em>, via the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> library. The relationship of <code>go</code> blocks to our generalised list comprehensions is that</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instead of iterating <code>for x in xs</code> we have an explicit <code>&lt;!</code> (take) operation, which is itself an effect; it suspends the code and falls back to a handler, which can <code>resume</code> with a value when one is available.</li>
  <li><code>yield</code> is replaced by the <code>&gt;!</code> (put) effect.</li>
  <li>Both <code>&gt;!</code> and <code>&lt;!</code> are linked to identities (channels), which means multiple inputs and outputs are supported.</li>
</ol>

<p>So we can draw a clear path from list comprehensions to async blocks, two features which might not seem all that related at first, by generalising in some ways and specialising in others. This …</p></div></div>

July 5, 2020 | http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-for-javascript-developers-functions-and-control-flow/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-for-javascript-developers-functions-and-control-flow/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is the third part in a series about introducing the Rust language to JavaScript developers. Here are the past chapters:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-for-javascript-developers-tooling-ecosystem-overview/">Tooling Ecosystem Overview</a></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h2><p>Rust’s function syntax is pretty much similar to the one in JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> income <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> tax <span>=</span> <span>calculate_tax</span><span>(</span>income<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> tax<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>calculate_tax</span><span>(</span>income<span>:</span> i32<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> income <span>*</span> <span>90</span> <span>/</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The only difference you might see above is the type annotations for arguments and return values.</p>
<p>The <code>return</code> keyword can be skipped and it’s very common to see code without an explicit return. If you’re returning implicitly, make sure to remove the semicolon from that line. The above function can be refactored as:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
  let income = 100;
  let tax = calculate_tax(income);
  println!("{}", tax);
}

fn calculate_tax(income: i32) -&gt; i32 {
<span>- return income * 90 / 100;</span>
<span>+ income * 90 / 100</span>
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="Arrow-Functions"><a href="#Arrow-Functions" title="Arrow Functions"></a>Arrow Functions</h2><p>Arrow functions are a popular feature in modern JavaScript - they allow us to write functional code in a concise way.</p>
<p>Rust has something similar and they are called “Closures”. The name might be a bit confusing and would require getting used to because in JavaScript, closures can be created using both normal and arrow functions.</p>
<p>Rust’s closure syntax is very similar to JavaScript’s arrow functions:</p>
<p><strong>Without arguments:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p><strong>With arguments:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>(</span>msg<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"good morning!"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>|</span>msg<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>str<span>|</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> msg<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"good morning!"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p><strong>Returning values:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> add <span>=</span> <span>(</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> add <span>=</span> <span><span>|</span>a<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span> b<span>:</span> i32<span>|</span></span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p><strong>Multiline:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> add <span>=</span> <span>(</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> sum <span>=</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> sum<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> add <span>=</span> <span><span>|</span>a<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span> b<span>:</span> i32<span>|</span></span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> sum <span>=</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s a cheatsheet:<br><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-3/image-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Closures don’t need the type annotations most of the time, but I’ve added them here for clarity.</p>
<h2 id="If-Else"><a href="#If-Else" title="If Else"></a>If Else</h2><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> income <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> tax <span>=</span> <span>calculate_tax</span><span>(</span>income<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> tax<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>calculate_tax</span><span>(</span>income<span>:</span> i32<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> income <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> income <span>&gt;=</span> <span>10</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> income <span>&lt;</span> <span>50</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>20</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>50</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Loops"><a href="#Loops" title="Loops"></a>Loops</h2><p>While loops:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> count <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

  <span>while</span> count <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Normal <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for loops</a> don’t exist in Rust, we need to use <code>while</code> or <code>for..in</code> loops. <code>for..in</code> loops are similar to the <code>for..of</code> loops in JavaScript and they loop over an iterator.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> numbers <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

  <span>for</span> n <span>in</span> numbers<span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> n<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that we’re not iterating directly over the array but instead using the <code>iter</code> method of the array.</p>
<p>We can also loop over <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/range-expr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranges</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> n <span>in</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>5</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> n<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Iterators"><a href="#Iterators" title="Iterators"></a>Iterators</h2><p>In JavaScript, we can use array methods like map/filter/reduce/etc instead of <code>for</code> loops to perform calculations or transformations on an array.</p>
<p>For example, here we take an array of numbers, double them and filter out the elements that are less than 10:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> numbers <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> double <span>=</span> <span>(</span>n<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> n <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> less_than_ten <span>=</span> <span>(</span>n<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> n <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> numbers<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>double<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>less_than_ten<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>result<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In Rust, we can’t directly use map/filter/etc over vectors, we need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the vector into an iterator using <code>iter</code>, <code>into_iter</code> or <code>iter_mut</code> methods</li>
<li>Chain <code>adapters</code> such as map/filter/etc on the iterator</li>
<li>Finally convert the iterator back to a vector using <code>consumers</code> such as <code>collect</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>sum</code> etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust code:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> numbers <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> double <span>=</span> <span><span>|</span>n<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>i32<span>|</span></span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span> n <span>*</span> <span>2</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> less_than_10 <span>=</span> <span><span>|</span>n<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>i32<span>|</span></span> <span>-&gt;</span> bool <span>{</span> <span>*</span>n <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> result<span>:</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>i32<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> numbers<span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>double<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>less_than_10<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>collect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> result<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>You should be able to understand most of the code above but you might notice few things off here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The usage of <code>&amp;</code> and <code>*</code> in the closure</li>
<li>The <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> type annotation for the <code>result</code> variable</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> is the reference operator and the <code>*</code> is the dereference operator. The <code>iter</code> method instead of copying the elements in the vector, it passes them as references to the next adapter in the chain. This is why we use <code>&amp;i32</code> in the map’s closure (double). This closure returns <code>i32</code> but <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filter</a> calls its closure (less_than_10) with reference so that’s why we need to use <code>&amp;i32</code> again. To dereference the argument, we use the <code>*</code> operator. We’ll cover this in more detail in future chapters.</p>
<p>Regarding <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>, so far we haven’t added type annotations to variables as Rust can infer the types automatically, but for <code>collect</code>, we need to be explicitly tell Rust that we expect a <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> output.</p>
<p>Aside from map and filter, there are ton of other <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful adapters</a> that we can use in iterators.</p>
