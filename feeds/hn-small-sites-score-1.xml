			<p>Netflix no longer has any Johnny Depp films streaming in their American library. Coincidence or reaction to his legal loss?</p>
	
					
	<p>Though there has been no official statement from <em>Netflix</em>, the streaming giant has apparently removed all <em>Johnny Depp</em> titles from its American library. This news comes on the heels of actor <strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong> being removed from Netflix’s award consideration website&nbsp;and publicity materials following&nbsp;recent allegations&nbsp;of&nbsp;physical, emotional, and mental abuse. As of this writing, several titles with LaBeouf were still on Netflix. Likewise, Depp titles can still be accessed on Netflix outside the United States.</p>
<p>Depp <a href="https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/johnny-depp-loses-to-the-sun-amber-heard-in-gripping-uk-court-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost a high-profile libel case</a> in the UK last month against the Sun who called the fading former A-lister a wifebeater. In his decision, <strong>Judge Nicol</strong> said, “taking all evidence together, I accept [<strong>Amber Heard</strong>] was the victim of sustained and multiple assaults by Depp. I accept her evidence of the nature of the assaults he committed against her. They must have been terrifying.”</p>
<p>This may have been a delayed reaction to the results of that trial, timed to correspond with their actions on LaBeouf, or it may just be part of Netflix’s standard cycling of titles in and out of their library.</p>
<p>The former Captain Jack Sparrow was also featured in a <a href="https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/the-hollywood-reporters-devastating-expose-on-johnny-depp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scathing article</a> by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> earlier this month in which several Hollywood insiders portrayed him as toxic.</p>
<p>According to satista.com, Netflix had 195.15 million paid subscribers worldwide as of the third quarter&nbsp;<b>of 2020</b>. Most Netflix subscribers are based in the United States, with the U.S. accounting for over&nbsp;<b>73 million</b> of Netflix’s total global subscriber base.&nbsp; They’re not likely to be intimidated by threats of boycotts from fans of Johnny Depp. Disney + still has several available to stream, but they’re under a boycott by Depp fans already.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>It has been about a year since the DeisLabs team starting using Rust in a “serious” project. About this time last year, we started work on what became the <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> project. Since then, we have been using Rust extensively across our projects and have learned a ton more about the language’s strengths and weaknesses. As “Rust After the Honeymoon” posts currently seem to be all the rage, we thought we could contribute a little to the discussion with our experiences writing applications for the cloud world.</p>

<p>This post is organized using the classic (if not tired) good, bad, and ugly structure. In the bad and ugly sections, everything is stated as points of feedback and is not meant as a complaint. The whole point of this post is to go beyond the more superficial parts of the language and into things that really make a difference in our day-to-day programming work. Spoiler alert: We still <em>really</em> like Rust, so all of this is intended as helpful data for those working on the language, to give people new to the language a good idea of some of the things they might run into, and to help others evaluate Rust for their own use. We have tried to incorporate ideas of possible solutions, no matter how vague, to the problems we bring up.</p>

<p>At the very end, we also have a bonus feature about Go and Rust. Given the team’s background in many Go projects, we often hear something like this: “Well, what about Go? Do you regret moving to Rust? What do you miss from Go?” Addressing this in the context of our discussion of Rust felt like a smart decision. If you don’t care about that topic or it doesn’t interest you, feel free to skip it.</p>

<p>Now with that out of the way, let’s get going!</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>

<p>First up, let’s talk about traits. We have absolutely loved the trait system in Rust. In particular, we really enjoy the conversion and reference traits (e.g. <code>TryFrom</code>/<code>From</code>, <code>AsRef</code>, <code>FromStr</code>, <code>Deref</code>, etc.). These are great examples of why traits are better than most other interface-style types – because the type itself doesn’t have to implement an interface to be used as another type. <code>FromStr</code> allows any type to implement a way to parse a bare string into a type (really useful for APIs). Another simple example can be found in the many types that implement <code>AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;</code> or <code>Deref&lt;Type = [u8]&gt;</code>. Instead of having some sort of <code>Bytes</code> interface that all the types have to implement to be able to do operations as if it was a slice of bytes, you can just automatically pick up the methods from the underlying type. Yes, I know you could embed types or use inheritance, but the elegance of this is quite nice. This also allows me to write custom types and have easy/cheap conversions or references to them from other external types. It leads to generic parameters that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// A function that can write anything that can be accessed as bytes:
// write_all("hello!")
// write_all(String::from("hello!"))
// write_all(b"hello!")
fn write_all&lt;T: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;&gt;(data: T)

// Or, I can take anything that can be converted to my custom type
fn do_something&lt;T: Into&lt;MyType&gt;&gt;(thing: T)
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, traits allow you to design flexible APIs for users that allow them to latch on to and/or extend the functionality of your code. This leads to my next point – <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-love-letter-to-serde">A Love Letter to Serde</h3>

<p>Allow us to indulge in a brief love letter to Serde, the much-used serialization/deserialization library leveraged across the Rust ecosystem. To us, it is a first-rate product of Rust’s unique combination of features. It leverages macros, traits, and Rust’s emphasis on zero-cost abstractions to create a library that is powerful, easy to use, and performant. Developers can easily add serialization or deserialization with a simple <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]</code> and then customize deserialization behaviors with attributes. Even if you have to implement it manually, there are plenty of docs to read. Once those traits are implemented, any serialization format that has a Serde implementation (like JSON, YAML, etc.) can then serialize or deserialize that data.</p>

<h3 id="error-handling-option-and-iter">Error handling, <code>Option</code>, and <code>Iter</code></h3>

<p>Another thing high on our “impressive Rust features” list is an amazing set of mapping, unwrapping, and iteration tools. The built in <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types combined with their various mapping methods (and <code>if let</code> or <code>let thing = match {...}</code>) makes it easy to handle errors/missing data in an easy to read way. It also nudges you towards clean and readable error handling patterns (like the try <code>?</code> operator), which is helpful for people new to the language. On top of the error handling, we have the <code>Iterator</code> trait and its associated methods. There are a whole suite of chainable filters, maps, splitting, and zipping methods (similar to how LINQ and functional programming languages handle collections) along with the all-powerful <code>collect</code> method. Below is an example from Krustlet that shows unwrapping an optional value and then mapping and filtering from a collection of data:</p>

<pre><code>fn mount_setting_for(key: &amp;str, items_to_mount: &amp;Option&lt;Vec&lt;KeyToPath&gt;&gt;) -&gt; ItemMount {
    match items_to_mount {
        None =&gt; ItemMount::MountAt(key.to_string()),
        Some(items) =&gt; ItemMount::from(
            items
                .iter()
                .find(|kp| kp.key == key)
                .map(|kp| kp.path.to_string()),
        ),
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="enums">Enums</h3>

<p>We’ve found Rust enums really expressive and convenient. Rust enums aren’t just single values: they can carry associated data. What’s more, each variant can have a different data structure (like discriminated unions from other languages), and you can work with these different cases using pattern matching. They’re also full-blown types, so you can implement functions and traits on them.</p>

<p>The value of this is that you can bundle a bunch of possible cases into a single type to pass into (or return from) and function. Working with the cases is safe because you don’t need to have optional fields that only may apply to certain cases, and you can only access a case’s data when the enum matches that case. The case structure also encourages code that processes enums to adopt a clear, regular layout, making for some quite beautiful code:</p>

<pre><code>pub enum ClientError {
    /// The item already exists
    AlreadyExists,
    /// The error returned when the request is invalid. Contains the underlying HTTP status code and
    /// any message returned from the API
    InvalidRequest {
        status_code: reqwest::StatusCode,
        message: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    },
    /// A server error was encountered. Contains an optional message from the server
    ServerError(Option&lt;String&gt;),
}

pub fn handle_error(e: ClientError) {
    match e {
        ClientError::AlreadyExists =&gt; {
            println!("Item already exists")
        }
        ClientError::InvalidRequest { status_code, message } =&gt; {
            println!("Invalid request. HTTP code: {}, message: {}", status_code, message.unwrap_or_default())
        }
        ClientError::ServerError(Some(message)) =&gt; {
            println!("Server error: {}", message)
        },
        ClientError::ServerError(None) =&gt; {
            println!("Server error")
        },
        
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we created a simple error type and then unwrapped it according to the data contained inside of each variant. The Rust compiler makes sure we handle all variants of the enum, preventing programmer error (likely from getting distracted by a meme someone posted in chat).</p>

<h3 id="grab-bag">Grab Bag</h3>

<ul>
<li>Macros are awesome and allow you to do some powerful things (and clean up code)</li>
<li>Cargo still has our hearts. It is hands down one of the top dependency manager and build tools we’ve used</li>
<li>To quote a coworker: “NO DAMN NULL POINTERS” (emphasis theirs). You explicitly have to label code as <code>unsafe</code> to even get them</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<h3 id="docs-and-clarity">Docs and Clarity</h3>

<p>As we have been using various crates across the ecosystem, we’ve found some interesting patterns in the documentation. Docs are sometimes unclear on what is happening in the actual code. They describe the functionality well, but we generally have to go digging through the code to find out whether it is truly a zero cost abstraction or if there are possible side effects to what we are doing. When you first start on projects, generally these kinds of details don’t matter. But as you start doing things that require more advanced usage, you end up digging under the hood to see what exactly is going on. For example, if we are using a library that writes data to disk, make sure to clarify which methods flush data or close things down.</p>

<p>Related to this, but slightly different, is trait documentation. As users, if we are trying to find out how we can customize behavior, we always end up jumping through a million functions, looking at all the trait bounds, before we can figure out what we need to implement (It also seems to always be a trait imported from <em>another</em> crate). An example of this from some recent work on Krustlet. We were using the <a href="https://docs.rs/tonic/0.3.1/tonic/"><code>tonic</code></a> crate and implementing a socket listener for the server. We ended up at one of the functions that allows for a custom handler, but that had 3-4 distinct bounds, 2 of which were traits from external crates. We eventually found an example in the crate repo and it wasn’t too difficult, but there was no clear documentation what needed to be implemented without digging more. This experience is <em>really really frustrating</em> for new Rust developers and we’ve seen this in multiple crates. The suggestion here would be to put a little more polish into describing what precisely needs to be implemented (even if just linking to an example) on functions with multiple trait bounds.</p>

<h3 id="missing-pieces">Missing Pieces</h3>

<p>Something to be aware of coming into the Rust ecosystem is that a lot of crates are still missing features. A recent example of this was finding out that there isn’t much support for <code>multipart</code> content types in HTTP requests except for <code>multipart/form-data</code>. This is not meant to be a complaint against any developer of any crate. We …</p></div></div>

								<p>"This reminds me of “The Bell Jar” by Sylvia Plath, which has a quote Aziz Ansari used in his series “Master of None”:&gt; "I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.""</p>
							
						
							
								<p>"Much of my life hasn't played out how I expected. I had dreams like many people in high school and none of them came true. Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008/9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I'd worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I've now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I'm really asking for.Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn't about looking back. It isn't even about getting what you want. It's about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you. All that to say, I've embraced the idea that whatever lies ahead is where I'm supposed to be and I needn't look at what my neighbors value or what they have because I don't care. This life is mine to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p>"This is a fascinating subject. It looks like many people are commenting about alternative realities and that exploring them is a fool's game (BTW. I concur with that).The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda/counda/shoulda) didn't happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior/decision making.As an example, it's too easy to say to yourself, "I will start doing sport tomorrow". However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don't have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can't do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, "maybe tomorrow". You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won't require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can't change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me."</p>

      <h2>Virtual care took a steep and unexpected turn during the pandemic. As a result, the changes will not go away so easily. And that's a good thing.</h2>
    </div><div>
      <p>A lot has been written about how digital health took an upturn in development and adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s well-known and pointed out multiple times by Eric Topol that medicine is sclerotic, resistant to change. Such a fast transition and adoption was a shock, but there was no other choice. Partly because patient demand skyrocketed and because tech is not sclerotic. It’s flexible and it constantly develops further, sometimes even too far. <a href="https://medicalnotes.co/issue-19/">Every aspect of healthcare was put under a robust cycle of development</a>. If medicine is so resistant to change, we shouldn’t expect it going away from technology any time soon, should we?</p><p>For this issue, let’s assume healthcare is made up of hospital visits, prescriptions and long-term care with follow-ups.</p><p>But the base for this is connectivity. I was a long-time sceptic of 5G networks, which I found to be a little over the top. 4G is fast enough for daily use and doesn’t require a huge number of antennas. This is the case with 5G, which emits much smaller radio waves with a much shorter useful physical range. The problem was the way I thought about 5G. Honestly, we rarely need such high-speed internet for daily use. But 5G allows more. It allows “new applications in the internet of things (IoT) and machine to machine areas”. In digital health, we call IoT the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which is a lateral and vertical (within areas and between them) connection of wearables, medical records, sensors and apps. This would enable <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tmobile/2020/10/14/cold-flu-and-covid-19-season-why-innovative-care-demands-next-gen-connectivity/">“remote patient monitoring and virtual consultations over HD video, as well as video-enabled prescription management and connected ambulances”</a>.</p><blockquote>Here’s a seriously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tmobile/2020/10/14/cold-flu-and-covid-19-season-why-innovative-care-demands-next-gen-connectivity/">great article in Forbes</a>. It goes into more detail than this first paragraph and I encourage you to read it to understand what is and will be happening.</blockquote><h2 id="virtual-hospital-visits">Virtual hospital visits</h2><p>HD video, countrywide connectivity and data from IoMT will allow healthcare workers to provide virtual care. This creates an ecosystem of devices and data that doctors can use to direct patient care and treatment.</p><blockquote>The ecosystem consists of five different elements (defined by their location): on the body, at home, in community, in the clinic and hospital. They combine to give healthcare professionals a compass for providing care and treatment wherever is best for the patient and to support the “hospital at home” model, a concept first developed by the Johns Hopkins Hospital that’s now gaining traction with healthcare providers around the world. - <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tmobile/2020/10/14/cold-flu-and-covid-19-season-why-innovative-care-demands-next-gen-connectivity/">Forbes</a></blockquote><p>No one says this is optimal or the best type of care. Quite the contrary, my opinion is that doctors should physically interact with patients. But maybe that’s not always necessary or possible. I don’t think anyone would be against a simple and regular virtual check-up. Nor do I think is it safe for patients to walk around hospital wards during a global pandemic. Virtual care, at least to some extent, offers a solution.</p><p>If we’re always talking about how doctors need to be patient-centred and build treatment according to the patient, this is one way to do it. IoMT along with <a href="https://medicalnotes.co/issue-21/">automated systems</a> will free doctors to think about patients and their conditions. Not bureaucracy and administrative work, which is, for example, the critique too many times in Slovenia’s healthcare.</p><p>But the rabbit hole of patient-centricity and digital health in the future goes deeper. It also touches on how clinical trials are planned and executed. This shift in mindset and approach is not just to <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2020/10/use-virtual-visits-to-enhance-the-patient-centricity-of-clinical-trials/?rf=1">“think <em>about</em> the patient, but think <em>as</em> the patient”</a>. Patients often travel to hospitals to participate in clinical trials, even for assessments that could be done remotely. Again, it’s not a do-or-die shift to digital clinical trials. But it offers flexibility and improves the chance of trials’ success.</p><p>The data shows that in clinical trials that take longer to conclude, patients tend to lose interest and drop out, which delays trial timelines and increases their cost. Even more, by conducting these remotely, researchers can include more patients from more geographical areas. Not to mention the possibility of researchers acquiring more and more relevant data (for example, blood pressure or heart rate data every day). <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2020/10/use-virtual-visits-to-enhance-the-patient-centricity-of-clinical-trials/?rf=1">More in another great article here</a>.</p><h2 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h2><p>Prescription medicine and medical devices are probably “the most advanced” sector of virtual care because it’s the simplest. If a patient needs to take medicine over a longer period, why not just have patients reach out via email when they need to renew it. Luckily, this is quite settled and works well. This is speaking from experience in Slovenia.</p><p>There’s an interesting UK company I stumbled upon called <a href="https://www.echo.co.uk/">Echo</a> by Lloyds Pharmacy that takes this on a new level. They partnered with the NHS and deliver prescription medicines to patients’ homes when they order it with them. Simple, effective, patient-centred and on-demand.</p><figure><img src="https://medicalnotes.co/content/images/2020/10/echo.png" alt="Screenshot from https://echo.co.uk" srcset="https://medicalnotes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/echo.png 600w, https://medicalnotes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/echo.png 1000w, https://medicalnotes.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/echo.png 1600w, https://medicalnotes.co/content/images/2020/10/echo.png 2002w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="https://echo.co.uk/">Echo</a></figcaption></figure><p>Then again, how about apps? There’s a wide range of medical apps across all platforms that could be beneficial for patients but are for example paid.</p><p>The German government passed the Digital Healthcare Act (DVG) that officially allows doctors to prescribe apps for their patients. They are the only country to do this thus far. As of last week, they can prescribe “<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/emea/two-healthcare-apps-available-prescription-germany-first-time">the Kalmeda app, which aims to help with tinnitus, and Velibra, a therapy programme for anxiety disorders”</a>.</p><p>This makes so much sense, as “only 6% of patients have used paid medical apps in the past, almost 60% would use these digital tools if their physician prescribed them and the costs were covered by the payer”. Furthermore, apps that are low-risk medical devices can now apply for “fast-track” entry to the market. All of this is the initiative of the German government to promote the digitalisation of healthcare.</p><h2 id="long-term-care">Long-term care</h2><p>Long-term care is the biggest healthcare burden today and will be even greater in the future as the population will get older and live longer. The demand for healthcare professionals cannot follow the trend and that’s why a more digital approach has to take place. To scale long-term care, take the burden off doctors and hospitals and make it easier and better for the patients.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ivanbeckley">Ivan Beckley</a>, student doctor and co-founder of <a href="https://suvera.co.uk/">Suvera Health</a>, put it beautifully in <a href="https://ivanbeckley.substack.com/p/virtual-long-term-care">his article</a> when he wrote that patients with chronic diseases need proactive, accessible and personalised care. Patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension, COPD or depression are relying on hundreds of doctors’ appointments during their lifetime. The patient experience would be so much better if managed (what can be) remotely. This is also exactly what Suvera Health is all about - improving the care experience of patients with chronic conditions.</p><blockquote>By building a feedback loop with our condition review we can begin to intelligently advise a positive incremental change to treatment up to date with the latest guidelines. - Ivan Beckley</blockquote><p>Lastly, all of this can be made available with IoMT. Even today, companies such as <a href="https://www.withings.com/si/en/for-professionals">Withings offer platforms for doctors to follow patient data from their sensors in real-time and on demand</a>. This once again makes patient care centred and more comfortable…just better for both parties.</p><p>I’m sure there are more and there are many more to come with better connectivity and a more flexible medicine.</p><h2 id="links-to-keep-an-eye-on">Links to keep an eye on</h2><p><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0291-x">Deep learning for automated sleep staging using instantaneous heart rate</a>. An interesting paper on training a computer to detect sleep stages using only the heart rate of an individual.</p><p><strong>Article:</strong> <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/655/blockchain-the-amazing-solution-for-almost-nothing/86649455475-f933fe63">Blockchain, the amazing solution for almost nothing</a>. It’s not strictly about blockchain in medicine. It’s also not another blockchain worshipping article. However, it gives a balanced view of where blockchain is useful and where it isn’t. It made me think differently about it and will discuss its actual use cases in healthcare in the coming issues.</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> <a href="https://serotracker.com/">SeroTracker: a global SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence dashboard</a>. There are tons of COVID-19 tracking dashboards and apps. This one is a little different. It’s developed by The Lancet and aggregates the results of serological studies about the disease, which is a way of estimating how many people have and had the disease according to their antibodies. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30631-9/fulltext">See their release paper here.</a></p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Talent war and talent shortage are common myths about tech in general, and data science in particular. In a <a href="https://medium.com/the-ai-lab/talent-shortage-in-ai-is-a-myth-reply-to-cedric-villani-c592047a9a1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">previous blog post</a>, I explained why I thought the problem was rather about Human Resources, an inability to design appropriate recruitment processes.</p><p>Now I have more facts to support this claim. I recently decided to apply for data scientist positions, given the new opportunities in remote work opened by the coronavirus pandemic. I got interviews at Toptal, Sleepiz and Sensyne.</p><p>In this blog post, I am going to share some details about what really happens in these job interviews, from my personal perspective as a <a href="https://www.quora.com/I-am-a-copy-and-paste-developer-how-do-I-become-a-real-software-developer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">copy-paste data scientist</a>, who acquired the reflex of asking Google, GitHub and StackOverflow before starting to code by myself.</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XeXvhTpBFXvYlcxF.jpeg"></p><h3 id="toptal-test-with-stackoverflow-solution">Toptal: Test with StackOverflow solution</h3><p>First, I applied to Toptal, a selective freelancing platform claiming to “hire” the top 3% of freelance talent. It means only 3% of applicants succeed at their entry test, opening access to their closed freelancing platform.</p><p>At Toptal, they are now “hiring” data scientists, although they don’t provide any information about current opportunities available on their platform (vs. competitors like Upwork and Freelancer.com, where anyone can see projects from customers):</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pR3iMVDTuBPvUix1.jpeg"></p><p>I applied, and after the HR interview, I was invited to take Codility tests. They consist of complex coding puzzles, with no relevance to data science whatsoever (a Datacamp test would make more sense). Codility is a branch of software engineering by itself, with little real-world applications beyond job interviews. Despite widespread criticism (<a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.qualified.io/blog/posts/why-developers-hate-coding-skills-tests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>…), they are still used in the software industry.</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Sm0brBzR2ExY9dX2.jpeg"></p><p>Some job candidates go through special training to acquire Codility skills. I preferred to ask my best friend: Google! Codility solutions can often be found on Stackoverflow and other coding forums, although the Codility team works hard to modify their tests against copy-paste developers like me.</p><p>I passed one test, and failed at the other two. The Toptal team asked for my feedback, and I naively answered that I unearthed the exact solution of one test from an obscure forum, but for the other two solutions, some tweaking of Stackoverflow posts would be necessary. After all, googling and stackoverflowing are not trivial, they are highly specialized skills, otherwise Stackoverflow wouldn’t be littered with so many duplicate questions. I wanted to present myself as an elite copy-paste programmer, who could find a role on their elitist freelancing platform. They didn’t appreciate my answer:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HA8Q9I0oNjMOlatM.jpeg"></p><p>Their “analysis” and “investigation” consisted of reading my honest feedback email. If copy-paste developers don’t have integrity, who does?</p><p>At the end, I landed on their bottom 97% of tech talent.</p><h3 id="sleepiz-test-with-kaggle-solution">Sleepiz: Test with Kaggle solution</h3><p>Then comes Sleepiz. It’s a spin-off from the prestigious ETH Zurich in Switzerland.</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ou9RnDMEV6n9INZxUiJkOA.jpeg"></p><p>Sleepiz is “<a href="https://sleepiz.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Europe’s most promising digital health startup</a>”, building medical-grade sleep monitoring at home.</p><p>Quite surprisingly, their data science test had nothing to do with their core business in digital health: it was about road safety, the task of predicting police officer attendance in car accidents:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*q7bVvSTTnZ9ZWYFl.jpeg"></p><p>Road safety is very far from my domain expertise either. I expected digital health stuff. So I felt I should learn a bit about road safety before jumping onto the assignment.</p><p>After some intensive googling, I was surprised to find out the exact task on Kaggle! OMG!</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Uvc-xhjMWcISiqkl.jpeg"></p><p>I immediately reported this stunning discovery to the Sleepiz team, insisting that a senior ML engineer/researcher shouldn’t re-invent the wheel. However, it wasn’t enough for Sleepiz:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oi1JcL99PRm06mQu.jpeg"></p><p>Despite a 72 hours deadline to complete the assignment, Sleepiz Lead Data Scientist felt that the comprehensive Kaggle notebook was too “preliminary”. The hiring bar at Sleepiz is extraordinarily high.</p><h3 id="sensyne-health-test-with-wikipedia-solution">Sensyne Health: Test with Wikipedia solution</h3><p>The third company was Sensyne Health, another promising digital health startup, spinning off the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YT61ly-bcUW6zOav.jpeg"></p><p>The HR interview went well, she appreciated my previous experience with medical data.</p><p>The next steps were twofold: a “conversation” (as she called it) with their ML research team, to “tell you more about what Sensyne Health does”, and a data science test. About the test, I clearly asked if I was allowed to use Google, as I told her about my unfortunate experiences with Toptal and Sleepiz. She laughed “We would never do that! Of course!”.</p><p>However, she never sent me the test. I only had a “conversation” with ML team.</p><p>I wanted this conversation to be productive, so I took the initiative to look at the recent publications of interviewers, to find out something inspiring. My attention was caught by their recent paper about Covid-19: “<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20086488v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Early risk assessment for COVID-19 patients from emergency department data using machine learning</a>”. Sensyne Health even brags about this paper on Twitter:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vMjK3NEVCvufcGkF.jpeg"></p><p>I had a similar project within the <a href="https://covind.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">COVIND medical data consortium</a> that I launched at the beginning of the pandemic. So I was baffled that their NHS data, which they also brag a lot about (“<a href="https://www.sensynehealth.com/discovery-nhs-trusts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the world’s largest and most valuable datasets</a>”), didn’t even include patient comorbidities and previous conditions (like diabetes and asthma), which matter a lot in Covid-19, as everyone knows. As a result, their “risk assessment” is unsurprisingly trivial: the “age” feature dwarfs all the others:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*M_EjZAm0b9QQxThB.jpeg"></p><p>It will be hard to demonstrate the value of machine learning for Covid-19 with such paper. According to my quick and superficial understanding (I didn’t want to over-prepare the interview, to keep the tone conversational), I had the inner feeling that it was yet another RIRO model (Rubbish-In, Rubbish-Out), polluting the ML literature. Deeper domain expertise would be needed to salvage the paper, which might explain why they were hiring a new data scientist. But I wanted to listen to authors’ perspective.</p><p>Instead of defending the quality of their data and research, Sensyne Health researchers preferred to quickly transition to Wikipedia-style questions about basic ML algorithms, like how decision trees work, how convnets work, logistic regression, and so on. I only gave high-level answers, as it was just a “conversation”, and I don’t dig into the details of those algorithms every day. Anyway, they already have mature implementations in Sci-kit Learn and Keras. I didn’t expect such questions, but apparently, that’s what Sensyne Health is “very passionate about”…(instead of ML research for healthcare)</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*f6Wddv6ZqHw0XE4_.jpeg"></p><p>If I knew this “conversation” would be about in-depth and detailed explanations of standard and boring machine learning algorithms, I would have browsed Wikipedia in parallel, to refresh my memory.</p><h3 id="when-a-whole-nation-behaves-like-those-startups-the-case-of-algeria">When a whole nation behaves like those startups: the case of Algeria</h3><p>We are in the 21st century, with smartphones everywhere.

<p>Aside from always having a verb at the end, Japanese does not depend on sequence.  Japanese is a grammar defined by <em>grammar particles</em>, functional “words” that glue on to nouns to indicate what purpose the noun serves.</p>



<p>Here we highlight some common Japanese particles in a slice of the ひらがな [hiragana] syllabary.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1069" height="834" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japanese-particles.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can practice your 🎵 listening comprehension👂 of the ひらがな 🎎 <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">here</a>.  But we digress, Japanese relies on <em>grammatical particles</em> to indicate the <strong>who, what, when,  where, and how</strong> of a sentence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who, what, when, where, and how</strong>.</h2>



<h2>で  (de) <strong>where and how</strong></h2>



<p>For example, で [“deh”] implies <em>manner of accomplishment</em> or <em>setting-locality where something takes place.</em> Mapping to English, we cover the <strong>where</strong> [setting] and <strong>how</strong> [means] with で。</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="142" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.34.24-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>に (ni) where and when</h2>



<p>For destinations, or specific times, or precise physical points of existence (being), Japanese relies on the use of the <em>grammatical particle</em> に [“ni” as in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIV4poUZAQo">“we are the knights who say…”</a>].  に [“knee!”] therefore covers <strong>where</strong> [destination] and <strong>when</strong> [moment].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="446" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.36.55-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>が  (ga) who and what</h2>



<p>The <em>grammatical particle</em> が [“ga”] is used to explain <strong>who</strong> and <strong>what</strong> when used as the <strong>grammatical subjects</strong> of a sentence.  </p>



<p>For example: Vegetables are delicious.  Candy is sweet.<br>  (Veggies are <strong>what</strong> is delicious)<br>  (The candy is <strong>what</strong> is sweet)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="366" height="295" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.38.46-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally, in this brief primer, we want to show the concept of <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong> which we have featured on our <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">“Reverse Engineer Some Japanese”</a> page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="737" height="138" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.41.05-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Within a <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong>, we place a noun and cap off the <strong>jar</strong> with a <strong>lid</strong> containing a <em>grammatical particle</em> such as が、に、で or one of the many others.  </p>



<p>In total, there is an estimated 233 + particles (some are multi-mora, that is, multiple letters) and we teach them in a gradual and comprehensible way in <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=83">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a sentence-final verb is placed at the end of a sentence.  In English, this would be akin to moving the “is/are” or “be/exists” verb to the end of every sentence.  Japanese fun is.  Grammar easy is.  Japanese-about thinking = interesting is.</p>



<p>So that’s it. You pick your nouns, you pick the <em>grammatical particles</em> to match based on the meaning of <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong>, and you figure out the sentence-final verb element.  Now you’re thinking in Japanese.</p>



<p>Of course, developing the reflex and intuition around this takes some practice, which is why we devised quizzes for Japanese Complete that help train your intuition on the particles, one-by-one.  You can watch a brief video showing some of the quizzes in action on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">free guide page</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Kanji in English Context</h2>



<p>In order to accelerate Kanji comprehension into English context, as you can see in a sonnet by Shakespeare on <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/learning-to-read">this page</a>.  This pattern follows a similar pattern of adoption that native Japanese took: grab kanji from mainland Asia for their ideographic value and smash them together with your native syllabary to add helpful meaning, nuance, and context.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="177" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.46.27-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Temple NI arrive.</strong> [unstated subjects arrive to the temple]</p>



<p><strong>Enter-before NI, hands OH let’s wash, NE.</strong> [before entering, let’s wash our hands, right?]</p>



<p>We’ve created a substack newsletter to share <em>Kanji in English Context </em>once or twice a month, you can <a href="https://japanesecomplete.substack.com/p/coming-soon">sign up for it here</a> if you’re interested in getting interesting <em>Kanji in English Context</em> lessons to your inbox.</p>



<hr>



<p>One great thing about Japanese grammar is that the <strong>bunsetsu jars</strong> can be arranged in any sequence before the final verb, provided each noun has its appropriately matching <em>grammar particle</em> glued on and intact.  This leads to great fun with parsing, as one can create a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=811">rudimentary Japanese grammar parser</a> from a 5-line EBNF grammar.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1349" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osaka-castle.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully this post made the inner mechanics of Japanese more clear.  Developing intuition and unlocking the language takes study, practice, and determination!  If you’re looking for a program to break the language down logically <strong>and</strong> provide practice and training to help your newfound understanding become intuitive and fast, might we humbly suggest <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>

<p>In my quest to read all the pop neuroscience available online, I read <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/my-testy-encounter-with-the-late-great-gerald-edelman/">this</a> fascinating article on Gerald Edelman. It was full of profound quotes like</p>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have goals. We just have values.</p></blockquote>



<p>More importantly, it talked about the concept of polymorphous sets as proposed by Wittgenstein.</p>



<blockquote><div><p>“Typical Wittgenstein,” Edelman mused. “There is a kind of ostentation in his modesty. I don’t know what that is. He provokes you and it’s very powerful. It’s ambiguous, sometimes, and it’s not cute. It’s riddle, it’s posturing around the riddle.”</p><p>A little girl playing hopscotch, chess players, Swedish sailors doing naval exercises, rugby players are all playing games, Edelman continued. To most observers, these phenomena seem to have little or nothing to do with each other, and yet they are all members of the set of possible games.</p><p>“This defines what is known in the business as a polymorphous set. It’s a very hard thing. It means a set defined by neither necessary nor sufficient conditions.”</p></div></blockquote>



<p>This is something I’ve read about before, and it didn’t strike me that hard before, as it did on reading this article. Most “things” that we talk about in life are polymorphous sets. There is no necessary and sufficient condition for a fruit to be an apple. Does it have to be red? No it can be green. Does it have to be sweet? No it can be sour. Does it have to be of a particular size? No, if you saw a freakishly small apple, you’d still agree that it is an apple. </p>



<h2>Why teaching machines how to identify objects is hard</h2>



<p>A neural network can be taught to recognize a cat if it is fed millions and millions of images of cats, and asked to choose suitable parameters so that it is able to recognize whether a particular object is a cat or not. I, on the other hand, learned to recognize cats by looking at <strong>one</strong> cat. Maybe a couple more. And this is true for almost every other human I know. We haven’t seen all cats in the world. However, if you show me an animal, I can almost always tell you right away if it is a cat or not. Does that mean we might have as much computational power as an actual neural network? <em>Not even close</em>. </p>



<p>The fact that we are able to recognize cats after being shown just a handful of cats follows rom the fact that when we see a cat, we automatically form a polymorphous set of <em>cats</em> in our minds. There is no necessary or sufficient condition to be a cat. A cat doesn’t have to be large or small, black or white, agile or lazy. <em><strong>We will just know whether something is a cat when we see one</strong>. </em></p>



<p>This sounds like a spectacularly bad strategy. What if my polymorphous set of cats differs substantially from yours? It is completely possible. Society would stop functioning if our polymorphous sets of various notions were different enough. However, they’re <em>not</em>. Our brains are similar enough that our polymorphous sets are very very similar for most things, if not the same. You and I may have only seen a handful of tigers in our lives, and probably different individual tigers. However, if we’re walking down a road together and see a tiger, we will instantly recognize it as one. </p>



<p>But hang on. Is the animal that we saw really a tiger? What if it is a slightly mutated version of a tiger (it probably is)? Can we still call that a tiger? For instance, humans are mutations of chimps. If humans (mutated chimps) are not the same as other chimps, why are mutated tigers the same as other tigers? Well….you may say that humans have had millions of mutations by now, but that mutated tiger only probably has a small number of mutations. How many mutations does it take for a tiger to stop being a tiger, and become a different species? Well….we don’t know. All we know is that when we see an animal, we will know when it is a tiger and when it is not. </p>



<p>As one can see above, these polymorphous sets that we have formed in our minds are just horrible by design. They’re not precise, and leave way too much ambiguity. But they work. This is because humans are very similar to one another, and form pretty much the same polymorphous sets. Hence, as long as you and I both agree that that particular animal is a tiger, we are fine. </p>



<p>However, machines obviously have very different “minds” as compared to ours. It is not capable of forming polymorphous sets, leave alone polymorphous sets that are the same as ours. Hence, it has to be fed millions of data points for it to have the same sets as our polymorphous sets. This is not really the machine’s fault. We are terribly imprecise in how we name and define things. The machine wasn’t born as a human, and hence does not possess our particular brains that would help it form the same polymorphous sets. </p>



<p>Is there any hope then? Can we ever have machines that would be able to form the same polymorphous sets as humans? One solution is that if we are able to determine all the parameters inside the human brain and pass them on to a machine, we will never have to teach a machine anything ever again. We will possess perfect communication with it. However, this seems like something that can only be realized in the distant future. Maybe we could also somehow communicate our polymorphous sets’ forming apparatus to machines? Again, I am not aware of any research happening in this direction.</p>



<h2>Mathematics</h2>



<p>Mathematics aims to make things precise. It does so by doing away with the concept of polymorphous sets. </p>



<p>For example, what is a measurable set? It is a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S" title="S"> with the property that for any other set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T" title="T">, we have the property that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%2A%28T%5Ccap+S%29%2Bm%5E%2A%28T%5Ccap+S%5Ec%29%3Dm%5E%2A%28T%29&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m^*(T\cap S)+m^*(T\cap S^c)=m^*(T)" title="m^*(T\cap S)+m^*(T\cap S^c)=m^*(T)">. Of course one would have to define the concept of outer measure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%2A&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m^*" title="m^*"> before describing this. The point of this definition is that it helps us capture an important property of measurable sets, and explicitly tells us whether a set under consideration is measurable or not. Hence, there is a necessary and sufficient criterion for a set to be a member of the class of measurable sets.</p>



<p>Obviously, no one really started with this definition. Here is a possible development of the concept: do you see this nice set? The unit interval? This has some reasonable properties. What’s crazy is that very broken sets like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBbb%7BQ%7D%5Ccap+%5B0%2C1%5D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Bbb{Q}\cap [0,1]" title="\Bbb{Q}\cap [0,1]"> also have these reasonable properties! Alright, so our intuition tells us that very very broken sets can also have all of these properties that we’re talking about. Then someone comes up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-measurable_set">Vitali set</a>. This very broken set clearly does not have the reasonable sounding property you were talking about! </p>



<p>Do we now see that prevents us from forming a polymorphous set of measurable sets? What forces us to come up with precise and bothersome definitions instead? When we form polymorphous sets, we merely attach a nebulous description. We don’t specify any property that the elements of a polymorphous set have to satisfy. For example, the polymorphous set of cats consists of animals that are “feline” in some vaguely defined sense. We don’t say that the polymorphous set of cats has the property that cats are able to jump 1 ft in the air vertically. If we do so, then we are prescribing a necessary condition to the polymorphous set. </p>



<p>In other words, definitions are necessary (and sufficient) conditions. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=111111&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" title="A"> is a measurable set, then it should satisfy these nice properties. If it does not, then it cannot be a member of the class of measurable sets. </p>



<p>As Mathematics is built on definitions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions of membership to a class, it cannot have polymorphous sets. But why not? Why does this concept work in the real world, and not in Mathematics? This is because in the real world we want to just describe something, while in Mathematics we want to derive useful properties of things. For instance, in the real world, when we try to classify animals as cats or not, we don’t want to understand the properties of cats (that they should be able to jump a certain height, or weigh this much, etc). However, in mathematics, when we talk about measurable sets, we want to be able to derive useful properties that they possess (that it can be approximated by an open set, that its measure is countably additive, etc). Prescribing any useful properties leads one to form a necessary and sufficient condition for membership in a set, that does away with polymorphous sets and leads to precise definitions.</p>



<p>Hence, although there is perhaps some value in having polymorphous sets of concepts in Mathematics, when it comes down to deriving interesting properties, the vicious cycle of properties-&gt; necessary and sufficient conditions for membership-&gt; non-intuitive definitions seems inevitable. What is slightly tragic about the way that Mathematics is generally taught at the college level and beyond is that this sequence of events is not made explicit. We’re not told that we want our objects to have these nice properties, and hence we need this long winding definitions. We start with the definition, and are then told that these very nice and non-intuitive definitions miraculously lead to these nice properties. </p>



<p>Perhaps in a future post, I can explain how polymorphous sets can still be useful in developing mathematical intuition. However, it seems irrefutable that precise definitions are absolutely integral to mathematical consistency. </p>

Thanks to the way APT works, if a bug isn’t fixed upstream, Debian can fix it with a patch. If Debian doesn’t, Ubuntu can. If Ubuntu doesn’t Linux Mint can. If Linux Mint doesn’t, anyone can, and not only can they fix it, they can distribute it with a PPA.</p>
<p>Flatpak isn’t as flexible. Still, anyone can distribute their own Flatpaks. If Flathub decides they don’t want to do this or that, anyone else can create another Flatpak repository. Flatpak itself can point to multiple sources and doesn’t depend on Flathub.</p>
<p>Although it is open-source, Snap on the other hand, only works with the Ubuntu Store. Nobody knows how to make a Snap Store and nobody can. The Snap client is designed to work with only one source, following a protocol which isn’t open, and using only one authentication system. Snapd is nothing on its own, it can only work with the Ubuntu Store.</p>
<p>This is a store we can’t audit, which contains software nobody can patch. If we can’t fix or modify software, open-source or not, it provides the same limitations as proprietary software.</p>

<blockquote><p><br>But, if they do not stretch, with the passing of time, their bodies will become clumsier, more painful, incapable, etc. It is of no use to look at oneself in the mirror and not stop asking the reasons why, one needs to exercise or stretch, until one feels “in shape” again . This feeling of being in good shape is so imperceptible that one only becomes aware of it once it has been lost. Therefore, the smart thing to do is to not abandon it.</p><cite> <br><a href="https://amzn.to/37Le8aH">Stretching Exercises Encyclopedia, (2012, 1st edition).</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2>Start Stretching Now!</h2>


<p>You need to start stretching now. Preferably, on a daily basis—if you can. Forgetting about stretching is a common mistake we all commit. Perhaps, we build up the mileage or load up the bar. We feel that we are thriving until injuries, stiffness and fatigue knock our door.</p>
<p>During his career as an ultramarathoner and a navy seal, David Goggins experienced many injuries followed by many surgeries. I’ve heard him talk about stretching and how it changed–not only his athletic performance and how he feels on a daily basis–his entire life. In his memoir, <a href="https://amzn.to/3rAj9L4">You Can’t Hurt Me</a>, David says:</p>


<blockquote><p>Thanks to all that stretching, I’m in better shape at forty-three than I was in my twenties. Back then I was always sick, wound tight, and stressed out. I never analyzed why I kept getting stress fractures. I just taped that shit up. No matter what ailed my body or my mind I had the same solution. Tape it up and move the fuck on. Now I’m smarter than I’ve ever been. And I’m still getting after it.</p><cite>David Goggins, <a href="https://amzn.to/3rAj9L4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="You Can't Hurt Me (opens in a new tab)">You Can’t Hurt Me</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Stretching Enhances Your Overall Flexibility and Range of Motion</h2>



<p>According to <span kcite-id="ITEM-91-0">(<a href="http://benwajdi.com/2020/12/26/you-need-to-start-stretching-now-here-are-the-benefits/10.1080/07303084.2008.10598237">10.1080/07303084.2008.10598237</a>)</span>, ” Stretching has been shown to improve flexibility, which was previously believed to improve performance and reduce the risk of injury .”  Although, the same article reminds us that other research <span kcite-id="ITEM-91-1">(<a href="http://benwajdi.com/2020/12/26/you-need-to-start-stretching-now-here-are-the-benefits/10.1080/07303084.1999.10605682"> 10.1080/07303084.1999.10605682 </a>)</span> “have suggested that stretching may decrease muscle strength, which would compromise performance.”</p>

<hr>



<p>However, a study by Herman, SL and Smith, Dt, published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research <span kcite-id="ITEM-91-2">(<a href="http://benwajdi.com/2020/12/26/you-need-to-start-stretching-now-here-are-the-benefits/10.1519/jsc.0b013e318173da50"> 10.1519/jsc.0b013e318173da50 </a>)</span>, in which they “incorporated a 4-week” dynamic stretching warmup (DWU) into the training program of a group of collegiate wrestlers and see how it affected their overall performance. They found out that the 4-week DWU intervention they incorporated, made positive improvements “in the majority of performance measures that assessed power,speed, agility, endurance, flexibility, and strength”. And according to the same study, “Sport-specific stretching exercises should be introduced into a warm-up immediately following the 2 to 3 minutes of light activity.”</p>



<h2>Stretching Can Prevent Injury</h2>



<p>There are four types of stretching techniques. Static, Dynamic, Ballistic, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation(PNF). Each has its pros and cons. And while the static option–holding a muscle in a fixed position for an extended period of time, after moving it past a certain range of motion and oftentimes anything past that point in ROM involves pain and we all experience it–is the most popular option, it is not always the most effective technique for injury prevention.</p>



<h2>Stretching Can Relieve Pain<br></h2>



<p>If you experience chronic pain, and you go visit your doctor, chances are beside drugs and scanning, he will advise you to join a yoga class. And what is yoga but a form of stretching!</p>



<p>” Stretching increases the flexibility of the tissues being stretched. It helps to loosen the tension in your muscles, de-stresses them, and thus helps you manage your mental stress as well, ” says Amy Stein author of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Heal Pelvic Pain (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2KTevH2" target="_blank">Heal Pelvic Pain</a>.</p>



<h2>Don’t take it too far</h2>



<p>“There are, however, reasons to be cautious about stretching to the limits of pain because of the risk of causing damage ” says Muanjai et al. <span kcite-id="ITEM-91-3">(<a href="http://benwajdi.com/2020/12/26/you-need-to-start-stretching-now-here-are-the-benefits/10.1007/s00421-017-3608-y"> 10.1007/s00421-017-3608-y</a>)</span> and so while stretching regularly may improve flexibility and increase your range of motion, don’t take it too far. The same study suggest that static stretching for a long period of time may even cause inflammation and loss of strength. So be careful and use it wisely.</p>



<p>Warmup for 10-15 minutes. Then, begin the stretching process immediately. Breathe in a slow rhythm that you are able to control. Do not bounce or move in a silly way lest you get yourself injured. The stretch should be gentle. You should reach a kind of pain sweet spot that you can maintain so that it is neither too easy and thus provide no stimuli nor too hard and therefore lead to injury. “The body, and in particular the body part being stretched, must not be under excessive tension, which explains why some athletes injure themselves after practicing their sport when they conclude their training with rough stretches, ” says Oscar Moran (<a href="https://amzn.to/34JqXA2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="author of this stretching encyclopedia (opens in a new tab)">author of this stretching encyclopedia</a>), and hence preferably, stretch before the exercise not after it.</p>

        <section id="main_content">
          <p>I just watched a <em>great</em> YouTube video, touching technical, political, and philosophical questions around the whole “who controls the algorithm” topic, from one of those multi-million subscriber channels, spending lots and lots of time and resources on researching and producing. The video was perfect, but the end did upset me slightly. In the end, the sponsoring message was read, and the sponsor was one of those VPN companies, with their usual marketing lingo. You surely know what I am talking about, but let me quote the sponsoring message here for context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your internet connection, right now, is broadcasting your IP address, which is the way people track you online. Check this out [shows a screencap of a website displaying the IP and GeoLocation information], when I go to this website, it tests everything that my internet connection is leaking. You can see my IP address, but you can also see where I am. Your internet connection is doing this right now. Here is how [VPN company] works: It is a Virtual Private Network, you turn it on with one click. My internet traffic is now encrypted, and going through [VPN company]s servers located throughout the world, so people can no longer figure out where I am located. I protect myself online with [VPN company]. […] There is a 30-day money back guarantee which I am confident you are not going to use, because I feel comforted knowing that my personal information is protected on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is another one, from a different channel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all the recent news about online security breaches, it is hard not to worry about where my data goes. Make an online purchase or simply accessing your email puts your private information at risk. You are being tracked online all the time by social media sites, marketing companies, and mobile internet providers. That is why you need to take your internet privacy back right now. Use [VPN company]! [VPN company] has the easiest apps that run seamlessly in the background of any computer, phone, and tablet. Turning on [VPN company] protection only takes one click. I am going to tell you what takes more than one click: getting your identity and data back after it’s been lost. Try getting back the money from your stolen credit cards. Do one click now. [VPN company] secures and anoymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data and hiding your public IP address.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The popularity of those services and the way they are recommended and promoted is bad. So bad that I feel impelled to write this article on it, to explain two problematic points. Those are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In most circumstances, <strong>VPNs do very little to enhance your data security or privacy</strong> unless paired with other changes.</li>
  <li>Acting as they do, and <strong>promoting commercial VPN providers</strong> as a solution to potential issues <strong>does more harm than good</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just stick around for a bit, and I will explain everything. Before I start, though, let me clarify that I am writing this post with non-technical, but curious people in mind. This means that I will be using simplified terms and sometimes generalize a bit. However, I can assure you that all information is still very accurate. Sometimes, using technical words is necessary to avoid this post becoming inaccurate. If you do not understand something, just read on, the next paragraph might be more apparent.</p>

<h2 id="what-a-vpn-is-and-what-it-is-not">What a VPN is, and what it is not.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] another worrying aspect of today’s market of VPN services is the large misinformation end users are exposed to, which makes it hard for them to properly tell apart vague and bold claims typical of product advertisement campaigns with actual facts.</p>

  <p>- <em>a <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/popets.2015.1.issue-1/popets-2015-0006/popets-2015-0006.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published in 2015</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://schub.wtf/statics/blog/20190408/vpn-banner.png" alt="VPN - a Very Precarious Narrative"></p>

<p>To start, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> has a very nice summary of what a VPN is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A VPN is a <em>tunnel</em> connecting two different networks. You throw traffic into one end of the tunnel, and it will come out somewhere else, even if the destination might not be reachable on the public internet. VPNs are popular in company environments: Imagine a large company running their servers with private sale data on them. The company does not want those servers to be reachable via the internet for security reasons, but at the same time, salespeople need to be able to access those datasets, even if they are on the road. The salesperson can use the company’s VPN to “move their laptop into the company network”, without the need to physically be there, so they have access to that information. In addition, network traffic sent over VPNs is generally encrypted, so even if the salesperson is using a maybe insecure network, the data is probably safe, if everything is configured correctly.</p>

<p>The VPNs that get advertised at the end of YouTube videos are different. They are not used to access protected, internal infrastructure. Instead, they are used to tunnel <em>all</em> network traffic into a datacenter you neither know nor can control in any way. To understand why this might be a bad idea and is absolutely not necessary in most cases, let’s look at the marketing claims.</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-is-used-for-tracking-and-leaks-private-information-you-should-hide-it">“Your IP is used for tracking and leaks private information. You should hide it.”</h2>

<p>One thing that most VPN advertisements have in common is some babble around IP addresses. Providers claim that your IP address leaks tons of private information, even your physical location, and they also claim that IP addresses are used for tracking. I call that fearmongering and deliberate misinformation.</p>

<p><img src="https://schub.wtf/statics/blog/20190408/vpn-check.jpg" alt="Two screenshots from VPN websites showing my &quot;unprotected&quot; IP address"></p>

<p>I am sure you have seen notices like these on VPN provider’s websites before. They claim that your IP can be used to track you, and they even show a map of where you are located to make it look scarier.</p>

<p>Before I address those two things, let me say something more generic. Notice how both sites show my IP, claim that my connection is “unprotected”, and one is even showing a map? Well. In reality, I am actually <em>using a VPN</em> in those screenshots, I just happened to use <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtonVPN</a> for this example, so I should be protected very well, right? How come they claim I am unprotected?</p>

<p>That is because those “tests” do not do anything useful. The only check these things are doing is a simple “is the user currently connected via one of our IPs, and thus is using our VPN? If yes, say the user is protected, otherwise, act like the world is on fire”. Not very productive.</p>

<h3 id="ip-addresses-for-user-identification">IP addresses for user identification</h3>

<p>One of the sponsor messages I quoted earlier explicitly claims that IP addresses are how you “are being tracked online all the time by social media sites and marketing companies”. But is that so? We all know that Facebook is pretty big in the whole “tracking people” business, so if you have an active subscription at one of those VPN providers and a Facebook account, let’s do a test together!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a new Private Window/Incognito Window in your favorite browser.</li>
  <li>In that window, open two tabs: Facebook, and the “What is my IP?” page of your VPN provider, like <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/what-is-my-ip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from ExpressVPN</a>.</li>
  <li>Log in to your Facebook account.</li>
  <li>With the VPN disabled, verify that the “test” site shows “you are unprotected”, like in my screenshots above.</li>
  <li>Connect to your VPN. Refresh the VPN test page, which should now say that your IP is hidden and your connection is protected. Right?</li>
  <li>Now, switch over to the Facebook tab, and hit reload.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what happened? Did Facebook forget who you are, and boot you back out to the login form? No, of course not. Even though your IP address changed, Facebook still knew <em>exactly</em> who you are. So do marketing companies and other tracking parties.</p>

<p>The reality here is that your IP address is only a tiny piece of your trackable profile and a pretty unreliable one as such. Tracking companies are interested in tracking <em>you</em>, not a specific device or a specific browsing session. Your IP changes all the time, take your mobile phone as an example: You may be connected to your home WiFi, to your mobile connection, the network at work, … and you will have a different IP in each network. Moreover, these IPs are not even unique to you in most cases: most mobile phone networks share their public IPs to hundreds, sometimes thousands of mobile phones in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAT</a>. Tracking companies have to distinguish between all those people - their profiles would be useless otherwise.</p>

<p>Tracking companies have far more advanced methods. One well-known identification method is <em>Cookies</em>, little portions of data in your browser or mobile client. However, since Cookies can easily be altered or removed by users, trackers came up with far more advanced technologies like browser fingerprinting and even running behavioral pattern recognition to uniquely identify users. All these things cannot be influenced or altered in any way by a VPN.</p>

<p>If you are worried about these things, then use a browser with integrated tracking protection features. In Firefox, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/facebook-container-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-Account Containers and the Facebook Container Extension</a> for example help by locking those tracking sites into their isolated sandbox, so they cannot track you when you are not actively using them. The whole “a VPN makes you browse anonymously” thing is just marketing.</p>

<h3 id="location-leaking">Location leaking</h3>

<p>Another very effective method these VPN marketing people are using is showing your location on their sites. This is very effective at scaring people since those sites hit either your actual hometown or a city nearby. Nobody wants to share their location publicly.</p>

<p>“Your IP address” is not leaking your home address.</p>

<p>You see, your modem is not connected to a cable that leads directly to your ISPs main router. Instead, your internet data is <em>merged together</em> with other peoples data on the way. ISPs split up their network into multiple segments to make their network more manageable, …</p></section></section></div>

							<p>TL;DR: If you have a Zyxel USG, ATP, VPN, ZyWALL or USG FLEX you should update to the latest firmware version today. You can find the full list of affected devices <a href="https://businessforum.zyxel.com/discussion/5252/zld-v4-60-revoke-and-wk48-firmware-release">here</a> and the Zyxel advisory <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/support/CVE-2020-29583.shtml">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>Zyxel is a popular brand for firewalls that are marketed towards small and medium businesses. Their Unified Security Gateway (USG) product line is often used as a firewall or VPN gateway. As a lot of us are working from home, VPN-capable devices have been quite selling well lately.</p>
                            <p>When doing some research (rooting) on my Zyxel USG40, I was surprised to find a user account 'zyfwp' with a password hash in the latest firmware version (4.60 patch 0). The plaintext password was visible in one of the binaries on the system. I was even more surprised that this account seemed to work on both the SSH and web interface.</p>

                            <p>The user is not visible in the interface and its password cannot be changed. I checked the previous firmware version (4.39) and although the user was present, it did not have a password. It seemed the vulnerability had been introduced in the latest firmware version. Even though older versions do not have this vulnerability, they do have others (such as this <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/us/en/support/Zyxel-security-advisory-for-buffer-overflow-vulnerability.shtml">buffer overflow</a>) so you should still update.</p>
                            <p>As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface, a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar, I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally, more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet.</p>
                            <p>In our experience, most users of these devices will not update the firmware very often. Zyxel devices do not expose their firmware version to unauthenticated users, so determining if a device is vulnerable is a bit more difficult. We wanted to get an idea of the amount of affected devices, but simply trying the password is not really an option (ethically and legally). Luckily, some javascript and css files can be requested from the web interface of these devices without authentication. These files seem to change with every firmware release. Using this information, we can obtain a unique fingerprint of the vulnerable firmware version. We used this information to identify the firmware version of 1.000 devices in The Netherlands and found that around 10% of devices are running the affected firmware version. Zyxel does offer automatic updates, but these are not enabled by default. Luckily, we were able to find this vulnerability just a few weeks after it had been introduced, or the number of affected devices could have been much larger.</p>
                            <p>As the zyfwp user has admin privileges, this is a serious vulnerability. An attacker could completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the device. Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device.  Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses.</p>
                            <p>Because of the seriousness of the vulnerability and it being so easy to exploit, we have decided not to release the password for this account at this time. We do expect others to find and release it, which is why we suggest you install the updated firmware as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>I quickly sent out a mail to Zyxel to report the undocumented user account. According to Zyxel, the account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates for access points via FTP. They released a fixed firmware version less than two weeks later. You can find the release notes for the USG40 <a href="ftp://ftp.zyxel.com/USG40/firmware/USG40_4.60(AALA.1)C0_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>This is the entry in the release notes that describes this vulnerability:</p>

Thank you all!</p><p>I have a small request:</p><div><div><div> <h3>Share This On Twitter</h3><p>If you find this useful, please share on Twitter, thank you!</p></div></div></div><h2 id="whos-this-tutorial-for"><a href="#whos-this-tutorial-for" aria-label="whos this tutorial for permalink"></a>Who’s this tutorial for?</h2><p>This series of compiler tutorials is for people who don’t just want to create a <em>toy</em> language.
You want objects. You want polymorphism. You want concurrency. You want garbage collection. Wait you don’t want GC? Okay, no worries, we won’t do that :P</p><p>If you’ve just joined the series at this stage, here’s a quick recap. We’re designing a Java-esque concurrent object-oriented programming language <em>Bolt</em>. We’ve gone through the compiler frontend, where we’ve done the parsing, type-checking and dataflow analysis. We’ve <a href="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/lower-language-constructs-to-llvm/">desugared our language to get it ready for LLVM</a> - the main takeaway is that objects have been desugared to structs, and their methods desugared to functions.</p><p>Learn about LLVM and you’ll be the envy of your friends. Rust uses LLVM for its backend, so it must be cool. You’ll beat them on all those performance benchmarks, without having to hand-optimise your code or write machine assembly code. Shhhh, I won’t tell them.</p><h2 id="just-give-me-the-code"><a href="#just-give-me-the-code" aria-label="just give me the code permalink"></a>Just give me the code!</h2><p>All the code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt">Bolt compiler repository</a>.</p><p>The C++ class definitions for our desugared representation (we call this <em>Bolt IR</em>) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/deserialise_ir">deserialise_ir</a> folder. The code for this post (the LLVM IR generation) can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/llvm_ir_codegen">llvm_ir_codegen</a> folder. The repo uses the Visitor design pattern and ample use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to make memory management easier.</p><p>To cut through the boilerplate, to find out how to generate LLVM IR for a particular language expression, search for the <code>IRCodegenVisitor::codegen</code> method that takes in the corresponding <code>ExprIR</code> object. e.g. for if-else statements:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>Value </span><span>*</span><span>IRCodegenVisitor</span><span>::</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprIfElseIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="understanding-llvm-ir"><a href="#understanding-llvm-ir" aria-label="understanding llvm ir permalink"></a>Understanding LLVM IR</h2><p>LLVM sits in the <strong>middle-end</strong> of our compiler, <em>after</em> we’ve desugared our language features, but <em>before</em> the backends that target specific machine architectures (x86, ARM etc.)</p><p>LLVM’s IR is pretty low-level, it can’t contain language features present in some languages but not others (e.g. classes are present in C++ but not C). If you’ve come across instruction sets before, LLVM IR is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer#:~:text=A%20reduced%20instruction%20set%20computer,instruction%20set%20computer%20(CISC).">RISC</a> instruction set.</p><p>The upshot of it is that LLVM IR looks like a more <em>readable</em> form of assembly. As LLVM IR is <strong>machine independent</strong>, we don’t need to worry about the number of registers, size of datatypes, calling conventions or other machine-specific details.</p><p>So instead of a fixed number of physical registers, in LLVM IR we have an unlimited set of <em>virtual</em> registers (labelled <code>%0</code>, <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, <code>%3</code>… we can write and read from. It’s the backend’s job to map from virtual to physical registers.</p><p>And rather than allocating specific sizes of datatypes, we retain <strong>types</strong> in LLVM IR. Again, the backend will take this type information and map it to the size of the datatype. LLVM has types for different sizes of <code>int</code>s and floats, e.g. <code>int32</code>, <code>int8</code>, <code>int1</code> etc. It also has derived types: like <strong>pointer</strong> types, <strong>array</strong> types, <strong>struct</strong> types, <strong>function</strong> types. To find out more, check out the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html">Type</a> documentation.</p><p>Now, built into LLVM are a set of optimisations we can run over the LLVM IR e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination">dead-code elimination</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function inlining</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-common-subexpr.html">common subexpression elimination</a> etc. The details of these algorithms are irrelevant: LLVM implements them for us.</p><p>Our side of the bargain is that we write LLVM IR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static Single Assignment (SSA) form</a>, as SSA form makes life easier for optimisation writers. SSA form sounds fancy, but it just means we define variables before use and assign to variables <strong>only once</strong>. In SSA form, we cannot reassign to a variable, e.g. <code>x = x+1</code>; instead we assign to a fresh variable each time (<code>x2 = x1 + 1</code>).</p><p>So in short: LLVM IR looks like assembly with <strong>types</strong>, minus the messy machine-specific details. LLVM IR must be in SSA form, which makes it easier to optimise. Let’s look at an example!</p><h3 id="an-example-factorial"><a href="#an-example-factorial" aria-label="an example factorial permalink"></a>An example: Factorial</h3><p>Let’s look at a simple factorial function in our language Bolt:</p><div><p><span>factorial.bolt</span></p><div><pre><p><span>function </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> n</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>==</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>else</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    n </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>The corresponding LLVM IR is as follows:</p><div><p><span>factorial.ll</span></p><div><pre><p><span>define i32 @</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>entry</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>eq </span><span>=</span><span> icmp eq i32 </span><span>%</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>   </span><span></span></p><p><span>  br i1 </span><span>%</span><span>eq</span><span>,</span><span> label </span><span>%</span><span>then</span><span>,</span><span> label </span><span>%</span><span>else</span><span></span></p><p><span>then</span><span>:</span><span>                                             </span><span>;</span><span> preds </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>entry</span></p><p><span>  br label </span><span>%</span><span>ifcont</span></p><p><span></span><span>else</span><span>:</span><span>                                             </span><span>;</span><span> preds </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>entry</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>sub </span><span>=</span><span> sub i32 </span><span>%</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>   </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> call i32 @</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>i32 </span><span>%</span><span>sub</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>mult </span><span>=</span><span> mul i32 </span><span>%</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>  br label </span><span>%</span><span>ifcont</span></p><p><span>ifcont</span><span>:</span><span>                                           </span><span>;</span><span> preds </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>else</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>then</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>%</span><span>iftmp </span><span>=</span><span> phi i32 </span><span>[</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>then </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>mult</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>%</span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ret i32 </span><span>%</span><span>iftmp</span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Note the <code>.ll</code> extension is for <strong>human-readable</strong> LLVM IR output.

<p>There is a belief in biology that goes like this: Biology is messy. Nature has no interest in making things easy to understand. So for many scientific questions, there will not be a straight-forward answer.</p>



<ul><li><em>Q: Where and how is a particular memory stored in the brain? </em>A: Biology is messy; memories are distributed all over the brain and stored in many different forms: as molecules and as structure, inside neurons and in the connections between them.</li><li><em>Q: How do genes determine the number of fingers per hand? </em>A: Biology is messy; there isn’t a single factor for it. It emerges from the interactions of numerous different genes.</li></ul>



<p>Now it is not always the case that our answers are so unsatisfying. Ask a biologist how the eye works and, well, there are quite a lot of similarities to how cameras work. And living organisms aren’t messy globs of formless flesh. They have an organized body plan, with separate organs, each responsible for specific functions that we can talk about; the heart pumps blood and the lungs pump air.</p>



<p>What we mean when we say “biology is messy” is that biology is <em>as messy as it can be</em>. Sometimes, biological systems need to abide by certain principles to accomplish things. The principles of optics drove the eye to include an adjustable lens, an adjustable aperture, and a two dimensional sensor upon which images are projected. </p>



<p>When we humans design something we try to make them as organized and intelligible as possible. When nature designs things they usually end up being messier than they need to be. In other words: <strong>biology is messy, unless it cannot afford to be.</strong> Natural selection does not care about elegance for the sake of elegance. Nature selects for traits and features that help organisms survive and reproduce. And if most of the solutions to a problem are messy, it will most probably pick a messy strategy. But if there is a cost associated with messiness that entails a selective disadvantage, then nature will tend to select a non-messy strategy.</p>



<hr>



<p>Here is why I usually dislike it when people say “biology is messy”. <strong><span>When the <em>messiness of biology</em> is invoked, it is usually to rationalize why we don’t have an easy to understand explanation for some biological process</span></strong> (as is the case for the two example questions above). But we don’t know if this is because a simple explanation does not exist, or because we simply haven’t found it yet. <strong><span>Everything looks messy until you really understand how it works</span></strong>. This is even true for man-made devices like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/pdf/S1535-6108(02)00133-2.pdf" target="_blank">radios</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268" target="_blank">microprocessors</a>.</p>



<p>A historical example of how appealing to the messiness of biology can be misleading, is the old idea that genes are proteins. This was a widespread belief among biologists until the discovery of DNA. People used to think that inheritable traits emerged from the protein composition of a cell. The collection of proteins led one cell to become a turtle and one cell to turn into a butterfly. That idea was a far messier – less elegant – solution than having genes be written into strings of nucleotide (more on this later).</p>



<hr>



<p>There is one particular usage of the “<em>biology is messy</em>” statement, that can actually be productive in my view. If we believe that “biology is messy unless it cannot afford to be” then we ought to believe in its corollary. <strong><span>In situations where biology is not messy, it is because it cannot afford to be messy due to some fundamental principles or constraints</span></strong>. We often run into things in biology that look like things humans design. When this happens, it suggests that there are some principles of design that are inherent to the problem at hand. We can then search for those principles that led nature to select a conceptually clean and simple solution, similar to how the evolution of the vertebrate eye was guided by the principles of optics to function an awful lot like a camera.</p>



<p>Take the the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/13/gears-evolved-nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovery</a> of mechanical gears in insects, for instance. Gears are quite common in machines designed by humans. It is a conceptually simple solution for transferring torque between unaligned axes. Gears were not known to exist in nature until the discovery of functional mechanical gears in tiny insects called planthoppers. The planthopper’s gears synchronize the two hindlegs during a jumps.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="586" src="http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Interactive_gears_in_the_hind_legs_of_Issus_coleoptratus_from_Cambridge_gears-3.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Interactive_gears_in_the_hind_legs_of_Issus_coleoptratus_from_Cambridge_gears-3.jpg 660w, http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Interactive_gears_in_the_hind_legs_of_Issus_coleoptratus_from_Cambridge_gears-3-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></figure></div>



<p>Why would nature come up with such a neat solution? Leg synchronization is possible without gears. So why does it only appear in the planthopper, but nowhere else in the animal kingdom? There must be something about its purpose that could not have been easily achieved without gears.</p>



<p>The answer probably lies in the fact that, due to their small size, planthoppers only have less than a millisecond to accelerate. Within a span of 0.8ms they need to accelerate at over 700g to reach speeds of nearly 5 meters per second (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/17/2844" target="_blank">Burrow, 2007</a>). This is an exceptional regime of acceleration and requires sub-millisecond coordination of leg movement. If one legs starts moving half a millisecond earlier, the other leg would barely have any time left to push against the surface.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1240284" target="_blank">Burrow &amp; Suttons, 2013</a>, if leg movements are slightly uncoordinated during a jump the planthopper would spin, uncontrollably, in the horizontal plane. This is because the hindlegs rotate on a nearly horizontal plane underneath the body in planthoppers (whereas hindlegs of fleas and crickets rotate on separate vertical plane alongside the body).  The gears provide a method of mechanical synchronization, enabling the legs to move within roughly 30 μs of one another.</p>



<p>But this is not the full story and there are still many unsolved questions regarding why gears evolved. Planthoppers lose their gears after they molt into adults and yet are nearly just as good at jumping. Adult planthoppers use a friction-based method of leg synchronization. Why was that not an adequate solution for younger nymphs? Leafhoppers and froghoppers, which also rotate their hindlegs in a nearly horizontal plane, jump without using mechanical gears. Froghoppers achieve very precise movement synchronization between their hindlegs (32±22 μs, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1406.short" target="_blank">Burrow &amp; Sutton 2010</a>). (I learned from my personal correspondence with Prof Burrow that the synchronization mechanism in froghoppers is unknown but likely to be mechanical).</p>



<p>The point here is that <strong><span>the presence of gears is an indication of some principles of design that is common across natural and artificial systems</span></strong>. (Can you identify those principles? What can gears do that other strategies cannot fulfill?) While those design principles can be ignored in most animals, the behavioral requirements in planthopper are so stringent that they have forced those principles onto the biological scene. <span>(I am not convinced that we have identified all those requirements, since froghoppers and adult planthoppers seem to be just fine without gears)</span>.</p>



<p>But if we’re dedicated to the <em>biology is messy</em> assumption, we should be motivated to further investigate planthopper behavior/physiology until we find something that make those gears seem indispensable. <span>(We are already very close to finding it and the idea of it having to do with the size of the insect has already been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1240284" target="_blank">formulated</a>)</span>. Now, it would be quite impressive if someone had gone the opposite route: predicted the existence of gears simply from studying planthopper behavior and the physics of jumping in small creatures. Would that have been possible?</p>



<hr>



<p>This brings us to another domain of nature that is the main reason I am bringing up all of this. DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides or strings made up of an alphabet of four symbols. The cell appears to treat these nucleotides as abstract symbols that can be used to represent arbitrary things. The cell represents each of the 20 amino acid using a sequences of three nucleotides called <em>codons</em>. Some codons represent, not an amino acid, but an instruction to “stop” at the end of a sequence. What an elegant intelligible system! How reminiscent of the way computers use strings of binary symbols to encode data and instructions!</p>



<p>I would like to leave you with this question: <span><strong>Why do all living organisms use strings of abstract symbols?</strong></span> Or, under the <em>biology is messy</em> assumption, what functions are being fulfilled by DNA and RNA that would be difficult to fulfill through messier methods? What requirements forced digital coding through strings composed of a small alphabet onto the biological scene? Hopefully, you don’t think the answer is trivial. I will let you think about it and return to this question in a future post.</p>

    <p>The Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus is a set of word associations; if you hear the word  <i>library</i> what word would first come to mind?  This is what researchers who published with Edinburgh University Press sought to find.</p><p>The surveys took place among college students in the UK in the early 1970s, so the results will be understandably affected by biases of time, place, and demographics.  Even so, I've found the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus to be a useful tool,  particularly for word games like Password and Pyramid, and particularly since such  empirical data sets are difficult to come by.  However, to my dismay, it appears that  the main page hosting a web form for querying the Thesaurus is offline.  (There are still  <a href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/dic/eat/Eat.htm">copies</a>  of the Thesaurus data online.)</p><p>I've taken the effort to remedy this somewhat by making my own form using data from the Thesaurus.  Type in a word or string in the input field below and click the "Find word assocations" button.</p><p>Please note:</p><ol><li>You don't need to worry about typing in upper or lower case.  Searches are case-insensitive.</li><li>There's no stemming -- searches are exact, so the results of "read" versus "reading" will differ.</li><li>Results are sorted in descending order by the number of "hits" (responses in the original survey).</li><li>Results are solely in the direction stimlulus-to-response.  You're typing in a stimulus term and seeing what responses, if any, are in the Thesaurus.</li><li>Results, if any, appear below the form.</li></ol>  <p>The source code is available online <a href="https://github.com/msszczep/eat-cljs">here</a> and is  based on the source for my <a href="https://github.com/msszczep/subanagram-cljs">Subanagram generator in Clojurescript</a>.  Thanks to Darius Kazemi for <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/ea-thesaurus">providing a JSON version of the Thesaurus, which I used in this app</a>.</p>

I hate to think how simulated phishes such as GoDaddy's "$650 one-time bonus" (<a href="https://twitter.com/lolonghi/status/1341863667290140672">1</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/godaddy-sent-fake-phising-email-promising-holiday-bonus-220756457.html">2</a>) and Tribune Publishing's "up to $10,000" (<a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308839731443179520">1</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2020/09/23/tribune-bonus-email-phishing-hoax/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/23/tribune-publishing-apologizes-fake-bonus-offer-phishing-simulation-email/">3</a>) have affected trust and morale within those organizations. What benefits did those efforts really offer to their stakeholders?</p>
<p>Phishing is the fraudulent use of email to trick a target into giving up personal / sensitive information (via reply to email, or submission of a web form), or perhaps taking some other action with consequences (opening an attachment, making a phone call, executing a business process). It's real, it's constant, and the impact can be high.</p>
<p>Phishing simulation (aka. simulated phishing, phishing test, fake phishing) is the crafting of "fake" phishing emails by a trusted party (generally a security team) targetting members of their own organizations. They'll generally track and educate (shame?) those who fall for the fake phish. There are various vendors that have the ideal solution to help you execute simulated phishing. Phishing is a risk to be managed, yes... but simulated phishing also presents risk.</p>

<p>Even if you're not to going to the extent of the terrible examples above, here are several questions to consider as a security team before running your own phishing simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is responsibility for fighting off phishing attacks primarily across all employees? Yes, they have some responsibility, but there's an argument to be made that primary responsbility for this must sit with the security team who has the experience and resources to affect change. If this is the case, then a focus on testing of the security team and associated controls/systems seems more appropriate. ("Security is everyone's responsibility" feels like a tired old trope that is given too much weight, but that's a discussion for another time.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you done the work to reduce exposure to and impact of phishing? As a security team, you should probably have implemented email security features (SPF/DKIM/DMARC/new-hotness, anti-spoofing rules, content filtering, etc), strong authentication mechanisms (multi-factor!), effective endpoint controls (both  prevention and detection!), and resilient business processes - among other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is organizational perception of and interaction with your security team affected? There's a very significant likelihood that phishing simulation exercises may reduce trust or increase friction between the security team and others. There's somewhat a juxtaposition at the intersection of working to build a positive working relationship with folks who you're also trying to "trick" or "test".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is "phishing awareness" really what you want to focus on? Ideally, the security team should be setting your organization up for success with a broad and healthy awareness of a range of security threats, not just phishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you clear on goals? What is the security team hoping to learn? You already know that people click links and open attachments, and more specifically that people fall for phishing emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is your simulation realistic? If you have existing anti-phishing controls within your email system, you probably shouldn't bypass them for the sake of a simulation. Also, just because a recipient "clicked a link", that doesn't mean an undesired security outcome would have eventuated and there are likely nuanced lessons to be learned from any simulation results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have reasonable visibility into actual phishing activity, and is the security team able to respond appropriately? (See alternative #1 below.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there value to be gained by testing employees, vs testing security controls? (See alternative #2 below.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As an alternative to simulated phishing, can you track actual phishing activity? As phishing attempts are reported to or detected by your security team, investigate and check for message opens/reads, unique/harmful URL access, outbound replies to sending addresses, etc. Proactively block or yank known-bad messages. Use resulting data and metrics to tune anti-phishing, email platform, endpoint protection, and broader security controls and also to monitor employee response to known-bad emails.</p>
<p>There are going to be privacy trade-offs to consider here; in perception or reality, "big brother" is not always welcome!</p>

<p>As another alternative to simulated phishing, instead of testing the <em>susceptibility</em> of random employees to a pseudo-phish, how about testing the <em>vulnerability</em> of security controls across broader systems and processes to phishing-associated events and outcomes? Have members of your security team or other trusted partners execute various phishing-related actions in a controlled fashion and learn from the results.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Craft various spoofed/faked phishing messages and send them from external/untrusted sources to <em>briefed, read-in</em> internal recipients - start with members of your own security team! Does your email system and its security mechanisms operate effectively, or does the phishing message make it through to the recipient's email client intact? Are there any indicators in the email client that they should be suspicious? How can you improve these mechanisms/indicators?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume the disclosure of Active Directory (or O365, or Gsuite, or Okta, or [high-value target]) credentials for an employee account and attempt to use those credentials from an untrusted system/location. Do they result in unauthorized access to the system, or is there another control (strong multi-factor authentication!) that makes the credentials relatively worthless? If the former, does least-privilege mean the account credentials only get an attacker so far, or do they allow an unacceptable breadth/depth of access?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Click the link" or open a malicious attachment on a standard end-user system (with additional safeguards/sandboxing/monitoring, if deemed necessary), and observe. Is this going to results in exposure or breach of data and systems, or does an endpoint protection mechanism kick in and minimize the impact? Does your security monitoring detect the event and alert appropriately?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempt to execute an unauthorized financial transaction (with appropriate selective awareness on finance/exec teams). Have the business processes, communications methods, and approval chains been designed and implemented such that a purported "urgent request from the CEO" will not result in financial loss?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the keys to these four examples is that <em>it is members of the security team (or trusted partners) triggering the test scenarios</em>. This removes the "trickery" element required when targetting random employees, and takes away the "shaming" element when somebody inevitably does fall for a simulated phish.</p>
<p>Performing testing of this type has potential to provide much deeper insight into the effectiveness of your security program, and keeps primary responsibility for security where it belongs - with your team! The usable signal you get from this testing, and opportunities for improvement identified, should significantly exceed the results of a simulated phishing exercise.</p>

<p>Said it before, I'll say it again... don't be a jerk! Be conscious of how specific simulated phishes are crafted / structured and what pretexts you're attempting to utilize. Consider the environment, moment, and mindset that the targets are in. Don't just "do whatever it takes" to get that click.</p>
<p>"A criminal would do it, so we should too" is not justification for abuse or mistreatment (or making it look like someone is getting an unexpected bonus). Simulated phishing is not the only way to address all scenarios or pretexts, and you have other options to such as various flavors of training and awareness.</p>

<p>If you must do simulated phishing, do it thoughtfully and don't be a jerk. Before you do simulated phishing, consider the alternatives!</p>
<p>(If this didn't mean much to you, and you're only here because the many uses of the word "phishing" somehow landed you here ... don't get phished! Know <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams">how to recognize and avoid phishing scams</a>.)</p>

<p>Do you ever wonder if we’ve missed some essential nutrient that’s in real food, but not accounted for in meal replacements? I mean, not discovered some vitamin, protein, or other essential nutrient yet? I do. And I guess the problem is potentially worse, given the microbiome that we’ve barely started to explore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do I idly wonder or worry about it? No. Am I constantly investigating new and lesser-known nutrients and compounds that may turn out to have health benefits? Pretty much, yes. Do I add them all to the formula?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/hau0q3/should_we_add_creatine_to_athlete_fuel_super_body/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">No</a>. But there are some that I have, like the DHA and Myo-Inositol, after careful consideration of the research and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/dkbnwg/pumpkin_spice_and_strawberry_are_back_at_super/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey&nbsp;feedback</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think about this as a comparison between a hubristically engineered attempt at playing god on the part of humans, versus a perfect, divinely ordained natural diet that completely and optimally meets the body’s needs. If those were the two choices, I would not be wasting my time with this business, and you would not be a customer.</p>
<p>Instead, we have a comparison between a deliberate, thoughtful diet plan depending largely on supplements for micronutrient content, and a largely naive, haphazard diet based on learned behaviors and impulses within a food landscape overwhelmingly shaped by market forces that have no regard for nutritional content whatsoever. Traditional pre-industrial diets, as <a href="https://michaelpollan.com/books/the-omnivores-dilemma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Pollan</a> describes, are somewhere in between, but are largely dying out (tragically) and our customers are not generally coming from that background. If they are, the forces pushing them are due to the long-term societal effects of colonialism and capitalism, and Super Body Fuel is merely an attempt to ease the pain, not itself the cause.</p>
<p><a href="https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Milk Fuel</a>&nbsp;has the exact same amount of “real food” as a bowl of oat-based cereal in milk, and&nbsp;<a href="https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">all of Super Body Fuel</a>&nbsp;has more “real food” than a bowl of oatmeal. And yet most people would reflexively assume that the bowl of oatmeal has some mysterious nutrient that is somehow lacking in&nbsp;<a href="https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Super Fuel</a>. Sadly, in fact, it is the opposite. The bowl of oatmeal is definitely – measurably – deficient in over a dozen nutrients that you will suffer known medical problems for lacking, and eventually die without. And many of these nutrients you cannot get in a multivitamin pill (fiber and electrolytes are too bulky to fit, and most multivitamins also include only cheap forms of vitamins and minerals that are not absorbed well).</p>
<p>This extends to the entirety of the diet. Americans as a population are known, <a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">as documented in government reports</a>, to be clearly deficient in many nutrients (even by the minimal standards of the FDA), including insoluble and soluble&nbsp;<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">fiber</a>&nbsp;(back to the gut bacteria!),&nbsp;<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/potassium" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">potassium</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/magnesium" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">magnesium</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-K" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">vitamin K</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-D" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">vitamin D</a>, to a degree that causes significant health issues to individuals and incurs significant healthcare costs to society.</p>
<p>It’s almost infuriating how backwards this is – it’s easy to get worked up about this if I let myself. :p</p>
<p>Do you see what I’m saying? It’s not traditional pre-industrial diets and Cheerios with milk, grouped together as “real food” against the “fake food” of Super Body Fuel. Cheerios with milk has much more in common with SBF than it does with any pre-industrial diet. And SBF does everything better than Cheerios. <em>Except marketing.</em> ;) It’s just the next logical step in making industrial food less terrible – indeed, taking it into the realm of (hopefully!) optimal.</p>
<p>Believe me, I wish we didn’t have to do this – I came to SBF from a Paleo diet. <strong>But this is where we are, as a society.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seems we’ve gotten very far from the track, and you’re very right that SBF only needs to be doing better, overall. It’s certainly succeeding in that for me. Aside from all the capitalist marketing of food for questionable reasons, I love to think I could grow my own food, raise my own animals, and somehow really nourish my body on every level, but I just don’t have the right skills, resources, or time for it. And I’ve plenty of other things to deal with.</p>
<p>Are you aware of Bikini, the island where a huge nuke was set off? These days, the natives live almost entirely on processed food: I guess because local food is questionable or non-existent, and everything is shipped in from the US. It has the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the world. I guess that’s what happens when you nuke the land and sea, nuke a traditional, energetic way of life, and then people live on canned crap :(</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original founder of&nbsp;<a href="https://goactualize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Actualize</a>, Dr. Sepah, actually wrote a series of blog posts about this whole issue a while back, called&nbsp;<a href="https://goactualize.com/blogs/news/the-cure-for-obesity-is-processed-food-when-the-poison-is-the-antidote-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Cure for Obesity is Processed Food</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth a read if you haven’t already.&nbsp;<a href="https://goactualize.com/blogs/news/the-cure-for-obesity-and-diabetes-is-processed-food-part-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Part 3</a> is about ‘lents (complete foods, or what he calls “Nutrifoods”).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the_beat_goes_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/the_beat_goes_on</a> asks:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apparently phytochemicals are important, and absent from ‘lents. Maybe that would qualify as a missing nutrient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that is the most reasonable complaint, and the most easily addressed.</p>
<p>Obviously, something like Cheerios has no more phytonutrient content than Super Fuel (both have certain beneficial compounds from the oat flour). But what about fruits and veggies? Like, for people who actually do eat somewhat healthily.</p>
<p>One point is that Super Fuel (but not Soylent) has phytonutrients not only from meager grains like oats or brown rice, but from superfoods like monkfruit and cocoa powder (or Ceylon cinnamon, or freeze-dried strawberries, depending on the flavor) which are rich in antioxidant phytochemicals. That’s one of the reasons we use&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;spices for the flavors, not isolated flavor compounds (and one of the reasons that people historically have used spices in cooking!).</p>
<p>Another point is that it’s possible to actually include phytonutrients in ‘lents, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/IcyElemental/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">u/IcyElemental</a> of <a href="https://genesisfoods.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis Foods</a> does with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenesisFoods/comments/8chbyd/how_do_you_decide_what_to_add_to_phytogenesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">PhytoGenesis</a>. I’ve tended to move a little slower and cautiously in terms of adding things, but there are some science-backed phytonutrients and other things that are not strictly vitamins or minerals that I’ve started adding, and more that I’d like to add in the future. It’s just a matter of time, and there’s no reason why ‘lents can’t include them just as easily as they include vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p><strong>But the biggest thing is this.</strong></p>
<p>Even if ‘lents are lacking in crucial phytonutrients, your average meal, even a “healthy” meal with phytonutrient-packed veggies, is still lacking in even more crucial&nbsp;<em>actual vitamins and minerals</em>.</p>
<p>The phytonutrients are not considered vitamins because they have&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;been shown to be necessary in patients on long-term parenteral nutrition. If and when they do cause issues by being absent from parenteral nutrition, they will&nbsp;<em>become upgraded to vitamins</em>. That’s more or less how <a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/choline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choline</a> went from being a B vitamin, to not, to basically becoming one again, <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the FDA</a>.</p>
<p>The kind of medical problems you get from lacking vitamins and minerals are the kinds that are severe and obvious. The kinds of medical problems that may or may not be reduced in likelihood by phytonutrients that have not yet passed the “vitamin” test are by definition&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;as critical.</p>
<p>So, imagine your ‘lent and your healthy salad, or your grilled steak, or whatever, as two gladiators in the ring, fighting to the death. <strong>Who is healthier?</strong></p>
<p>Your favorite ‘lent has a helmet, a shield, a sword. He’s got all the bases covered, all the essentials. But he forgot to put on sunscreen. He’s missing his sunscreen – that’s the missing phytonutrient in this analogy. His skin is going to be uncomfortable tomorrow after a hard day of fighting in the Mediterranean sun. :/</p>
<p>But your healthy salad has his sunscreen. Great. But he’s missing his helmet. His shield is cracked. His sword is too short. These are the essential vitamins and minerals that are deficient or just straight up absent from the meal. You’ve got vitamin K1 in that salad, but how about K2? And where’s the B12? How much of that zinc or magnesium are you actually absorbing from those seeds? How much potassium or magnesium are you actually getting in that steak?</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think is going to win?</strong></p>
<p>Unless you are actively applying a systematic, nutrition-first approach to your “healthy” meals (like the&nbsp;<a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/the-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Perfect Health Diet</a>, maybe) I can almost guarantee that you are going to be deficient in something important. Even if you take a cheap Costco multivitamin at the same time. Still not getting that potassium or magnesium, not getting that K2, not getting enough omega-3 fats relative to your inflammatory omega-6, not getting enough fiber to keep your gut bacteria happy.</p>
<p>Phytonutrients are great, but they’re no substitute for essential nutrition.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/prettyunlikely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/prettyunlikely</a> adds:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a very thoughtful post and I wholeheartedly agree. Complete foods are not necessarily replacements for nutritionally balanced whole foods diets. But it would be extremely naive to believe that’s what is being replaced here.</p>
<p>I also think the way ‘lents started out was quite beautiful because of the open source recipes and ingredient transparency. A lot more intentionality has gone into making ‘lents than the majority of the breakfast cereal industry.</p>
<p>On a side note, the marketing machine behind the breakfast cereal industry is unbelievable, because it has somehow made us think that eating bowls of predominantly sugar and processed carbohydrates every morning is somehow healthy and great for children.</p>
<p>The world would be better off if we replaced all breakfast cereals and instant ramen with ‘lents.</p>
<p>And that’s what the messaging should be: take a typical diet of what people actually eat every day and compare it to a complete food diet, not the pie in the sky ideas of what people think would be healthy, but what people really put in their mouths every day.</p>
<p>Someone who eats a muffin or bagel for breakfast every day should switch to ‘lents. Someone who eats a sandwich from most fast food restaurants for lunch every day would almost certainly be better off with ‘lents instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like it or not, this is a topic that we’ll have …</p></div></div></div>

It is estimated that by 2050, antibiotic-resistant infections could claim 10 million lives each year and impose a cumulative $100 trillion burden on the global economy. The list of bacteria that are becoming resistant to treatment with all available antibiotic options is growing and few new drugs are in the pipeline, creating a pressing need for new classes of antibiotics to prevent public health crises. </p><p>“We took a creative, double-pronged strategy to develop new molecules that can kill difficult-to-treat infections while enhancing the natural host immune response,” said <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwistar.org%2Four-scientists%2Ffarokh-dotiwala&amp;t=ZWRjNmQzOGY2YjJjN2Y5YzA1NGRhNzQ0YTdmZTdmYTE5MWNjZWUyMSx2TVBmZ0tzTg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638507012246962176%2Fnovel-antibiotics-class&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159723">Farokh Dotiwala, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, assistant professor in the Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center and lead author of the effort to identify a new generation of antimicrobials named dual-acting immuno-antibiotics (DAIAs). </p><p>Existing antibiotics target essential bacterial functions, including nucleic acid and protein synthesis, building of the cell membrane, and metabolic pathways. However, bacteria can acquire drug resistance by mutating the bacterial target the antibiotic is directed against, inactivating the drugs or pumping them out. </p><p>“We reasoned that harnessing the immune system to simultaneously attack bacteria on two different fronts makes it hard for them to develop resistance,” said Dotiwala.</p><p>He and colleagues focused on a metabolic pathway that is essential for most bacteria but absent in humans, making it an ideal target for antibiotic development. This pathway, called methyl-D-erythritol phosphate (MEP) or non-mevalonate pathway, is responsible for biosynthesis of isoprenoids — molecules required for cell survival in most pathogenic bacteria. The lab targeted the IspH enzyme, an essential enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis, as a way to block this pathway and kill the microbes. Given the broad presence of IspH in the bacterial world, this approach may target a wide range of bacteria. </p><p>Researchers used computer modeling to screen several million commercially available compounds for their ability to bind with the enzyme, and selected the most potent ones that inhibited IspH function as starting points for drug discovery.</p><p>Since previously available IspH inhibitors could not penetrate the bacterial cell wall, Dotiwala collaborated with Wistar’s medicinal chemist <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwistar.org%2Four-scientists%2Fjoseph-salvino&amp;t=MTA5OTI4OGUxN2FhYzk5NzgzOGFmNjU4MTMyMzIxMjhhMTllYmYwMSx2TVBmZ0tzTg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638507012246962176%2Fnovel-antibiotics-class&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159723">Joseph Salvino, Ph.D.</a>, professor in The Wistar Institute Cancer Center and a co-senior author on the study, to identify and synthesize novel IspH inhibitor molecules that were able to get inside the bacteria.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1161"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7ded80bcfb9d5c7a58928160401c0658/a64f4c2145ca1551-72/s1280x1920/8825881c16af26c9d1608fc30a8f0c54ceae4885.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1161" width="1280" height="1032"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Flourescence microscopy staining showing the effects of DAIA treatment on bacteria viability.

<p>The Raspberry Pi family of devices is a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They are all based on Broadcom System-on-a-chip (SOCs). 
</p>


<h2><span id="Status"></span>Status</h2>
<p>Only the <i>Raspberry Pi 3 Family</i> is supported upstream, with the AArch64 effort.
</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 4B is not <em>supported</em> by NixOS, though a beta-quality disk image specific for it is produced. It will be supported the same as the Pi 3 family once the mainline kernel and mainline U-Boot boot fine through the generic mainline image.
</p><p>Other Raspberry Pis (0, 1, and 2) are part of diverse community porting efforts to ARMv6 and ARMv7.
</p><p>The Linux kernel in use, except for the Raspberry Pi 1 family, is the mainline Linux kernel, and not the Raspberry Pi Foundation's fork. This could reduce compatibility with some add-on boards or third-party libraries<sup>[expanded explanation needed]</sup>.
</p><p>The following table is intended to be updated by the NixOS contributors with the current status of the boards. For a list of products, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/">see the <i>Products Archive</i></a>.

<h2><span id="Notes_about_the_boot_process"></span>Notes about the boot process</h2>
<p>The custom bootloader, part of the Raspberry Pi firmware, is abstracted away for NixOS by making it boot U-Boot instead.
</p><p>U-Boot gives us the ability to provide a generation selection menu during the boot process, in addition to storing the boot files on the main partition, rather than on the firmware partition.
</p>
<h3><span id="Raspberry_Pi_.28all_versions.29"></span>Raspberry Pi (all versions)</h3>
<p>USB keyboards and HDMI displays should work, though some issues have been reported (see Troubleshooting below).
</p><p>Using the 3.3v serial port via the pin headers (exact location depends on hardware version) will get u-boot output and, when configured, a Linux kernel console.
</p>
<h2><span id="Troubleshooting"></span>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3><span id="Power_issues"></span>Power issues</h3>
<p>Especially with the newer power-hungry Raspberry Pi families (3, 4), it is important to have a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md">sufficient enough power supply</a> or <i>weirdness</i> may happen. Weirdness may include:
</p>
<ul><li> Lightning bolt on HDMI output "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> Screen switching back to u-boot text
<ul><li> Fixable temporarily when power is sufficient by switching VT (alt+F2 / alt+F1)</li></ul></li>
<li> Random hangs</li></ul>
<p>This problem is a hard problem. It is caused by the Raspberry Pi warning about power issues, but the current drivers (as of 
Linux 4.14) have a hard time dealing with it properly. If the power supply is rated properly AND the cable is not incurring too much power losses, it may be required to disable the lightning bolt indicator so the display driver isn't messed up.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The lightning bolt indicator can be disabled by adding the line <code>avoid_warnings=1</code> in config.txt<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p><strong> Note: </strong>A <i>properly rated</i> USB power supply, AND a good cable are necessary. The cable has to be short enough to not incur power losses through the length. Do note that thin and cheap cables usually have thinner copper wires, which in turn accentuates power losses.</p>

<p>NEW YORK CITY, December 20, 2019 -- As I walked home after work, I decided to
start a blog.</p>
<p>I had no plans for the evening, so I sat down to think. I picked a bench
overlooking the Hudson River, across from Jersey City. I took out my notepad
and started to sketch out my thoughts:</p>
<p>I had tried and failed at this before. I think I failed because I didn't have a
clear goal. And I didn't share much of that writing with other people, so I
had received little feedback.</p>
<p>I sat for a while. The sun set and the wind chilled my fingers, so I put my
notepad away and stuffed my hands into my pockets. I wanted to stay there until
I figured out my goal.</p>
<p>I decided that, for the next year, I would publish weekly articles about Python.</p>
<p>NEW YORK CITY, December 25, 2020 -- 52 articles later, I succeeded: I finished
the blog!</p>
<p>I learned that even if my writing isn't "perfect", it's still valuable.  I
overcame my perfectionism by sticking to the schedule: one article a week. But,
during the writing process, I also procrastinated, stayed up late, and had to
omit material that I couldn't complete in time.</p>
<p>Before my next project begins, I'm taking a short break. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my blog.</p>
<p>In particular, Arielle Domantay, Stefan Lance, and Oscar Martinez provided
frequent, valuable feedback. Here are their favorite articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arielle: "Building a command line tool to modify The Legend of Zelda's color
palette."</li>
<li>Stefan: "Solving the Cabbage-Goat-Wolf problem using Python."</li>
<li>Oscar: "Solving the Stable Matching problem in Python."</li>

<h3> Understanding Calculus </h3>
<p>
Understanding Calculus is a complete online introductory book that focuses on 
concepts. Integrated throughout the e-book are many engineering 
applications aimed at developing the student's scientific approach towards problem 
solving. 


</p><p> The book has as much to do with calculus as with philosophy. My
motivation in writing it was to prove to myself that I could understand
a complex subject like calculus by applying simple rules
of logic and reason. As Henry Ford said, " Nothing is particularly 
hard if you divide it
into small jobs ".  Too much of the world is
complicated by layers of evolution. If you understand how each layer is
put down then you can begin to understand the complex systems that
govern our world. 


Charles Darwin wrote in 1859 in his 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species" target="new">
On The Origin of Species</a>,

</p><blockquote>
<i>

" When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a
ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard
every production of nature as one which had a history; when we
contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of
many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same as
when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing of the
labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous
workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting,
I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become! "</i>
</blockquote>

<p> Darwin's words are equally applicable to art as well as science.
Every artist's performance requires a great deal of craft. Even
stand-up comedy is not a question of going on stage and saying funny things.
There is an enormous amount of work, practice and thought that would
have to go into it. 	


</p><p> My advice to students is to find something that
fascinates you. As Physics Nobel Laureate 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="new">
Richard Feynman</a>
 said, " Study hard
what interests you the most in the most undisciplined and
original manner possible." The price for seeking understanding is that one must be
willing to tolerate ambiguities and accept one's own ignorance. Feynman
said, " I can live with doubt and uncertainty. I think it is much more
interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be
wrong."

</p><p>


I hope you find the book enlightening as the goal is to learn by
understanding, not by memorizing.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Variables we declare in javascript with the help of <code>const</code>, are not purely constant. Let’s say that if we have a variable called config with a bunch of properties and if we print it to the console you will see it has a name and a database object.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>module-account</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>database</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>127.0.0.1</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>port</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>2020</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>admin</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>r@@t</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>);</span>    <span>// {"name":"module-account","database":{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":"2020","username":"admin","password":"r@@t"}}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But if we update the value of let’s say <code>name</code> to be <code>xyz</code>, you will see you can do that. Although it’s a constant.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>xyz</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>);</span>   <span>// xyz </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To prevent this javascript comes with a bunch of methods, such as <code>Object.freeze</code>, <code>Object.seal</code> and <code>Object.preventExtensions</code>. Which we can use to make them immutable. Let’s look at the examples to understand how they work and how we can use them in our codebase.</p>

<h2 id="objectfreeze">Object.freeze</h2>

<p>If we freeze an object, let’s say <code>Object.freeze(config)</code> and print the <code>name</code> you will see that we are still able to read the value from the config.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>freeze</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>);</span>       <span>// xyz</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But if we try to update any of the existing values, let’s say <code>config.name</code> is <code>abc</code>, we will get the error that we cannot assign the value to a read-only property.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>abc</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>    <span>// error </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, if we try to delete a property, let’s say delete <code>config.name</code>, we will not be able to do that, and also if we try to add a new property, let’s say <code>config.timeout</code> is <code>3</code>, we will still get the error because the object is not extensible.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>delete</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>     <span>// error</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>     <span>// error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only thing we can do is reading the properties from the existing object. One important thing to remember about the freeze is that it works only at the top level. So now, in this case, we have a database object, which is nested inside the config object.</p>

<p>If we try to update the value for, let’s say <code>config.database.host</code> is <code>10.10.10.20</code> and if we print the config, you will see that the database host has been updated.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>.</span><span>host</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>10.10.10.20</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>.</span><span>host</span><span>);</span>      <span>// 10.10.10.20</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want the object to be fully frozen, with all the objects inside, we have to recursively freeze all the objects. So in this case now if we want the database to be frozen also, we will have to do</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>freeze</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now we’ll get the error while updating the <code>host</code> that the database host cannot be updated because <code>config.database</code> is frozen</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>.</span><span>host</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>10.10.10.20</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>     <span>// error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="objectseal">Object.seal</h2>

<p>Next, we have <code>Object.seal</code> which is similar to <code>Object.freeze</code> in a way that you cannot add or remove properties from an object but you can update the values of the existing properties. Let’s say that we seal our config object so <code>Object.seal(config)</code>.</p>

<p>And now, if we do <code>config.name</code> to be <code>XYZ</code>, you will see that the <code>name</code> has been updated.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>XYZ</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But if we try to delete the property from the config object. Let’s say delete <code>config.database</code>, we will not be able to do that because, with seal, you cannot delete the properties from the object. And also, if we try to add a new property, let’s say <code>config.timeout</code> is <code>3</code> we will get the error, that you cannot add a new property to the object.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>delete</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>;</span>     <span>// error</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>     <span>// error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similar to <code>object.freeze</code>, <code>object.seal</code> also works on the top-level only. So, the seal will not be applied to the database object here and if we try to delete a property from the database object, let’s say delete <code>config.database.host</code>, we will see that the database host has been deleted from here.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>delete</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>.</span><span>host</span><span>;</span>        <span>// success</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, if we want to prevent this also, we will have to seal the nested objects.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>seal</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now we will get the error that we cannot delete a property from a sealed object.</p>

<h2 id="objectpreventextensions">Object.preventExtensions</h2>

<p>The last one we have is the <code>Object.preventExtensions</code>, which allows us to update the values and delete the properties from an existing object but it does not allow us to add new properties to the object.</p>

<p>So now, if we call <code>Object.preventExtensions</code> on our <code>config</code> object, and try to update the value for one of the properties, let’s say <code>name</code>, you will see that the name has been updated, and also if we try to delete one of the properties, let’s say delete <code>config.database</code>, we can also delete the properties but if we try to extend our object or let’s say add new properties, for example, <code>config.timeout</code> is <code>3</code> we can’t do that because our object is not extensible.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>XYZ</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>        <span>// success</span>
<span>delete</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span><span>;</span>     <span>// success</span>

<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>         <span>// error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One more thing to know about the <code>preventExtensions</code> is that if you delete a property from an object, you cannot add the same property back again and the reason for that is because adding a new property is considered extension. So if I do <code>config.database</code> again with something, it will give me the error that you cannot add a new property to the object.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>database</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>10.20.20.10</span><span>"</span><span>};</span>        <span>// error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar to <code>freeze</code> and <code>seal</code>, <code>preventExtensions</code> also applies only to the top-level properties.</p>

<p>There are three more methods that can be used to check if the objects are <code>frozen</code>, <code>sealed</code>, or <code>extensible</code>.</p>

<h2 id="helper-methods">Helper Methods</h2>
<p>So <code>Object.freeze</code> is to freeze the objects and <code>Object.isFrozen</code> can be used to check if the object is frozen or not.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>user1</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>firstName</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>John</span><span>"</span><span>};</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user2</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>firstName</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Doe</span><span>"</span><span>};</span>

<span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>freeze</span><span>(</span><span>user1</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>isFrozen</span><span>(</span><span>user1</span><span>));</span>        <span>// true</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>isFrozen</span><span>(</span><span>user2</span><span>));</span>        <span>// false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Object.seal</code> is to seal and <code>Object.isSealed</code> is to check if the object is sealed or not. And for the <code>Object.preventExtensions</code>, we have <code>Object.isExtensible</code> which can be used to check if the new properties can be added to the object or not.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We can conclude this topic using a CRUD table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>CREATE</th>
      <th>READ</th>
      <th>UPDATE</th>
      <th>DELETE</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Object.freeze</code></td>
      <td>✗</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>✗</td>
      <td>✗</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Object.seal</code></td>
      <td>✗</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>✗</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Object.preventExtensions</code></td>
      <td>✗</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>✓</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And that wraps it up for this article. Feel free to leave your feedback or questions in the comments section.</p>

<p>
I've always enjoyed terse programs that show how things work
<i>without</i> magic hiding incidental complexity. After realizing that my
initial attempt at a neural net only cost <span>less than 200 lines of Rust</span>,
I decided to take a snapshot and write about building it before I go
on and extend (and possibly over-complicate or abandon) the system.
</p>

<p>
More than anything else, treat this as encouragement to write your own
neural network – the core implementation turned out to be
surprisingly compact – enough to encourage me to write about it.
</p>

<p>
<b>This is not an introduction to neural nets</b>: There are several excellent
resources already available online that can describe the underlying
math and structure of networks; I'll just talk through them enough to
explain the structure of the code.
</p>

<p>
It's also entirely likely that I have mistakes in here; this was
written quickly with the main <b>aim</b> of encouraging more people to write
their own nets from scratch – and given one simple point for
comparison. If you do write your own, please share it with me!
</p>

<h2 id="orgd2852bf">Choosing a simple problem &amp; architecture</h2>
<div id="text-orgd2852bf">
<p>
Achieving SotA on MNIST is an explicit non-goal: this project is aimed
at exploring the mechanics of a neural network, and being able to play
around with it while changing one feature at a time.
</p>

<p>
Instead of trying to see if the network can accurately predict results
from data I can't understand or reason about, I'm going to have the
network try to behave like a simple continuous function of my choice
instead – I'll play with different functions like \(y=x^2\), \(y=x^3\),
\(y=x * sin(x)\), etc.
</p>

<p>
This greatly simplifies some parts of the network – there's a single
input, and single output. The <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html">Universality Theorem</a> suggests that I
should be able to get fairly far with a single layer, so that's where
I'm starting.
</p>

<p>
I like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning">ReLU</a> and leaky ReLU because of their simplicity, and I'll stick
with them here – though I don't have any strong justification about
the choice of activation function yet.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcfce027">
<h3 id="orgcfce027">Storing a network</h3>
<div id="text-orgcfce027">
<p>
The very first decision was figuring out how to store the neural
network – my very first attempt at doing this involved a lot of pure
functions and state being passed around all over the place which
quickly became messy – it was much more maintainable to have a single
place to represent a neural network.
</p>



<p>
Happily enough, with the decision to have a single input and output, a
single hidden layer means that there are only so many weights I need
to store. 
</p>

<p>
The overall structure is fairly simple:
</p>
<pre>
    o
  /   \
x - o  - y
  .   .
   . .
    o 

</pre>

<p>
Before drawing in the calculations that need to happen, I'm going to
introduce a system for indexing nodes which should make this much
easier to talk about and parse:
</p>
<pre>
          Layer -&gt;
   +-------------------------&gt;
   |    
N  |               0       1
e  |               |       |
u  |          0 -  o       .
r  |       /         \     .
o  | 0 - x -  1 -  o - 0 - y
n  |       .         .
|  |        .       .
v  |         ns -  o
   v               

</pre>

<p>
It's a fairly simple system for drawing neurons – a layer index that
starts at the first hidden layer; and a per-layer index into the
neuron itself.
</p>

<p>
For each <b>weight</b> in the system, there are going to be 3 coordinates:
the neuron it's at, and then the <i>input</i> it's specified for – this is a
little bit different than most online courses, because I'm <i>not</i>
directly using vectors to be very explicit about the underlying
calculations (both avoiding matrix calculations and paying the price
in terms of speed as the price).
</p>

<p>
Drawing in the calculations for evaluating the network forward to make
this a little bit more concrete:
</p>

<pre>         0    1
         |    |                   layer input   
                                    |     |
     0 - o &lt;------- n[0,0] = relu(w[0, 0, 0]x + b[0, 0, 0])
  /        \                           |
x -  1 - o -  y                      neuron   
  .        .   \
   .      .     relu(sum(w[1, x, i]*n[0, i] + b[1, x, i]))
    ns - o

</pre>

<p>
I also have somewhat stronger constraints on the potential values for
my indexes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>for layer = 0
<ul>
<li>the neuron's index can go from 0 -&gt; <code>ns</code> (number of neurons)</li>
<li>the input can only be 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>for layer = 1
<ul>
<li>the neuron's index can only be 0 (just one output)</li>
<li>and the input can go from 0 -&gt; ns (# of neurons in previous layer)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
In the code, I often refer to the <code>[layer, neuron, input]</code> index as <code>[x,
y, z]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Having this written out explicitly helped me a lot in implementing the
network, and I hope the constraints should make sense to you given the
structure of the network.
</p>

<p>
Finally, instead of dealing with initializing and taking care of
multi-dimensional vectors or arrays, I'm going to use a trick I often
rely on in Advent of Code for complex grid structures and keep a
single vector – with a function to translate my custom indexing
system into offsets.

<h3 id="orgf6e246d">Initializing the network</h3>
<div id="text-orgf6e246d">
<p>
Starting the network with all weights initialized to 0 is a good way
to get stuck with 0 gradients during gradient descent: and a good
experiment to run while running the code yourself.
</p>

<p>
For this first iteration, I'm hard coding random initialization of
weights into the program – but I'll expose another function that
accepts custom initial weights in the next iteration for exploration.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>+</span><span> use rand::thread_rng;</span>
<span>+</span><span> use rand::{distributions::Standard, Rng};</span>

  impl Net {

      pub fn new(ns: usize) -&gt; Net {
          let size = ns * 2;
<span>-</span><span>         let ws: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![0; size]; // This will change</span>
<span>+</span><span>         let ws: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = thread_rng().sample_iter(Standard).take(size).collect();</span>
<span>-</span><span>         let bs: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![0; size]; </span>
<span>+</span><span>         let bs: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = thread_rng().sample_iter(Standard).take(size).collect();</span>

          Net { ws, bs, ns }
      }

  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And a corresponding dependency in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:
</p>
<pre>[dependencies]
rand = "0.7.3"
</pre>

<p>
I admit being disappointed about having to use an external crate that
<i>does</i> have some magic, but RNGs are another black box to open and play
with for another day.

<div id="outline-container-org2965953">
<h3 id="org2965953">Evaluating a single point</h3>
<div id="text-org2965953">
<p>
Up next is evaluating the value predicted by the network at a single
point, which is a straight forward traversal through the network. I'm
going to use a leaky ReLU as my activation function, so I'll quickly
define it:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>relu</span>(<span>v</span>: <span>f64</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
    <span>if</span> v &gt;= 0.0 {
        v
    } <span>else</span> {
        0.01 * v
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
First, I'm going to throw in several utility functions to access or
calculate values in different parts of the net – in my first
implementation, I extracted these out after implementing back-prop,
but there's no harm in putting them up here first.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Net</span> {

    <span>/// Relu(w * input + b) for coordinates x, y, z with input val</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>rwxb</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        relu(<span>self</span>.wxb(val, x, y, z))
    }

    <span>/// w * input + b for coordinates x, y, z with input val</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>wxb</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>self</span>.w(x, y, z) * val + <span>self</span>.b(x, y, z)
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>w</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>self</span>.ws[<span>self</span>.pt(x, y, z)]
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>b</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>x</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>y</span>: <span>usize</span>, <span>z</span>: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>self</span>.bs[<span>self</span>.pt(x, y, z)]
    }

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Iterating through the net and calculating values lends itself
comfortably to Rust's beautiful iterator/expression based system:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Net</span> {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>eval</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        relu(
            (0..<span>self</span>.ns)
                .map(|i| <span>self</span>.rwxb(<span>self</span>.rwxb(val, 0, i, 0), 1, 0, i))
                .sum(),
        )
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you look at the diagram, I need to calculate the values of the
individual neurons – \(Relu(w * x + b)\) – which can be expressed as
<code>rwxb(x, 0, i, 0)</code> with <code>x</code> as the input and <code>i</code> ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>ns</code>
(number of neurons).
</p>

<p>
Then, the value of y is the value of these neurons as inputs added up,
and passed through Relu <i>again</i>. Which  is exactly what the function
above does.
</p>

<p>
(I admit to messing up the naming convention a little bit with x
playing double duty as both the input and the first coordinate; I'll
try to clean this up later if I find anyone actually reading this post.)
</p>

<h3 id="org016c8dc">Expenses</h3>

<p>
Keeping loss as simple as possible, I'm simply calculating it as \((y -
y')^2\) at a data point. The <i>cost</i>, or loss across a given set of data
is then the average of the total loss. The implementation is as
straightforward as you would expect, given data in the form of tuples.
</p>

<p>
This is yet another decision to play around with in the future with
alternative functions.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Net</span> {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>cost</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>data</span>: &amp;[(<span>f64</span>, <span>f64</span>)]) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>loss</span> = 0.0;
        <span>for</span> (x, y) <span>in</span> data {
            <span>let</span> <span>val</span> = <span>self</span>.eval(*x);
            loss += (y - val).powi(2);
        }
        loss / <span>self</span>.ns <span>as</span> <span>f64</span>
    }
}

Training involves calculating the cost for a given set of inputs,
determining the gradients of the cost for that set of inputs in terms
of all the weights and biases.
</p>

<p>
And then updating the weights and biases with the given learning rate
– which involves even more decisions and hyperparameters.

    Curated collection of data structures for the JavaScript language.
  </strong></p></div>

<hr>

<p>Mnemonist is a collection of data structures implemented in JavaScript.</p>

<p>It gathers classic data structures (think <a href="https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/heap">heap</a>, <a href="https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/trie">trie</a> etc.) as well as more exotic ones such as <a href="https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/bk-tree">Burkhard-Keller trees</a> etc.</p>

<p>It strives at being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As performant as possible for a high-level language.</li>
  <li>Completely modular (don’t need to import the whole library just to use a simple heap).</li>
  <li>Simple &amp; straightforward to use and consistent with JavaScript standard objects’ API.</li>
  <li>Completely typed and comfortably usable with Typescript.</li>
</ul>

   Aha, you say, Jean-Luc has matter-antimatter warp engines, Santa only has
reindeer, where does he get the power to move that fast! <p>
   You calculated the answer!  The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3
quintillion joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  This is an ample supply of
energy for the maneuvering, acceleration, etc, that would be required of the
loaded sleigh.  The reindeer don't evaporate or incinerate because of this
energy, they accelerate.  What do you think they have antlers for, fighting over
females?  Think of antlers as furry solar array panels.

<p>As we’ve been doing lately, last weekend we observed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> orbiter at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Telescope_Array">Allen Telescope Array</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> community activities in the telescope. This post contains a large overview of these observations, including the efforts to determine the spacecraft orbit, the study of the signal polarization, and the data obtained by decoding the telemetry.</p>



<p>I am still transferring the IQ data from the telescope, but I will publish the recordings in <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> in a few days and update this post.</p>



<h4>Orbit</h4>



<p>On December 16, the orbiter did an Earth fly by, avoiding reentry and dropping the capsule containing the lunar samples. The fate of the orbiter was unknown at that time, but there were words that it had plenty of spare fuel and an extended mission was being planned.</p>



<p>Amateur observers such as <a href="https://twitter.com/df2mz">Edgar Kaiser DF2MZ</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a> were able to <a href="https://twitter.com/df2mz/status/1339490142206234624">detect</a> the orbiter’s <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1339603055164067843">telemetry signals</a> on December 17, confirming that the spacecraft was still in space. However, its new orbit wasn’t know. Scott, <a href="https://twitter.com/Astrogator_Mike">Mike Loucks</a> and <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/">Bill Gray</a> set to try to determine the orbit.</p>



<p>The initial data <a href="https://twitter.com/Astrogator_Mike/status/1339857762482671617">suggested</a> an elliptical orbit with apogee at the Moon’s orbit, so that in three revolutions a Moon flyby could be performed to send the orbiter somewhere else. Observations with the ATA are of large help for this, because the 6.1 metre dishes have a rather narrow beamwidth at 8.4 GHz, so dish pointing data from ATA tends to be accurate to within 0.2 degrees, which is much better than what can be achieved with the smaller dishes of Amateur stations.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the narrow beamwidth of ATA makes it more difficult to find the signal, since even a small error in pointing will make it disappear completely in the noise. On Saturday 19 I used the pointing data from Edgar as a starting point for my search and managed to locate the spacecraft after some 45 minutes of manual search.</p>



<p>On Sunday 20 I wasn’t so lucky. I used the orbit that Bill had estimated as my initial search location, and after searching for a while manually, I decided to automate the search by slowly sweeping a small area of the sky to produce a signal intensity map. I started at the point predicted by Bill’s orbit and continued outwards, sweeping an ever increasing circular patch of the sky.</p>



<p>The resulting map can be seen below. Each of the squares in the image corresponds to 0.2 x 0.2 degrees and takes several seconds to generate, including 3 seconds of integration and the time that it takes to command and move the dish. In fact, this image took one hour and 15 minutes to generate.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find.png"><img width="590" height="567" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find.png 590w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find-300x288.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"></a></figure>



<p>We can already see the signal leaking in at the upper left border of the scanned circle, so at that point I decided to stop this search and start a new one centred at that point with the objective of fine tuning the signal location.</p>



<p>The resulting image is below. Here we clearly locate the spacecraft’s signal to one particular point of the sky. Note the change in the colour map range between this image and the previous one.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2.png"><img width="597" height="561" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2.png 597w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_find2-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></a></figure>



<p>As it turns out, the real position of the spacecraft was more than one degree away from my initial search location (which was taken from Bill’s orbit). The reason for this is that our initial ideas for the orbit were wrong. After including this new pointing data in his orbit solution, Bill noticed that the orbit’s apogee was much larger than we thought. In fact, the spacecraft was already on a direct path to the Sun-Earth L1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point">Lagrange point</a>. An official statement of this fact <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4584346742690791?">appeared in the news</a> more or less at the same time we realized this.</p>



<p>Still, our orbit estimate is far from perfect and has to be refined using further pointing and Doppler data. One of the main questions is whether the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_(astronomy)">elongation</a> and inclination is correct for a direct route to L1 or whether it will just go nearby L1.</p>



<p>The figure below shows a simulation in <a href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/docs/">GMAT</a> using some preliminary orbit data. We see that the spacecraft lags 45 degrees behind the L1 point until April 2021, when it starts being ejected slowly. It may happen that this is already good enough to wait until the appropriate moment to hop to a near-Earth asteroid, which seems the most likely science target, or that small corrections can keep the spacecraft hovering around L1 for longer or nudge it closer to it.</p>

<p>The orbit data used in the image above was taken from <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/temp/ch5.htm">Bill’s pseudo-MPEC</a> from Dec 20 21:46:31 UT, which gives the following state vector in GMAT.</p>

<h4>Polarization and signal strength</h4>



<p>Both on Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 the spacecraft signals were recorded during the full pass, until the spacecraft was lost below the 16.8 degree minimum elevation for tracking. On the 20th a lot of time was lost searching for the signal, so the recording starts some two hours late.</p>



<p>As usual, the signal at 8471.2 MHz was strong. The second orbiter signal at 8486.2 MHz was also present, but it was much weaker, so telemetry could only be decoded from 8471.2 MHz. However, an initial study of the Doppler from these two signals shows that the 8486.2 MHz signal drifts much less. This is probably caused by the two transmitters being in different locations, with the 8486.2 MHz transmitter at a more thermally stable position, perhaps shaded from the Sun. Thus, even if weaker, the 8486.2 MHz signal can give us more accurate Doppler data.</p>



<p>The figures below show the waterfall for the 8471.2 MHz and 8486.2 MHz signals for December 19. We can see a large increase in the noise floor around 17:00 UTC. I’m not sure of the cause of this, but I suspect ground noise entering through some of the dish sidelobes. We see that the signal is not in ground lock, since the idle telecommand signal being looped back at +/- 8 kHz from the main carrier is missing. The data sidebands are clearly visible in the 8471.2 MHz signal and almost in the noise in the 8486.2 MHz.</p>

<p>The waterfalls for December 20 are very similar. There is no noise hump, but the recording starts after 17:00 UTC. The sky track was quite similar on both days, so if the noise increase happens at a particular azimuth and elevation, then we would have missed it because of the late start on the 20th.</p>

<p>The signal strength (Stokes \(I\)) is shown in the plots below. The wiggles are an artefact caused by how the measurement is made (scalloping loss in the FFT). The measurement is signal plus noise of the main carrier, rather than just signal, so the measurement of the weak carrier 8486.2 MHz is not accurate.</p>



<p>The small jumps in the traces correspond to the moments when I tried to move the pointing slightly to improve the signal. Any variations seen here should not be taken too seriously, since they can be caused by a the pointing not being very good, rather than a real change in signal strength.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_power.png"><img width="644" height="347" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_power-644x347.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_power-644x347.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_power-300x161.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_power.png 719w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The polarized fraction (Stokes \(P/I = \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2 + V^2}/I\)) shows the degradation caused when unpolarized noise is included in the measurement for the weaker SNRs. For the weak 8486.2 MHz carrier we see that, in the measurement bandwidth, 50% or more of the power is unpolarized noise. Therefore, to normalize the Stokes \(L = Q + iU\) and \(V\) I have decided to divide by \(P\) rather than \(I\) as I was doing in <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/12/change-5-reception-from-ata-on-its-return-trajectory-polarization/" data-type="post" data-id="9400">previous polarization studies of Chang’e 5</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_fraction.png"><img width="644" height="344" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_fraction-644x344.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_fraction-644x344.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_fraction-300x160.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_20_fraction.png 724w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The plots below show Stokes \(V/P\), which indicates the circular polarization fraction and handedness. As in the previous weekend we see that the signal at 8471.2 MHz has almost ideal RHCP. This makes sense, because this should be the antenna that is pointing directly to Earth. The signal from 8486.2 MHz is seen with elliptic polarization, since it is probably pointing in a different direction.</p>



<p>On the 20th we see a decrease in the Stokes \(V\) of the 8471.2 MHz signal. This, together with the decrease in signal strength may be caused by a dish pointing error, but it could indicate that the spacecraft’s antenna is slowly moving away from Earth. In fact, since the Chinese are probably not going to monitor the spacecraft so often during the long trip to L1 (as evidenced by the lack of a ground lock seen in these observations), it is not so important that one of the antennas is kept pointing to Earth.</p>

<p>The two figures below show the relative strength and angle of the linear polarization on December 19th. Something weird happens with the polarization angle of the 8471.2 MHz signal around 17:00 UTC, but otherwise both signals show a slow increase in the angle throughout the observation. Note that this data is not corrected for parallactic angle rotation.</p>

<p>On December 20th we see a similar slow increase in the polarization angle throughout the observation. We also see a noticeable increase in the fractional linear polarization of the 8471.2 MHz signal, which matches the decrease in Stokes \(V\) we saw above.</p>

<p>The Jupyter notebooks used to produce these plots can be found <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_notebooks/blob/main/CE5/Polarization%202020-12-19.ipynb">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_notebooks/blob/main/CE5/Polarization%202020-12-20.ipynb">here</a>.</p>



<h4>Telemetry</h4>



<p>The telemetry decoded from the 8471.2 MHz signal contains, as usual, CCSDS AOS frames using virtual channel 1 for real time telemetry. I have analysed it in a <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis%20ATA%202020-12-19.ipynb">Jupyter notebook for 2020-12-19</a> and <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis%20ATA%202020-12-20.ipynb">another one for 2020-12-20</a>.</p>



<p>The decoded frames and frame loss for Saturday 19 are shown below. The decoding is quite good, except for a short interval around 17:00 UTC when the noise level rose higher and the signal became a bit weaker.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss.png"><img width="606" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss.png 606w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ce5_19_loss-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"></a></figure>



<p>The frames decoded on Sunday 20 do not have any gaps, but during the last hour of the observation we have some frame loss, since the signal was a bit weaker.</p>

</figure><h3><strong>Dead Alien Civilization </strong></h3><p>The researchers behind this study, Xiang Cai, Jonathan H. Jiang, Kristen A. Fahy, and Yuk L. Yung, explained in the paper that "if intelligent life is likely to destroy themselves, it is not surprising that there is little or no intelligent life elsewhere".</p><p>If people are wondering why humans, the most intelligent living being on planet Earth and on the solar system, might still be alive, it is because the species are billions of years behind these now-extinct alien civilizations. The intelligent species or aliens probably noticed life form around eight billion years after the formation of the Milky Way, whereas humans did not reach until 13.5 billion years after the creation. This means the humans are almost over five billion years behind.</p><p>According to Jiang, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory astrophysicist, since Carl Sagan's time, there has been lots of research on alien life, especially when the Hubble Space Telescope and Kepler Space Telescope were created. "We have lots of knowledge about the densities in the Milky Way galaxy and star formation rates and exoplanet formation...and the occurrence rate of supernova explosions. We actually know some of the numbers," he <a href="https://www.livescience.com/milky-way-alien-life-map.html" rel="nofollow">added</a>.</p>

</figure><p>The numbers are actually related to the mystery variables that the American astronomer and the planetary scientist Segan referred to in his Cosmos miniseries in which he discussed the Drake equation. This formula proposed by American astrophysicist Frank Drake estimates N, the number of transmitting societies in the Milky Way galaxy. It is actually the equation that may give the scientists an idea about how many alien societies exist and are detectable.</p><p>Because of the scientific limitations at that time, Drake and Sagan included variables that could not be identified more precisely. But now Jiang and the team of scientists have learned about some of those numbers which Drake and Segan failed to identify. The paper says when and where life is most likely to flourish in the Milky Way and it identifies the most important factor affecting its prevalence that is intelligent creatures' tendency toward self-annihilation.</p><p>Understanding the factors helped the team of scientists believe that advanced alien civilizations did exist at one point in the galaxy, but they likely destroyed themselves by way of progress. However, according to some scientific theories, there might be <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/there-might-be-36-alien-races-in-the-milky-way" rel="nofollow">36</a> extraterrestrial races among the stars.</p><p>Earlier in 2018, scientists claimed that the galaxy used to be the home to aliens but it was the effect of climate change that vanished all the life forms, as per a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/12/31/galaxy-may-be-littered-with-dead-aliens-blindsided-by-natural-climate-change/?sh=497bde101955" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> from Forbes. In the recently released paper, the researchers said, "The simulated age distributions also suggest that most of the intelligent life in our galaxy are young, thus making observation or detection difficult."</p><p>They also found that even if the galaxy reached its civilizational peak over five billion years ago, most of the civilizations that were around that time have likely self-annihilated. However, the paper has been submitted to a journal for publication and it is currently awaiting peer review.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The following is a post which I found on the Blind app. It covers all the preparation and experiences of someone who received multiple job offers from the best tech companies, including multiple offers in the range of $550,000/year.</p>



<p>Because it can only be accessed via the app, I have copied it in its entirety here, so others can benefit from it. In order to respect the anonymity of the poster, I have not included their name. If you are the poster and wish to be credited, please contact me and I’ll update this article.</p>



<hr>



<p>I learnt a lot about interviews from blind community. This is my effort to give back to the community. This thread is not about TC, but for the curious ones, I have multiple offers around 550k and I still negotiating, I will start another thread with comp details.</p>



<p>Offers I got – Facebook (E6), Uber (5b), Oracle (IC5), Google (L5), Lyft (L5), Pinterest (L5), Cruise (Sr SDE 2), Compass (Staff), Convoy (Staff)</p>



<p>Where I failed – Airbnb (Onsite), Netflix (Phone screen), Dropbox (PS)</p>



<p>I am SDE3 in Amazon and YoE: 11 and TC: 355k.</p>



<p>My interview preparation –</p>



<h2>Algo and Coding</h2>



<p>I started with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CodeSignal (opens in a new tab)" href="https://codesignal.com/" target="_blank">CodeSignal</a>. This helped me to kick start the coding prep. After solving 2-3 problems on each topic, I moved onto Leetcode. On Leetcode, I started solving “Top interview questions”, after solving 50+ questions, I started mock interviews on <a href="http://interviewing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Interviewing.io (opens in a new tab)">Interviewing.io</a>, I failed the first 2 but I learned from my failures. I succeeded in the next 2 interviews and started attending onsite interviews of companies that I don’t mind failing. As of now, I completed 120 questions on Leetcode, Easy/Medium/Hard ratio is 30/75/15.</p>



<p>For Staff and higher level interviews, System design and Behavioral/experience interviews play very important role. Hiring panel assesses your level based your interview perf in these interviews.</p>



<h2>System design</h2>



<p>I reviewed all the designs in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Grokking the System Design Interview (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.educative.io/" target="_blank">Grokking the System Design Interview</a> and watched most of the system design videos in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this YouTube playlist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUQe4BKZXs&amp;list=PLkQkbY7JNJuBoTemzQfjym0sqbOHt5fnV" target="_blank">this YouTube playlist</a> and read this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Primer on System Design (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer" target="_blank">Primer on System Design</a>.</p>



<p>In Amazon I used various AWS applications like Dynamo, S3, SQS, SWF etc and I also watched design videos of these services. That also helped me in doing well in these interviews.</p>



<p>My approach for system design interview – </p>



<p>3-5 mins: Clarify requirements and define functional and non-functional (scaling and perf) requirements</p>



<p>5-10 mins: Define APIs including input and output params. Discuss about data model (primary key, 2ndary key etc)</p>



<p>10-15 mins: Define higher level architecture. Talk about various components in the overall architecture, Web client, Load balancer, Application servers, Data bases etc. Take couple of APIs and talk about end to end data flow from user to the storage. Talk about performance issues and how caching can help (sometimes caching is a bad thing). </p>



<p>15-20 mins: Talk about critical use case(s) that is specific to the given problem. For twitter it is about fanning out updates and handling celebrity update issue, for messaging apps it will be maintaining device connection status and taking care of offline use case and read/unread status etc.</p>



<p>If there is more time, discuss about scaling bottlenecks and discuss about how to address those issues. Talk about failures and how do you handle failures (retries, exponential back off etc)</p>



<h2>Behavioral and experience interviews</h2>



<p>In behavioral interviews, interviewers expect you to answer following, be prepare with convincing examples from your past experience.</p>



<p>* Tell me about a recent project which was very challenging, explain the challenge and tell me how you went about solving it?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a project where you had to work with cross functional teams and had difficulty in managing the expectation from one of those teams? How did you handle such scenario?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a scenario where you had a conflict with senior/junior in your team, how did you resolve this?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a scenario where you couldn’t meet your commitments on a project, what was the situation and impact? how did you handle the situation?</p>



<p>* Tell me about a scenario where you discovered an issue in your design in the middle of the project and how do you went about resolving it?</p>



<p>* What is your process of project prioritization? What do you do, if in the middle of the project requirement changes?</p>



<h2>Some tips</h2>



<p>* I was very nervous before my first onsite as I appeared for an interview after long time. It went well. That game me lot of confidence.</p>



<p>* Treat the interviewer as a peer and have an open discussion in design interviews. When an interviewer enters the interview room, greet them with a smile. Interviews can be very nervous, a smile can calm both of you.</p>



<p>* When one of the interviews doesn’t go as expected in your onsite, you have to quickly forget it and move on positively to the next interview. If you do well in 4 out of 5 interviews, they might still offer you the position.</p>

December 25, 2020 | http://blog.pkh.me/p/28-building-a-competitive-ladder-for-openra.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.pkh.me/p/28-building-a-competitive-ladder-for-openra.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>3 years ago, mainly for nostalgic reasons, I started playing
<a href="https://www.openra.net/">OpenRA</a>, a free and open-source re-implementation of
the engine of C&amp;C real-time strategy games (Red Alert, Dune 2000, Tiberian
Dawn, ...). OpenRA supports online multiplayer game, but the mod I came for
(Dune 2000) wasn't very much played online, so I instead joined the most
popular mod crew, <em>Red Alert</em>.  Quickly enough, I got schooled by veterans,
went into competitive plays, and ended up participating in the <strong>Red Alert
Global League</strong> (RAGL, the biggest seasonal tournament) with... mixed results.</p>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/openra-kav-vs-happy-behind-the-curtain.png"></p>
<p>But this blog post is not about my pathetic pro gamer career.</p>
<p>While there are highly skilled players in the community and probably enough
players, training has always been a source of struggle and frustration for me,
and the main reason for that is the lack of a ranking system for players. This
means each game is a flip coin with regards to your opponent level, making hard
to evaluate our own level, and thus progression. That's why I decided to give a
try at building a competitive ladder.</p>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/ladder.png"></p>
<h2>Initial attempt</h2>
<p>Game server instances are independent: anyone can setup one, which will be
advertised on the master server so that any player can see it, join, and wait
in the lobby for one or more player before starting a game.</p>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/lobby.png"></p>
<p>With that in mind, I innocently thought that I could intercept the game results
from the server side (typically parsing the logs, maybe with some adjustments),
build a database of the outcomes, and setup a dumb web frontend on top.  "A
small week-end of work" I said to myself. How naive I was...</p>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/swordscomic-dot-com-qwest.png"></p>
<p>It was no surprise no one did it before. Thing is, while the server does see
who is playing against who, it doesn't actually know the outcome of the game
itself because it acts as a simple game packets router between players, with no
understanding of the game itself. A game server is actually relatively easy to
implement, and alternative implementations already exist.</p>
<p>A complex solution would involve emulating the whole game server side to figure
out the outcome. This was considered way too complex and very likely not
efficient at all.</p>
<p>Instead, the selected solution was to adjust the protocol and make the clients
transmit the current win/loss state to the server. A synchronization mechanism
based on hashing the game state was already in-place (used for bugs or
identifying malicious clients), which was extended to include a bit field
representing the wins/losses of the players at a point in time (team plays are
supported, up to 64 players).</p>
<h2>Refining the idea</h2>
<p>The initial draft to change the protocol didn't take long, and so I started
using that new information to make logs server side, and implement in parallel
the initial idea I had. Unfortunately, I had to wait for the <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/17578">PR</a> to
be merged so that all clients would actually start sending the missing
information. This single change being in a release was blocking everything
else. As soon as it was upstreamed, I could just run my own server
implementation with all the requirements for the backend and web-frontend.</p>
<p>It was basically starting to look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/architecture-logs.png"></p>
<p>The initial <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/17578">PR</a> implementing this was actually fairly simple, so I
thought it would not take long before it gets upstreamed.  Unfortunately for
me, instead of being merged, the PR started never-ending discussions about
server and protocol design, and revealed disagreements between the developers
on the following course of actions. For months, I was asked several times to
make changes in opposite directions...</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: it took 10 months for the PR to be merged.</p>
<h2>Recording replays</h2>
<p>With the PR going nowhere, I started going further in the implementation to
demonstrate the whole system. First of all, instead of providing logs, we could
actually record the whole game replays (a network recording of the whole game
that can be played back in the game client). That's typically done client side,
and they contain the game outcome.  With the server now obtaining the missing
bits of information, it opened the possibility to actually have these replays
recorded server side as well (game servers see all the traffic since they just
re-route it between players) with the proper header (actually a footer)
containing all the important game information.</p>
<p>With the replay recording feature, we could have the backend use them instead
of parsing the server logs. This has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>the replays being available server side means we can address and verify the
  games in case an incident is reported (cheating, various abuse, honest
  mistake, ...)</li>
<li>removing the file removes the entry automatically (no need to alter logs or
  database)</li>
<li>synchronization is all about files instead of merging log files or databases,
  so it opens up the possibility to have multiple server instances
  transparently</li>
<li>we don't have to define an intermediate format for transporting the
  information, the replay already exists for that</li>
<li>the replay contains all the information we can imagine using on the front-end
  (let's say if we want to expose the most played factions by a player, stats
  on the map played, average game duration of a player, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/architecture-simple.png"></p>
<h2>OpenRA accounts</h2>
<p>One of the greatest thing that happened to OpenRA recently was the <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/openrauseraccounts">OpenRA
account service</a>, which is basically a centralized
authentication system. This is actually an essential feature for a ladder and
I'm glad I didn't have to implement it. If the game has 2 authenticated
players, the backend can just query the OpenRA account service to get the
information on those players.</p>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/architecture.png"></p>
<p>The ladder will only accept games with authenticated players so that we can
actually trace players properly.</p>
<h2>Disconnect event</h2>
<p>The last issue to address was the player disconnection. If a player
disconnects, the game doesn't automatically associates it with a surrender
event, and thus the game state remains undefined. The reason behind this is
partly related to players expectations during multi player games (obscure story
about keeping dead player buildings present). I won't enter into the details
but it seemed to be kind of taboo to try to address the core issue.</p>
<p>The ladder needed an answer to that to prevent a losing player from
disconnecting to avoid registering a loss. The initial attempt at addressing
this was to basically demux (split into packets) the replays, look for
<code>Disconnect</code> events, and correlates them with the associated clients. This was
kind of painful and required a lot of complex logic in the backend.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we happened to find an agreement on how to simplify the handling
for the ladder: the disconnect frame index was simply added to the game summary
in the footer. That way, if the game state was undefined at the end of the
match, we were now able to derive it from the disconnect frame indices
(smallest disconnect frame identify the player who disconnected first). Not
ideal, but definitely an order of magnitude better than decoding the whole
replay.</p>
<h2>Technical summary</h2>
<p>The backend ended up being a small Python project, using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">TrueSkill™</a> algorithm for ranking, called to process replay files on
a regular basis using a cronjob. Similarly, I didn't try to make something
crazy complex for the web so I made a simple <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> project. After all,
this is just a dumb non interactive SQLite reader delivering for the web. I
started with the backend generating static pages, but this wouldn't actually
scale well with the increasing number of players and match details.</p>
<p>The whole thing has been released as Free Software (GPL3) on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ubitux/oraladder">OpenRA
ladder</a>. The complete setup is extensively described in the
<a href="https://github.com/ubitux/oraladder/blob/master/README.md">README</a> if you're interested in more details.</p>
<h2>Launch!</h2>
<p>7 months after the previous release (<code>20200503</code>), OpenRA finally released a new
playtest ("beta"): <code>20201213</code>. Ignoring the experimental devtests ("alpha"),
this was the first version to include the long awaited protocol change allowing
servers to be informed of the win/defeat state, finally unlocking the ability
to deploy the ladder.</p>
<p>A few weeks before the playtest, I paid for some hosting, bought the
<a href="http://oraladder.net/">oraladder.net</a> domain, and deployed the frontend as a demo using
the replays from the most recent and popular global tournament: RAGL Season 9.
Around the first devtests, the infrastructure was activated. A few iterations
on the devtests were necessary, and thanks to a few players and streamers, some
issues were uncovered (mostly in game) before the playtest.</p>
<p>The launch of the ladder received an overall unanimously positive reception and
I'm glad it's finally up and running. One thing I didn't expect though was how
much players were <strong>obsessed</strong> with the ranking algorithm itself. Days were
spent discussing and comparing the different algorithm, which would be best,
etc. I ended up adding a primitive ELO mode in the backend, and made sure
adding more would be trivial. TrueSkill™ being kind in a gray zone legally
speaking, we might need to switch to something else. Maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko</a>?</p>
<h2>Going further</h2>
<h3>Scaling</h3>
<p>Game servers are handled by different entities, so a trusted network need to be
setup to reduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>: basically, I need to add
different sources of replays from other server admins I can trust.</p>
<p>This could also mean replays from different mods, but that will require
adjustments on the backend and frontend. While both are mod agnostic, they
currently work for one mod at a time.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would hand the whole infrastructure to the OpenRA organization, but
the workload is probably too high for them currently. This may change in the
future if the ladder is really successful. If that's the case, it could also
simplify the communication between the ladder backend and the official OpenRA
user accounts service (which is admittedly clumsy today because I have to build
my own desynchronized subset of the account database by http queries on the
service).</p>
<h3>RAGL infrastructure</h3>
<p><img alt="centerimg" src="http://blog.pkh.me/img/oraladder/ragl.png"></p>
<p>Adjusting the ladder for independent tournaments (and in particular RAGL) is
currently a work in progress on top of my TODO list.  Organizers …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we will look at a rather old and somewhat quirky language that most of you probably don’t have on your radars.</p><p>While Erlang is not as popular as some modern programming languages, it quietly runs applications like WhatsApp and WeChat that serve massive amounts of users every day.</p><p>In this article, I will tell you more about this language, its history, and whether you should think about learning it yourself.</p><h2 id="what-is-erlang%2C-and-where-is-it-used%3F">What is Erlang, and where is it used?</h2><p>Erlang is a functional, general-purpose language oriented towards building scalable, concurrent systems with high availability guarantees.</p><p>It was built at the end of the 1980s at Ericsson for handling telephone switches. At the time, telephone switching systems were one of the most complicated systems out there, like the internet is nowadays. For this reason, the language used to program them needed to support high concurrency and zero downtime.</p><p>After going through multiple existing language options, three guys at the company – Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams – decided to create their own. This led to one of the coolest programming languages and, perhaps, the most awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXmOlCy0oBM">marketing video</a> for a language I’ve ever seen.</p><p><img src="http://serokell.io/files/qa/qap56dhf.1_(41)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang logo" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, what distinguishes this language from all of the others?</p><h3 id="process-oriented">Process-oriented</h3><p>The main thing that distinguishes Erlang from other languages is its process-based computing model. It uses isolated, lightweight processes that communicate with each other through messages.</p><p>These processes can receive messages and, in response to messages, create new processes, send messages to other processes, or modify their state. In other words, Erlang follows the <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">actor model</a>. If you’ve used Akka on JVM, you’ll feel right at home.</p><p><img src="http://serokell.io/files/nl/nlvg3wnn.2_(32)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang processes actors" loading="lazy"></p><p>The processes are isolated, fast to create, and take up only a small amount of memory. It is easy to expand your system by creating more of them. Since the processes don’t discern whether the other processes are on the same core or in another place, you can easily scale both horizontally (by adding more machines) and vertically (by adding cores).</p><h3 id="functional">Functional</h3><p>People usually group Erlang as a functional programming language with other languages like Scala and Haskell. Some of FP characteristics are:</p><ul>
<li>frequent use of pure functions</li>
<li>higher-order functions</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
</ul><p>More about functional programming you can find in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming">introduction to FP</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-erlang-good-for%3F">What is Erlang good for?</h3><p>Primarily, Erlang is a good choice whenever messaging between multiple agents across the network is involved, since that maps well on the basic structure of the language.</p><p>It is excellent for:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Chat apps.</strong> Messaging apps, including some famous examples like WeChat and WhatsApp, use Erlang to handle insane amounts of concurrent users. Erlang has a wonderful messaging platform called <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a> that can be used to create large-scale chat apps.</li>
<li><strong>Message queue systems</strong>. <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, an open-source message broker that implements AMQP and other protocols, is a huge success story for Erlang.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchains.</strong> <a href="https://aeternity.com/">Aeternity</a>, a blockchain for scalable, secure, and decentralized dapps, uses Erlang for its node implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Binary manipulation.</strong> Historically, Erlang has had to support rapid implementation of binary protocols for telecom purposes. Hence, it has features that make binary manipulation much more comfortable, such as pattern matching on binaries. You can, for example, use Erlang as <a href="https://doma.dev/#an-extra-bit-for-every-byte-ctf"><code>sed</code> for binaries</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Other distributed, high-performance services.</strong> If you need to process transactions coming from a ton of places in your fintech project or create a bidding/user matching platform, Erlang is not the worst choice either.</li>
</ul><p>You can check out some of the frequent use cases of Erlang in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">our list of Elixir and Erlang companies</a>.</p><h3 id="this-looks-complicated.-can-i-build-a-web-app-in-erlang%3F">This looks complicated. Can I build a web app in Erlang?</h3><p>Yes. Overall, Erlang is well-suited for creating fast and scalable web apps. If you get there, it is quite rewarding. There are some caveats, though.</p><p>At the core of your web app (and any other app that works with HTTP) will be <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy</a>, but further than that, you need to know what a web app consists of and pick your tools for each layer separately.</p><p>Libraries are well documented, but novice-level introductory material is relatively sparse, and you won’t find tutorials for everything. It’s not JavaScript.</p><p>All in all, if you do decide to build web apps, using <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#erlang-vs.-elixir">Elixir</a>, a language built on top of Erlang, might be a better choice.</p><h2 id="why-should-you-use-erlang-in-your-project%3F">Why should you use Erlang in your project?</h2><p>Erlang has three significant advantages over other programming languages, which mainly stem from the unique way the language is built.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Concurrency.</strong> BEAM, the Erlang virtual machine, uses lightweight threads of execution (called processes). These are isolated, run across all CPUs, and communicate through messages. Because of that and language’s functional nature, it is less hard to write concurrent programs in Erlang.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability.</strong> Erlang is perfectly suited to the distributed nature of modern computing and today’s multicore CPUs. Erlang processes allow us to easily scale systems, both by adding more machines and by adding more cores to existing machines.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability.</strong> Erlang has a motto – <a href="https://verraes.net/2014/12/erlang-let-it-crash/">“let it crash”</a>. Because of the unique approach to fault-tolerance, lightweight processes can be quickly restarted by the supervisor system, which helps you build self-healing systems. While this may not seem reliable, it deals with most bugs that are not due to severe implementation errors.</li>
</ul><h2 id="let-it-crash">Let it crash</h2><p>In this section, I’ll try to bring insight into how an Erlang app is structured and how the “let it crash” philosophy works out in real life.</p><p>In all actuality, letting it crash is not about crashing for the user or the system. That is something Erlang tries very hard to avoid. Rather, it is about containing failure when it inescapably happens, since in life, things do sometimes fail. Shit happens. Let’s see how Erlang cleans it up.</p><p>Basically, an Erlang app is a tree of processes.</p><p><img src="http://serokell.io/files/7z/7zr4ovpa.3_(30)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang app" loading="lazy"></p><p>At the bottom leaves of the tree, we have worker processes – the ones doing most of the work. Up from them, we have supervisors, which launch the workers and check up on them.</p><p>Supervisors themselves can be supervised; we can easily add a Grand Supervisor on top of the tree here.</p><p><img src="http://serokell.io/files/dt/dtuuj6hz.4_(24)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang supervision tree" loading="lazy"></p><p>In case a process crashes, it sends a message to its supervisor. Depending on the supervision strategy set, either just the process is restarted or all of the processes underneath its supervisor are.</p><p>If restarting the connected workers doesn’t solve the problem a given amount of times in a period, the supervisor will terminate all its children and then itself. At that point, the responsibility to try to handle the problem is pushed upwards to the next supervision layer.</p><p><img src="http://serokell.io/files/eo/eoil770p.5_(20)_(1).jpg" alt="handling failure" loading="lazy"></p><p>Only if the top-level supervisor fails does it not get restarted and the application crashes.</p><h2 id="erlang-vs.-elixir">Erlang vs. Elixir</h2><p>Erlang isn’t the only language that operates on BEAM; there are multiple others. The main one is Elixir.</p><h3 id="what-is-elixir%3F">What is Elixir?</h3><p><img src="http://serokell.io/files/ph/ph8n4xcr.erlang-elixir-what-the-hell-is-this-ruby-how-it-39889435.jpg" alt="Elixir Erlang meme" loading="lazy"></p><p>Elixir was created by José Valim in the early 2010s. He took Erlang and made a thin layer on top of it that had a more modern syntax that resembled Ruby.</p><p>The resulting language was an improvement over both Erlang and Ruby. It experienced a decent popularity surge in 2015-2016, when <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>, its main web framework, was released.</p><p>You can read more about Elixir and Phoenix in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-elixir">introduction to Elixir</a>.</p><h3 id="advantages-of-elixir-over-erlang">Advantages of Elixir over Erlang</h3><p>Elixir doesn’t actually add a lot of new features to Erlang. Everything you can do in Elixir, you can do in Erlang as well, and it is possible to call both languages from each other. Most of Elixir’s advantages stem from the fact that it has a more modern, Ruby-like syntax, which has led to it being more popular than Erlang.</p><p>Here are Elixir’s advantages over Erlang:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Modern syntax.</strong> The syntax of Elixir is much easier to understand if you’ve already programmed in virtually any other popular programming language. It removes some amount of boilerplate code and can lead to higher developer productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Higher popularity.</strong> Elixir has been the more popular of the two for quite some time, so content regarding Elixir is more up-to-date, and there is more of it out there.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> If you’re into web development, Phoenix is one of the best frameworks out there, and it is definitely the most convenient one if you want to do web development <em>and</em> functional programming. Talking about frameworks, Elixir also has Nerves – an awesome framework for embedded software. If this is the route you want to take, Elixir is a better choice.</li>
</ul><h2 id="is-erlang-worth-learning%3F">Is Erlang worth learning?</h2><p>So, why should you learn this language? There are three reasons:</p><ul>
<li>You’re eyeing a position in the specific fields that Erlang is used in. E.g. you adore chat apps and you would like to work at WhatsApp. That’s reasonable.</li>
<li>You want to write really small, portable programs with as little dependencies as possible. Erlang actually enables you to do a whole lot out of the box.</li>
<li>You’re a genuinely curious human being and want to discover new ways of programming without an immediate benefit to bottom line. In that case, I welcome you to the ranks of BEAM.</li>
</ul><p>If the last is true, I would actually point your way towards Elixir. While both languages are great to use, Elixir is the one that seems to be more popular lately. It will give you more job opportunities and will be easier to learn.</p><p>Afterward, you can learn Erlang and what makes it tick. Knowing how Erlang functions underneath Elixir will help you write better Elixir code and make you more likely to get hired as an Elixir developer.</p><p>Anyway, I don’t think you will regret any part of journeying BEAM, even though it is not all sunshine and rainbows (BEAM languages can get quite weird sometimes). If you are wondering where to start, I’d guide you either to <a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/">Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!</a> or our beginner’s guide on <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/learn-elixir">learning Elixir</a>.</p><p>If you would like to read more posts on BEAM languages, don’t be afraid to also follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/serokell">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://serokell.medium.com/">Medium</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Unit tests are unbelievably important to us as developers because they allow us to demonstrate the correctness of the code we’ve written. More importantly, unit tests allow us to make updates to our code base with the confidence that we haven’t broken anything. In our eagerness to get 100% code coverage, however, we often write tests for logic that perhaps we have no business testing. I’m here to assert that creating mock database abstractions in order to write unit tests is a bad idea<em> almost all of the time.</em></p>
<p>At <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we have a Postgres database running behind a RESTful Go API server, but we do our best to write small testable functions so that we don’t need to write useless mocks. That kind of code dirties the repository, adds unnecessary abstractions that make the code harder to understand, and doesn’t add any value to the robustness of the test suite.</p>

<blockquote><p>In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.</p><cite><a aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>In Go, unit tests can be executed using the <code>go test</code> command and some example source code looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func TestLogPow(t *testing.T) {
	expected := math.Round(math.Log2(math.Pow(7, 8)))
	actual := math.Round(logPow(7, 8, 2))
	if actual != expected {
		t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expected, actual)
	}

	expected = math.Round(math.Log2(math.Pow(10, 11)))
	actual = math.Round(logPow(10, 11, 2))
	if actual != expected {
		t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expected, actual)
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Where we are testing the <code>logPow</code> function that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">// logPow calculates log_base(x^y)
// without leaving logspace for each multiplication step
// this makes it take less space in memory
func logPow(expBase float64, pow int, logBase float64) float64 {
	// logb (MN) = logb M + logb N
	total := 0.0
	for i := 0; i &lt; pow; i++ {
		total += logX(logBase, expBase)
	}
	return total
}</code></pre>
<p>The goal of unit tests is to test a “unit”, or small portion, of code. If we can break our code into many small testable units, then we can automate much of our testing through these kinds of test suites.</p>
<h2>Good Code Is Easier To Test</h2>
<p><code>logPow</code> is a great example of the perfect candidate for a suite of unit tests. It’s a mathematical function with predictable outputs for any given inputs. Not all functions we write will be nearly this straightforward to test. However, if we can write small and ideally<a href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/purity-in-my-programming-please/"> pure functions where possible</a>, writing tests for them becomes much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Testing shouldn’t be hard.</strong> Simple code is easy to test.</p>
<h2>Unit Tests Shouldn’t Depend On Infrastructure</h2>
<p>In web development, it is commonly regarded as good practice (see <a href="https://reflectoring.io/book-review-clean-code/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clean Code</a>) to create architectural boundaries at every point of I/O. For example, your database functions with all their <code>SQL</code> and driver libraries should be separate from the code that ensures <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-password-validator" rel="noopener">your user’s passwords are secure.</a></p>
<p>Take a look at the following function:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func saveUser(db *sql.DB, user *User) error {
	if user.EmailAddress == "" {
		return errors.New("user requires an email")
	}
	if len(user.Password) &lt; 8 {
		return errors.New("user password requires at least 8 characters")
	}
	hashedPassword, err = hash(user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	_, err := db.Exec(`                                                                                                                          
		INSERT INTO usr (password, email_address, created)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
		VALUES ($1, $2, $3);`,
		hashedPassword, user.EmailAddress, time.Now(),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>
<p>There is no way to test this function without having a database connection available at the time of testing. If a new developer clones the project they will need to set up a database or else tests will fail. If you set up continuous integration testing pipelines they will also fail without a dummy database on the server. The point is, this is <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>Developers should be able to clone a repo and immediately run tests that pass.</p>
<p>The way to fix the code so that tests can be implemented would be to separate the testable logic. For example:</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func saveUser(db *sql.DB, user *User) error {
	err := validateUser(user)
	if err != nil{
		return err
	}
	user.Password, err = hash(user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := saveUserInDB(user); err != nil{
		return err
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>
<p>Now our primary function for saving users has been broken into three different functions:</p>
<ul><li>Validate the user</li><li>Hash the password</li><li>Save the user in the database</li></ul>
<p>We don’t need to write a test that tests this function as a whole, we can test the parts we care about independently. Assuming the <code>saveUserInDB</code> function is just making a SQL query, it probably doesn’t need a unit test at all. If the password hashing algorithm contains any more logic than a simple call to a well-tested crypto library then we can easily write a test for it, otherwise, we can trust the tests in the crypto library. The only test we probably need here is to test our own business logic, the <code>validateUser</code> function.</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func TestValidateUser(t *testing.T) {
	err := validateUser(&amp;User{})
	if err == nil {
		t.Error("expected an error")
	}

	err := validateUser(&amp;User{
		Email: "<a href="https://qvault.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6e1a0b1d1a2e1a0b1d1a400d0103">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>",
		Password: "thisIsALongEnoughPassword"
	})
	if err != nil {
		t.Error("should have passed")
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The point is, we need to break our large functions into smaller encapsulated units if we want to have an easy time of writing good tests.</p>
<h2>Don’t Mock Your External Dependencies Either</h2>
<p>While the last rule of thumb, “unit tests shouldn’t depend on infrastructure” is fairly uncontroversial, this next one is a more fiercely debated topic. I believe that the majority of database and API mocking is a result of bad code, and that to fix the problem, the best course of action is to refactor into smaller functions or “units” as we did a moment ago.</p>
<p>However, some engineers would rather lazily create a mock database interface and test the whole damn thing.</p>
<pre><code lang="go">type sqlDB interface {
	Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (sql.Result, error)
}

type mockDB struct {}

func (mdb *mockDB) Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (sql.Result, error) {
        return nil, nil
}

func saveUser(db sqlDB, user *User) error {
	if user.EmailAddress == "" {
		return errors.New("user requires an email")
	}
	if len(user.Password) &lt; 8 {
		return errors.New("user password requires at least 8 characters")
	}
	hashedPassword, err := hash(user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	_, err := db.Exec(`                                                                                                                          
		INSERT INTO usr (password, email_address, created)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
		VALUES ($1, $2, $3);`,
		hashedPassword, user.EmailAddress, time.Now(),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}</code></pre>
<p>With this code, we could now write a unit test that calls the entire <code>saveUser</code> function by passing in a <code>mockDB</code> so that we don’t depend on a running database for tests. As I hope is clear, there are several issues with this approach:</p>
<ul><li>The mock database code is unused in production. <em>We are testing code that literally doesn’t matter.</em></li><li>We technically have better “test coverage” with this approach, but our tests aren’t actually any more robust. We get a false sense of security.</li><li>We have made the <em>real</em> code harder to find by abstracting it behind an interface.</li><li>The fact that <code>saveUser</code> was hard to test was a great signal to us as developers that it needed refactoring. We’ve silenced a good signal that our code needs to be cleaned up.</li></ul>
<h2>Don’t Test Your Dependencies, Ensure They Pass Their Own Tests</h2>
<p>Building on the example of the refactored <code>saveUser</code> function before, we sill have two functions that are likely dependent on third party libraries, namely the <code>hash</code> function and the <code>saveUserToDB</code> function. If we’ve written our code well, those functions shouldn’t do much more than encapsulate a libraries API.</p>
<pre><code lang="go">func hash(password string) (string, error) {
	const cost = 10
	bytes, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), cost)
	return string(bytes), err
}</code></pre>
<p>There is no reason I can see to write a test for the <code>hash</code> function. Before importing the <code>bcrypt</code> library I should have done due diligence and made sure that the maintainers of that codebase have written good tests. Once I’m confident that they had done so, I don’t need to redundantly test all the exported functions.</p>

<p>How big is big data <i>really</i>? From time to time, various organizations brag about how much data they have, how big their clusters are, how many requests per second they serve, etc. Every time I come across these statistics, I make note of them. It's quite amazing to see how these numbers change over time... looking at the numbers from just a few years ago reminds you of this famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmXHvGZiSY">Austin Powers scene</a>. Here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">gem</a>.</p>

<h3>Twitter Infrastructure (January 2017)</h3>

<p>Overview of Twitter's current infrastructure:</p>

<img src="https://lintool.github.io/my-data-is-bigger-than-your-data/images/Twitter2017-infra-distribution.png">

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>

<li>Hadoop: We have multiple clusters storing over 500 PB divided in four groups (real time, processing, data warehouse and cold storage). Our biggest cluster is over 10k nodes. We run 150k applications and launch 130M containers per day.</li>

<li>Manhattan (the backend for Tweets, Direct Messages, Twitter accounts, and more): We run several clusters for different use cases such as large multi tenant, smaller for non common, read only, and read/write for heavy write/heavy read traffic patterns. The read/only cluster handles 10s of millions QPS whereas a read/write cluster handles millions of QPS. The highest performance cluster, our observability cluster, which ingests in every datacenter, handles over tens of million writes.</li>

<li>Graph: Our legacy Gizzard/MySQL based sharded cluster for storing our graphs. Flock, our social graph, can manage peaks over tens of million QPS, averaging our MySQL servers to 30k - 45k QPS.</li>

<li>Logging (Scribe, but transition over the Flume): We handle over a trillion messages per day and all of these are processed into over 500 categories, consolidated and then and selectively copied across all our clusters.</li>

<li>Caching: We operate hundreds of clusters with an aggregate packet rate of 320M packets/s, delivering over 120GB/s to our clients. We logically partition our caches by users, Tweets, timelines, etc. and in general, every cache cluster is tuned for a particular need. Based on the type of the cluster, they handle between 10M to 50M QPS, and run between hundreds to thousands of instances.</li>

<li>Haplo: Primary cache for Tweet timelines and is backed by a customized version of Redis (implementing the HybridList).

<h3>Internet Archive (October 2016)</h3>

<p>In October of 2012, we held just over 10 petabytes of unique content. Today, we have archived a little over 30 petabytes, and we add between 13 and 15 terabytes of content per day (web and television are the most voluminous).</p>

<p>Currently, Internet Archive hosts about 20,000 individual disk drives. Each of these are housed in specialized computers (we call them “datanodes”) that have 36 data drives (plus two operating systems drives) per machine. Datanodes are organized into racks of 10 machines (360 data drives), and interconnected via high-speed ethernet to form our storage cluster. Even though our content storage has tripled over the past four years, our count of disk drives has stayed about the same. This is because disk drive technology improvements. Datanodes that were once populated with 36 individual 2-terabyte (2T) drives are today filled with 8-terabyte (8T) drives, moving single node capacity from 72 terabytes (64.8T formatted) to 288 terabytes (259.2T formatted) in the same physical space! This evolution of disk density did not happen in a single step, so we have populations of 2T, 3T, 4T, and 8T drives in our storage clusters.</p>

			<p><span>S</span>ome <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/why-evolution-is-ageist" target="_blank">evolutionary biologists</a> say that after we pass reproductive age, nature, like a cat who’s been fed, is done with us. The bodily systems that thrived and repaired themselves to ensure that we pass on healthy genes cease to function well and leave us to slink to the finish line the best we can. Neuroscientist <a href="http://daniellevitin.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Levitin</a>, author of this year’s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598506/successful-aging-by-daniel-j-levitin/9781524744182/" target="_blank"><i>Successful Aging</i></a>, says “that’s not an unreasonable interpretation,” but he doesn’t settle for the view that aging after 40 is a long and listless mosey to the grave.</p><p>Levitin, 62, emeritus professor of psychology and neuroscience at McGill University, has lit up readers’ minds with his books on the joys of music, <i>This Is Your Brain on Music</i> and <i>The World in Six Songs</i>. But unlike an aging rocker playing his hits on an oldies tour, Levitin has remained fresh as a writer on the brain, exploring, in <i>The Organized Mind</i>, how to navigate our way through information overload to sane shores. In <i>Successful Aging</i> he details the effects of aging on this too solid flesh, from cell function to motor actions to sleep patterns, and prescribes ways of living to mute the insults of growing old.</p><p>Levitin nicely articulated his insights into better aging and living in our interview. After I transcribed our lively talk, I decided to step out of the picture and present his views on their own, under short subheads.</p> <figure data-alt="Berger_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18026_8031e8f282c78983bc47cc24ce5d90d3.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>a new tune:</strong> “Anything that pushes you out of your comfort zone and forces your brain to do things it hasn’t done before is good,” says Daniel Levitin, also a longtime backing musician and producer. This year he stepped into the spotlight himself and released an embracing album of his songs called <i>Turnaround</i>.</span><span>David Livingston</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>How We Age</b></p><p>We all age at different rates due to our history of exposure to environmental toxins and other stressors, both physical and psychological. That could include a history of a disease like diabetes, or whether you’ve been hit in the head repeatedly. We all know about people who are 50 and whose bodies are giving out, and people who are 90 and going strong. And the brain is a part of the body. Some people are able to enjoy long, sustained periods of cellular housekeeping and repair and others are not. To a neuroscientist, stress is a biological process. It’s not just road rage or being frustrated at work. Stress is a chemical response to things that happen to you and actually impairs the body’s ability to repair itself.</p><p><b>Why We Age</b></p><p>The question of why we age has produced a lot of false answers, such as, “We age because if we didn’t we would overpopulate the earth.” But evolution doesn’t know about overpopulation, so that doesn’t make sense. Or “We age so we don’t take for granted the time that we have.” But that’s nonsensical as well. These might be religious or philosophical notions, but they’re not scientific. We age because there’s been no evolutionary pressure to keep our bodies alive for a long time. I don’t know why that is and I don’t think anybody does.</p><blockquote><p>Successful aging is being able to continue to take pleasure from activities that have historically brought you pleasure.</p> </blockquote><p><b>When We Age</b><br></p><p>Aging begins with conception, fertilization, and cell division. You age in the womb, you age on the day you’re born, you continue to age. After reproductive age, it’s not that nature is done with us, although that’s not an unreasonable interpretation. But the whole idea of Darwinian theory, of descent with modification, random mutation, and natural selection, is that whatever shows up in your genome gets passed to the next generation. It influences the next generation and the generation after that and so on.</p><p>Suppose there were people who had this super genome that allowed them to live to be 100. Let’s take women because the reproductive cut off for women is pretty well defined. If a woman has some genetic modification or mutation that allows her to live to be a 100, that isn’t going to show up in the reproductive genome at age 40 necessarily. It will get passed on, but there’s no selection force. That is, no evolutionary mechanism that causes it to become more common in the population.</p><p>The traits that allow you to attract a mate have to do with your health and mental and physical stability at age 20, 30, and 40. If there’s something that could be happening to you at age 90, there’s no way for that to be selected by evolution because you are likely beyond reproductive age. There’s no evolutionary pressure for it. That’s been the hardline that Alison Gopnik and others have talked about with the “<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/what-good-is-grandma" target="_blank">grandparents syndrome</a>.” In Orca whales and humans, grandparents play a role in raising the grandkids, and so although a grandparent is only passing on a quarter of their genes, to a grandchild as opposed to half their genes to their own children. They are strengthening the viability of that child to go on and reproduce by nurturing it. In other words, the evolutionary pressure to pass on genes might be fulfilled in part by grandparents who have a gene for nurturing behavior that makes both their children and grandchildren more successful in life.</p><p><b>How We Die</b></p><p>At some point, unless we get hit by a bus, we’re all going to die of disease. Which is a way of saying that our ability to repair our bodies and cells won’t be able to keep up with the accumulated damage that life has brought to them. The system just doesn’t function as efficiently as we get older. And at some point it catches up to us and the body shuts down. I mean, nobody just dies, they die of something. A friend of mine’s mother just died. She had cancer and doctors gave her a few months to live. Then she got an <i>E. coli</i> infection because her immune system was compromised trying to fight the cancer. And so then they give her antibiotics. It got rid of the <i>E. coli</i> but then metabolizing the antibiotic was tough on her liver, and her liver wasn’t able to keep up with the cleansing procedures necessary to make it function well, and so she ended up dying about a week later of liver failure. The biggest risk factor for death is age.</p><div>

</div><p><b>Take Pleasure</b></p><p>Successful aging is being able to continue to take pleasure from activities that have historically brought you pleasure, and being able to find new things that provide pleasure. It’s being able to engage with life, with friends and relationships, and being able to make a contribution to the world—whether it’s the way the Dalai Lama and Jane Goodall are doing it, or just the world of your own family.</p><p><b>Be Upbeat</b></p><p>People who have an upbeat personality are more inclined to engage with other people. And other people are more inclined to want to engage with them. Nobody wants to be around a perpetual sourpuss. And social connections are vitally important to life satisfaction and successful aging, and in fact loneliness has been associated with a greatly increased risk of premature death. It compromises the immune system. Upbeat people tend to explore the environment more, which means they’re going to be more apt to learn new things and stay mentally challenged. They don’t get into despair. An optimistic person will more likely take steps to safeguard themselves because they think those steps are going to amount to something.</p><blockquote><p>People who have a personality that’s more generous have brains that are physically different.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Be Sociable</b><br></p><p>The neurochemical serotonin is responsible for mood regulation, and it’s also a precursor to immune system function. So if you’re in a good mood, and your serotonin levels are healthy, that’s going to produce T cells and natural killer cells, which are like the James Bond of the immune system. They handle the most difficult cases. Many of us have cancerous tumors growing in us all the time, but our immune system gets rid of them. We just don’t know about it. That’s how the immune system is supposed to work. When the immune system is compromised, or the cancer evolves some kind of special mutation that makes them resistant to our immune system, you can end up with a malignancy. But being upbeat, being sociable, being engaged with life tends to increase serotonin. And being stressed, which releases cortisol and adrenaline, for evolutionary reasons, turns your immune system off. It also turns off higher cognitive thought, digestion, and libido. In the short term, if you’re trying to escape from a tiger, it’s OK to shut down those systems. But you don’t want them chronically shut down.</p><p><b>Be Realistic</b></p><p>Be optimistic but realistic. You get a big ugly black growth on your arm and you think it couldn’t possibly be cancer and so you don’t have it checked. That’s too much optimism. False hope is tricky. If you’re convinced you’re going to die, and it sends you into a mental funk, depression and stress, that shuts down your immune system. If you’re optimistic and think you can fight this, you may be able to tilt the balance. Somebody could say, “I’ve got a 20 percent chance of living with this for another five years. Screw this, I’m just going to make out my will and sit on the couch and eat bonbons until I go.” But the other person would say, “20 percent? Maybe I can increase that to 30 if I do these things.” And that’s worth doing. You want to avoid the extremes of gullible optimism and fatalistic pessimism.</p><p><b>Be Prepared</b></p><p>We shouldn’t fear death. We need to prepare for it. If you’re afraid of a traffic accident, you still have to drive. You wear your seatbelt, you make sure the car is in good shape, the tires are inflated. Employ the same kind of conscientiousness you do before a long road trip to your own aging process. Follow healthy practices—a good diet, exercise, and good sleep hygiene. Make sure you have a doctor you trust, one you …</p></div></div>

			<p><span>T</span>he Chinese artist Xu Bing has long experimented to stunning effect with the limits of the written form. Last year I visited the Centre del Carme in Valencia, Spain, to see a retrospective of his work. One installation, <i>Book from the Sky</i>, featured scrolls of paper looping down from the ceiling and lying along the floor of a large room, printed Chinese characters emerging into view as I moved closer to the reams of paper. But this was no ordinary Chinese text: Xu Bing had taken the form, even constituent parts, of real characters, to create around 4,000 entirely false versions. The result was a text which <i>looked</i> readable but had no meaning at all. As Xu Bing himself has noted, his made-up characters “seem to upset intellectuals,” in a sly sendup of our respect for the written word.</p><blockquote><p>There was a long way to go from recording goods to writing great works of literature.</p> </blockquote><p>In another room was <i>Book from the Ground</i>, a slim volume, displayed in a room of Xu Bing’s inspiration: symbols and emojis, gathered from around the world and from different contexts, from an airport to a keyboard. Xu Bing scoured the world to find universal images and the result stands in stark contrast to <i>Book from the Sky</i>: This book was designed to be read by anyone. The first page was slightly awkward to read, translating the pictures to the (in my case, English) word. But as I turned the pages, the meaning emerged more fluently, and I was drawn into its story of a day in the life of an office worker. It was as if Xu Bing was asking me to wonder what was happening in my brain as these tiny pictures on the page transformed into meaning, a narrative. How was the process of reading pictorial symbols different from reading letters based on phonetic symbols?<br></p><p>Xu Bing was illustrating what recent studies in neuroscience have revealed: People everywhere read words made from pictures, such as Chinese characters (known as pictographs), and words made from letters, in a remarkably similar way. It’s an insight that opens a window on how writing developed and how we read—and how we might tap deeper wells of creativity and communication.</p><p><span>H</span>umans in different places and times have felt impelled to overcome the limitations of pictures in communicating. Despite the pressing need to capture spoken language in this form, some societies never felt the demand. Until colonialism, aboriginal communities in Australia lived in societies governed by extremely complex laws that passed through the generations entirely through oral means. For tens of thousands of years, rules governing hunting, finding your way, marriage, and ceremony have been embedded in song and performed, learned, and taught in everyday life. There’s beautiful sacred rock art throughout the continent, and symbols used for specific identification, but neither developed into a written system to capture a whole language.</p> <figure data-alt="Wilson_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18052_58f170c366f582dba770b94119f6099a.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BOOKKEEPING:</strong> This example of ancient cuneiform writing dates back to the Bronze Age. Irving Finkel of the British Museum says “a kind of administrative responsibility produced the first stumbling attempt at writing and then eventually a proper fluent script.”</span><span>Fedor Selivanov / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the earliest writing—symbols for meaning rather than pictures alone—is from Mesopotamia, dated to around 3000 B.C.; clay tablets dug up in the archaeological site of Kunara, near the Zagros mountains in modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan. These tablets record quantities of goods in a form of bookkeeping—incoming and outgoing amounts of flour and grains. “The thing about human ingenuity is that when there’s a sharp need for something, it tends to crystallize in discovery,” says Irving Finkel, an assistant keeper of ancient Mesopotamian script, languages, and cultures in the British Museum. Necessity being the mother of invention, in other words. “It’s very probable that it was [a] kind of administrative responsibility which produced the first stumbling attempt at writing and then eventually a proper fluent script,” Finkel says.</p><p>Egyptologist Gunther Dreyer came to similar conclusions during a lifetime of excavating Ancient Egypt, discovering artefacts crucial to our understanding of the development of writing. “Why is there a need to write something down? I think the reason for that is simple,” Dreyer says. “Those are the requirements of accounting.” Dreyer points out that ruling back then, as today, involved “collecting taxes and redistributing. And in a big area, you somehow needed to note down who delivered what when.” Indigenous Australians feeding themselves and their communities through a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, bartering goods with other communities, didn’t need to record such trade, either for a third party far away (such as a tax office) or for posterity.</p><blockquote><p>No writing system goes back much further than 5,000 years, a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.</p> </blockquote><p>But there was still a long way to go from recording goods and quantities to writing great works of literature. Humans all over the world faced the same problems in expressing themselves beyond the here-and-now that speech has covered. It turns out that every ancient writing system solved these problems in exactly the same way. “We like to call it the giant leap for mankind,” Finkel says. The leap is from using a picture as a picture (a logogram) to using it to portray a sound (or phonogram)—the Rebus Principle. Many children play a game using this principle, when they discover that a bee can be used for the sound “be,” and combined with a drawing of a leaf, these two unrelated objects can suddenly produce a meaning—belief.</p><p>But then ambiguity arises: When is a bee a bee, and when is it a sound? Cuneiform, Egyptian, and Mayan hieroglyphs and Chinese all solved the problem in the same way: They added unspoken elements now known as “classifiers” to clear up whether the writer is talking about keeping bees or simply using “be” as a sound. Chinese still uses this system, with picture, phonetic, and classifier elements all crucial to their written system. But in other places a different system took over: the alphabet, invented around 4,000 years ago in the Sinai Peninsula. Stripped of anything but sound, this handful of symbols can be learned quickly, unlike the thousands of Chinese characters that must be mastered for literacy. After a few centuries of remaining at the margins, the alphabet from the Sinai swept through Europe and much of Asia and Africa, changing into the dizzying range we have today.</p><p><span>N</span>o writing system goes back much further than 5,000 years, a mere blink of an eye in evolutionary terms. “Relative to speech [reading is] very young,” says Tae Twomey of University College London, who has spent her career looking into this new trick of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. “The part of the brain that deals with reading had to evolve somehow from the brain that we used before writing was invented.” And it wasn’t just one part that was recruited. “If you think about it, it’s a complex task. You are extracting visual information in order, ultimately, to get to a meaning.” Once I do start to think about this process—a process I can’t remember not being able to do—it starts to seem extremely alien: Thoughts, ideas, instructions, information are being transferred from one human brain into mine, via my optic nerve. But the visual element is only part of the story.</p><p>Twomey’s research uses scans to show the different areas of the brain that are active when we read. “It’s a distributed network,” she explains. Neurologist Thomas Hope, a senior research associate at University College London, offers an analogy. “Like most cognitive behavior, we think reading works like the Nile Delta.” It’s not fed by one stream, he says, “but a bunch of potentially redundant streams.”</p> <figure data-alt="Wilson_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18051_dd5f1fd8442d4ba6b35dd13c9db44343.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>WRITE ON:</strong> Writing arose at different places around the globe, diverging from pictographic to alphabetic symbols. But when we look deep inside the brain, it turns out people everywhere write and read in remarkably similar ways.</span><span>Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure> <p>For reading, there are two large tributaries, broadly correlated with sound and vision. (The third major area working on the task is the Broca’s area, in charge of executive function, which acts as the conductor, orchestrating all the inputs.) Beginning readers sound out each letter to get to the meaning. “Reading is not just to communicate meaning, but also to communicate generally,” Hope says. “And the most common way that we communicate is by speaking. So when you read a word, some part of your brain is sounding out what that word would sound like if you were saying it or if someone was saying it to you.” And that act of speech communication is the same across cultures, whatever the written form of the language, so most readers will be hearing as they read.<br></p><p>But sound isn’t all. “I’ve been watching my children learn to read,” Hope says. “You can’t learn to read just by learning the letters. You have to learn to understand and recognize the words, too.” Readers in an alphabetic system have to learn the equivalent of characters: Learning the shape of a word is basically the same job as extracting the meaning from a pictographic character. But once we get more fluent at reading we tend to use a different tributary more. “Another way, that most skilled readers prefer, is to recognize the whole word as a single entity and connect it directly to meaning,” Hope says.</p><p>The so-called “Cambridge letter,” a meme in 2003, gives a proficient reader a chance to test this latter mode of reading, through shape recognition rather than sounding out the letters:</p><p>Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.

			<p><span>I</span> remember my grandfather commenting—wry amusement tinged with grim resignation—that what made him finally feel old was seeing his children reach middle age. I was a child then. Now I see my own children, not quite middle aged, starting to have children of their own.</p> <p>Becoming a grandparent is quite lovely, an affirmation of continuity and a front-row-seat to watch (and even, on occasion, participate) as life itself is conveyed into the future. But aging is also our most undeniable <i>memento mori</i>, a reminder not so much of life as one’s own eventual death. My grandfather’s death frightened me as few things have since, except for the recurring recognition (usually at night, alone, in the dark) that his life, everyone’s life, even—astoundingly—my own, is short indeed.</p><blockquote><p>As Buddhists see it, all organisms are necessarily—even marvelously and gloriously—impermanent.</p> </blockquote>


 <p>All things, especially living ones, are marinating in the river of time. We see and understand that our bodies will wear out and we will die. At least that’s how it looks through the lens of Western science, where all things come to an end, winding down in a final surrender to entropy. But there’s another perspective, surprisingly in harmony with science, that helps us revisit that huge and ancient terror—fear of time itself—in a new and perhaps even reassuring way. And that is the perspective offered by Buddhism.</p> <p>For Buddhists, the “center cannot hold,” as the poet W.B. Yeats pointed out, because it doesn’t exist as something rigidly separate from everything else. Nothing is permanent and unchanging, ourselves included. Attempting to cling to a solid, immutable core of a self is a fool’s errand because time not only creates anarchy, it provides the unavoidable matrix within which everything—animate and inanimate, sentient and insensate—ebbs and flows.</p> <p>As Buddhists see it, all organisms are necessarily, unavoidably—even marvelously and gloriously—impermanent. In Sanskrit, the word for impermanence is <i>anitya</i>. To understand <i>anitya</i> is to achieve something remarkable: opening a door onto the accord between modern western science and ancient eastern wisdom.</p> <p>In his book, <i>Physics and Philosophy</i>, Werner Heisenberg—one of the commanding figures in the development of modern quantum physics—wrote that “in the history of human thinking the most fruitful developments frequently take place at those points where two different lines of thought meet.” Contrary to Rudyard Kipling’s injunction, “East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,” I have found, as a trained biologist, that some of the most fruitful developments in modern thinking occur precisely where the twain of biology and Buddhism meet.</p><div>

<p>Even inanimate objects that appear solid and persistent are revealed by modern physics to be in a constant state of flux. An iron bar is mostly empty space, and even the ostensibly solid, sub-atomic particles occupying that space are either moving so rapidly as to be unimaginable or, alternately, exist as clouds of probability rather than as stationary monuments to permanence.</p> <p>With living things, the world is even less fixed. As Yeats observed: “O body swayed to music, O brightening glance / How can we know the dancer from the dance?” Biologists as well as Buddhists know that living stuff is always dancing, constantly replenished by, and created from, nonliving components. At every moment, our existence takes place only on the instantaneous, knife-edge of Now, which can never be captured and held immobile.</p> <p>The story goes that as a young man, the Buddha sought to overcome the imperfections of the real world—sickness, old age, and death—by following the path of traditional Hindu asceticism, mortifying the flesh and nearly starving himself. His eventual enlightenment, however, is said to have involved recognition that all things are temporary, ever-changing, and impermanent. Unlike Christ, who promises eternal life, the last words of the Buddha reportedly began, “Decay is inherent in all things.”</p> <p>But even decay—an unavoidable consequence of time impacting the real world—isn’t something to regret. As the Vietnamese Buddhist monk and scholar, Thich Nhat Hanh, put it, impermanence (<i>anitya</i>) is intimately tied to continuity. “Look back,” he counsels, “and you will see that you not only exist in your father and mother, but you also exist in your grandparents and in your great grandparents.” Look again, and you will see we “have been gas, sunshine, water, fungi, and plants,” he writes. “Nothing can be born and also nothing can die.” To understand this, and to do so deep in our ever-changing bones, may forever change our sense of time and what it means to participate in life on earth.</p>  <p><span>A</span>ging is undoubtedly the most apparent and unavoidable manifestation of how <i>anitya</i> is both revealed by time and produced by it, how impermanence is manifest in every body. Precisely how bodies age is the domain of biological gerontology, which studies such events as the increased accumulation of somatic mutations, reductions in tissue elasticity, increase in autoimmune responses, and diminished length of telomeres (end-pieces of chromosomes that can be likened to the plastic tips at the end of shoelaces, and which evidently protect chromosomes as they undergo cell division). Most human cells poop out after about 60 or so replications, apparently in conjunction with the loss of telomeres, which become a bit shorter with every bout of mitosis—although it isn’t clear whether aging-related decrepitude results from this reduction in telomere length, or vice versa.</p> <p>Whatever the causative sequence, there is no fountain of youth. We can reduce the rate of decline by eating healthy foods, reducing stress, and exercising regularly. But the effect, at best, is to slow the process, never to stop it altogether. To be a museum conservator, exercise fanatic, or just a dedicated daily dental flosser is to be more Sisyphus than Ponce de León.</p> <p>But this is too pessimistic. A Buddhistically informed view suggests that even as everything changes over time, this very impermanence is connected to a deeper kind of persistence. One of the more striking visual demonstrations of this is the practice among Tibetan monks of constructing gorgeous sand mandalas, complex designs and patterns laboriously built over many days, after which they are ceremoniously swept away. Proxies for ourselves, mandalas symbolize the impermanence of everything, no matter how lovely, complex, treasured, or important.</p><figure data-alt="Barash_BREAKER_Mandala" data-title="Sands%20of%20Time" data-capper="Tibetan%20Buddhist%20monks%20create%20a%20mandala%20of%20colored%20sand%2C%20a%20symbol%20of%20impermanence." data-credits="DIBYANGSHU%20SARKAR/AFP/Getty%20Images"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/2217_b5c01503041b70d41d80e3dbe31bbd8c.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Sands of Time:</strong> Tibetan Buddhist monks create a mandala of colored sand, a symbol of impermanence.</span><span>DIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Some years ago, while waiting for a wilderness permit at a Forest Service ranger station in the small town of Sedro Woolley, Wash., I overheard a radio message sent in by a ranger: “Dead elk in Agnes Creek decomposing nicely. Over.” The ranger was ecologically sophisticated as well as Buddhistically accurate. Although a decomposing elk might not be everyone’s idea of “nice,” the process is as necessary to a healthy ecosystem as it is unavoidable. (The “over” was an especially nice touch.)</span><br></p> <p>For another good example of biological <i>anitya</i>, one that overturned prior biological dogma, consider Dolly, who famously emerged as the world’s first artificially cloned sheep. Before Dolly, it was widely held that once vertebrate cells had fully differentiated—becoming, say, muscle or skin or, in the case of Dolly’s “mother,” mammary gland tissue—they were permanently fixed and couldn’t become a different kind of cell.</p> <p>Dolly was created when an already differentiated nucleus was implanted into an enucleated egg cell, and a new animal emerged, complete with a full array of distinctly different cell types. Cell differentiation is evidently not a one-way street, as previously believed. One of the things built into life itself is, ironically, impermanence and the capacity to change.</p> <p>The reality of <i>anitya</i> extends to whole genomes, which are permeable to genes introduced from other lineages. This is why we can put cold-resistance genes from halibut into frost-vulnerable tomatoes. (Whether we should is another question.) Even without high-tech human intervention, the evolutionary reality of continuity among all living things is inseparable from the fact that all lineages have themselves evolved—that is, they have changed over time, and continue to do so. The seemingly rigid boundaries between cells and within species are flexible and inconstant. Living things do not simply have the capacity for impermanence; rather, at what we might oxymoronically call their “core,” they are profoundly and deeply impermanent and ever-changing.</p> <p>What about whole organisms taken in their entirety? After all, each halibut, hickory tree, or human being appears to be distinct and fixed in time—or at least identifiable as this object, this creature, this person. But each “this” is largely an artifact of our own limited perception of time and its impact. Wait long enough, give time the opportunity to work its way, and every living thing changes, undergoing embryogenesis, growth, senescence, and finally death. In short, time will tell.</p> <p>Question: When a Buddhist nun goes to a beauty parlor, what is she is likely to get? Answer: an impermanent.</p>  <p><span>I</span>t would seem, nonetheless, that living things struggle to defy <i>anitya</i>, to resist change. The technical term among physiologists is “homeostasis,” the process whereby organisms maintain their internal environment within limits. This is notably true of mammals, which possess various adaptations to keep their internal temperature independent of the outside environment. At least as important, however, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everyone has a story tell, whether you are an individual, a local group, or a business striving to define itself narrative helps put the events of our lives into context and gives meaning to the day in and day out. But putting that story into action and telling it in a way that is compelling and engaging can be quite overwhelming.</p>
<p>That is where <em>Narrative First</em> and the Dramatica theory of story come in. Whether you want to tell the story of your walkabout through Europe, your quest to climb the tallest mountain in California, your nights and weekends developing the skills of your daughter's soccer team, or your efforts to transform the culture of your business or organization you need to know and appreciate the various complexities of effective narrative. By using techniques proven time and time again to be successful towards the structuring of a great story, we can help frame your life's events into something truly captivating--and meaningful.</p>
<p>As mentioned several times here and elsewhere, life is meaningless until we put the events of our lives into context. <strong>Stories give meaning to our lives by putting everything in context.</strong> Fusing character, plot, theme, and genre into one cohesive "message" the mundane, chaotic, seemingly inconsequential moments of our lives become transformative.  </p>
<p>The following is a sneak-peak at the step-by-step approach we use when <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/mentorship">helping writers craft their story</a>, whether fiction or non-fiction. Feel free to start using it in developing your own projects, and we look forward to hearing your story soon.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-plot">The Basic Plot</h2>
<p>The first four story points concern the story itself. What were you after and how it all turned out. Where the pressure came from and how you felt about the experience. Laying the groundwork for the narrative up front helps set the stage and starts to give form to the formless. </p>
<h3 id="step-one-the-story-goal">Step One: The Story Goal</h3>
<p>The first and possibly the easiest step to take is to define the Goal of your story. The <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-goal" title="Story Goal - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Goal</a> helps set the context for what you will be looking at and gives a starting and ending point for the narrative. Did you want to learn everything you could about Eastern culture? Maybe you had a half-marathon you wanted to compete in. Maybe you wanted to win the half-marathon.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Or maybe you wanted to help your business embody Old World principles of respect and honor. Regardless the type of Goal, there was some endgame you had in mind--something you set out to accomplish. Write about that Goal.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-the-story-continuum">Step Two: The Story Continuum</h3>
<p>Now that you have set the context for your story, begin to take a look at the kind of story you want to tell. Every great story comes to an end because the characters run out of time, or run out of options. Both exist within the context of a story, but one will be seen as the lens to <em>appreciate</em> the other.</p>
<p>Since you are the character in this story, which one sounds most appropriate? Did you set out on a walkabout through five Eastern European countries?  If so, then your story elevates space over time; the countries take precedence over which one was first, or which one was second. Your story explores conflict in <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/dynamics/spacetime">Spacetime</a>. You likely felt as if time was running out when you hit that last country, but that is what it is like to be <em>in</em> your story.</p>
<p>With Dramatica and these Story Points, you want to step outside of yourself and your own experience and see story as this <em>thing</em>--this entity that you are sculpting. It can be difficult at times, especially since the fun part of writing is pretending you are the characters and living vicariously through them. The only problem with that approach is you will never be able to see the forest for the trees. You might find meaning, but <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/articles/the-veil-between-author-and-audience" title="The Veil Between Author And Audience - Narrative First">you will never be able to predict how your story should work</a> to give that meaning.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-continuum" title="Story Continuum - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Continuum</a> looks one way to the Author, but a completely different way to the characters within the story. As you are crafting a story, you need to be able to see outside of your own experience and see what <em>objective</em> elements set the narrative into motion. With the walkabout through Europe, it may have felt at the time as if you were running out of time, but putting that kind of time limit on a narrative would not grant the same feeling to your readers. A Continuum of Spacetime gives the characters, and by proxy the Audience, a feeling of time running out.</p>
<p>Perhaps your story took time to look at space. Maybe you were preparing for a marathon that took place 57 days from when you started. You probably pulled out a calendar and circled that date. Each morning you woke up, checked off a day, and set about training for the end. As that day rapidly approached, you probably felt panicked as if you were <em>running out of things you could do</em>--options you could take. Your story would explore conflict in <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/articles/series/dynamics/timespace">Timespace</a>.</p>
<p>Whether writing a story about the relative potentials of various options (Spacetime) or the temporal sequencing of linearity (Timespace), take some now to weave that Story Continuum into your paragraph about the Story Goal.</p>
<p>Each of these Story Points builds upon the last. The Goal sets a finish line, the Continuum sets the path towards that Goal. In fact, all of these Story Points work together to tell the holistic "message" of your story. In essence, you sculpt your story by adding to it, rather than shaving away the bits you don't need. With each of these steps, build upon the last to create a lasting and transformative narrative.</p>
<h3 id="step-three-the-story-outcome">Step Three: The Story Outcome</h3>
<p>This one is easy. Did you win or lose?</p>
<p>Did you land that account or climb that mountain? Did your sales team embody those principles of success or did they tear themselves apart? Did you fail to make the quarterfinals in that screenplay contest? Or did you find out that you can never truly know all there is to know about a culture?</p>
<p>Whatever the <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-outcome" title="Story Outcome - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Outcome</a>, write a new paragraph about what happened at the end of your story. Silly and simple, yes--but essential towards communicating the eventual message of your story. You set out to achieve the Story Goal. The Story Continuum defined the context and direction of those efforts. At the end, you either achieved success or you failed miserably.</p>
<p>And not personal success or personal failure. It is likely you set out to accomplish one thing, but learned something else was far more important. That is a great story and one many want to communicate. But the "far more important" angle is found in another Story Points, not this one. What you want to do with the Story Outcome is focus on whether or not the Goal was reached. How you felt about that outcome is the subject of our next Story Point.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-the-story-judgment">Step Four: The Story Judgment</h3>
<p>In a separate paragraph at the end, write about how you felt about your entire experience. Was it worth it visiting all those countries? Did you find relief after finishing the marathon? Or did you feel worse about even participating? Did you end up even more lost and confused at your workplace?</p>
<p>The Story Goal--the thing you originally set out for--is a cold and logical Story Point, devoid of emotion or any real passion. The same can be said of the Story Continuum and the Story Outcome. But here at the end, clueing us in on how you felt about the story gives us the Audience a reason to care. It helps us empathize with your plight and understand everything you went through.</p>
<p>Our minds crave emotional logic every bit as much as they chew on rational logic. A story needs both sides lest it risk having "holes" in the logic. Failing to give an Audience an emotional assessment of a narrative is akin to reading the stock section of the Wall Street Journal. Unless you tell us how you feel about Progress, we see only numbers.</p>
<p>As you can see with this last Story Point--the <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/story-judgment" title="Story Judgment - Appreciations - Subtext">Story Judgment</a>--we are starting to work our way towards the more personal side of things. We start with the rational side of things because it can often be easier, particularly if you are dealing with your own life's story. But Audiences want to know the intimate details. They want to know who you are, where you came from, and what issues you had to overcome.</p>
<h2 id="opening-up">Opening Up</h2>
<p>Having established a framework for your story and a context for the events, we now turn our attention towards you. This is often the most difficult part of turning anyone's life into a story because it can be hard to sit back and take an objective look at yourself. We need to identify the personal issues in your life as they are the key to giving your story emotional resonance.</p>
<p>Your readers or viewers want a reason to care. They want to know something intimate about you that they can somehow relate to their own life's struggle. If you stay closed off and refuse to open up and be honest about what you went through, the story itself will feel closed and muted. No one wants to sit through a story like that.</p>
<p>If these events just occurred, the emotional fallout may still be so overwhelming that you're not sure where to start or know exactly where it is you were coming from. The more time you have between the end of what happened and the time when you begin the story can make all the difference in understanding your own issues.</p>
<h2 id="the-characters">The Characters</h2>
<p>For a story to connect, an emotional attachment needs to be made between Author and Audience. Successful Authors do this by giving the central character of their story deep personal issues--issues that may be familiar or recognizable to an Audience. The more honest and true these issues are, the greater the connection.</p>
<h3 id="step-five-your-own-personal-baggage">Step Five: Your Own Personal Baggage</h3>
<p>In a separate paragraph at the beginning of your story, write about your own personal baggage and those issues you brought to this narrative. What made it more difficult for you to reach the Story Goal and what prevented you from seeing the endgame? In the middle of your story, write about how you worked through that baggage, and then at the end let us know what happened to it all.</p>
<p>In Dramatica, this personal baggage is known as the <a href="https://narrativefirst.com/appreciations/main-character-domain" title="Main Character Domain - Appreciations - Subtext">Main Character Throughline</a>. You are the Main …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Some of my friends have been telling me that Windows machines got a lot better. I decided to give it a try, and bought a top of the line Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 8. For all of you thinking about doing the same switch, you might want to read this first.</p>

<p>Even though Apple is known for overpricing, and taking advantage of their customer base, they do it in a larger scheme of things, and do not engage in business practices which have a low customer experience. Unfortunately, you can’t say the same about the Lenovo universe.</p>

<p>Just go to their <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/">website</a> for a minute. Try to figure out which Laptop to buy, without getting the feeling you are being scammed. Everything seems to be on sale all the time, there are laptops of different generations of the same product line being advertised to you. They lie to your face about the battery life-times. People who are buying these machines got used to this experience, and are proud of being able to navigate such websites. You really need to do your homework before buying anything.</p>

<p>For example: I bought the X1 with their standard FHD screen, and it feels older than my 7 years old MBP. When trying to figure out why, I found out that Lenovo has a “<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-s-Panel-Lottery-continues-with-3-different-14-inch-LowPower-displays.426538.0.html">panel lottery</a>”: They use different suppliers with remarkable quality differences for their displays. Which one you get is just based on luck. Turns out the panel I got is the same they use for their cheapest product line. This means I have a ghosting mouse pointer on a $2000 brand new machine. Nice.</p>

<p>Even if you are lucky with the screen: it does not come color calibrated out of the box! Good luck trying to find the correct color profile, unless you want to spend money on a calibration tool you’re only going to use once.
Then comes Windows:</p>

<p>Yeah, it got better, but wow, do they carry a lot of baggage around. When trying to calibrate the display I found out that Windows has no less than three different system configuration UIs, which are also intertwined in unexpected ways. On top of that Lenovo installed their own buggy configuration tool. Configuring Windows feels like walking on ice. Even with all this configuration might, it still was not possible to get the exact serial number of my display panel without installing a third party tool.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also constantly nagging you about something that marginally helps their bottom line, but costs you a lot of your user experience. Like their constant push to trick people into giving them their data, or the fact that they try to force you to use their browser whenever they can.</p>

<p>I’m still not sure if I ticked the right boxes so that Microsoft does not get my browsing behaviour. I feel stressed every time Microsoft wants something from me. How are they trying to scam me this time?</p>

<p>For me this reinforces my belief that people who like Windows are simply used to it, because they need it for work or playing games. There is no point arguing with this, as their added value is their own experience, and the fact they know the tools and tricks to make the system usable to them.</p>

<p>One friend even told me that one of his favourite improvements in newer Windows versions is that they made it a lot easier to completely reset the operation system. My Apple machine has never been reset since I bought it almost a decade ago, and works flawlessly.  His statement seems like a subtle warning as to what is expecting me in the near future using my new  machine.</p>

  <p>If this isn't your first time visiting my blog, you may recall that I've spent
the past several years building an <a href="http://cliffle.com/tags/glitch-demo/">elaborate microcontroller graphics
demo</a> using C++.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, I've been rewriting it — in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>
<p>This is an interesting test case for Rust, because we're very much in C/C++'s
home court here: the demo runs on the bare metal, without an operating system,
and is very sensitive to both CPU timing and memory usage.</p>
<p>The results so far? <strong>The Rust implementation is simpler, shorter (in lines of
code), faster, and smaller (in bytes of Flash)</strong> than my heavily-optimized C++
version — and because it's <strong>almost entirely safe code,</strong> several types of
bugs that I fought regularly, such as race conditions and dangling pointers, are
now caught <em>by the compiler.</em></p>
<p>It's fantastic. Read on for my notes on the process.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Rust tools and library ecosystem are fantastic. Simply having a package
manager is an incredibly important advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I am writing C++, I'm thinking about undefined behavior and bugs the
compiler won't catch. When I'm writing Rust, I'm thinking instead about how to
optimize things or add features. There is a very real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">cognitive load</a>
difference and it makes me more productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust's safety features, such as bounds checking, have caught bugs and have not
caused performance problems. (With one exception, discussed below; in that
case the fix was simple.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The port revealed <em>significant subtle bugs in the C++ code</em> when the Rust
compiler wouldn't let me do certain things...that turned out to be
legitimately incorrect things to do.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/cbiffle/m4vgalib/">m4vgalib</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/cbiffle/m4vgalib-demos/">attendant demos</a> as an exercise in
hard-real-time programming. I wanted to see how far I could push C++, so I
avoided assembly language everywhere except certain routines that weren't
possible without it.</p>
<p>Now, given my <a href="http://cliffle.com/blog/prefer-rust/">feelings about C++</a>, I want to see how far I can
push Rust — specifically, safe Rust. See, despite having written C++ as my
day job for many years, I'm aware that most of the common security/reliability
bugs we see in software today are a result of flaws in the C and C++ languages.
Rust fixes <em>essentially all of these flaws.</em> So I've been keeping an eye on it
for a while. More reliable software with less work? <em>Yes please.</em></p>
<p>My graphics demos are so resource-constrained, and so timing-sensitive, that
they fall squarely into the traditional domain of assembly and C — a
domain that has been well-defended for years. Can I build the same thing using a
memory-safe language? Could I use the additional brain-space that I'm <em>not</em>
spending on remembering C++'s initialization order rules (for example) to make a
better system with more features?</p>
<p>The answer so far seems to be yes.</p>

<p>This is a late addition to my notes, because I've gotten so used to it in
languages like Rust, Haskell, Python...even JavaScript...that I had forgotten
what a giant thing this is.</p>
<p>Programming languages fall into two categories: those that were designed before
the advent of modern package managers<sup><a href="#packman">1</a></sup>, and those designed after.
There's a very important difference between these two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pre-package-manager languages try to have an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink
standard library, and developers tend to avoid third-party libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post-package-manager languages go for a more minimal standard library, and
developers are accustomed to extending it with packages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, C falls in the first category, and Rust falls in the second.</p>

<p>Adding a new third-party dependency to a C project is, at best, a giant pain.
It might not support your build system, you're probably going to have to figure
out some include-path magic, and it's almost certainly not built with the same
linter settings. At worst, it might be using an incompatible subset of core
language features, like exceptions vs. not. C programmers (myself included) tend
to avoid such dependencies at all costs, <em>up to and including rewriting
everything themselves.</em> (<a href="https://github.com/cbiffle/etl/">Guilty.</a>) This is a huge drain on productivity
and creates new bugs each time.</p>
<p>For contrast: there came a moment when porting my Conway's Game of Life
implementation when I needed a random number generator, to seed the playing
field. Rust's standard library <em>doesn't contain a random number generator.</em>
Instead, I added a dependency on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rand/">the <code>rand</code> crate</a>, let it automatically
download and build, and continued programming.</p>
<p>I see the C++ community watching Rust and <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2018/09/20/lifetime-profile-v1-0-posted/">trying to adapt our best
features</a>, but imagine what a standardized C++ build system
and package manager would do for the language.</p>

<p>For bare-metal programming specifically, the <em>truly killer feature</em> of Rust is
the <code>no_std</code> ecosystem.</p>
<p>C++ has a monolithic standard library with an amazing set of cool stuff in it
(because, as I noted in the last section, of when it was written).  However, the
library embeds some important assumptions. In particular, it is written for a
"normal" C++ execution environment, which for our purposes means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a heap, and it's okay to allocate/free whenever.</li>
<li>Exceptions are turned on.</li>
</ol>
<p>In most high-reliability, hard-real-time embedded environments, neither of these
statements is true. We eschew heaps because of the potential for exhaustion and
fragmentation; we eschew exceptions because the performance of unwinding code is
unpredictable and vendor-dependent<sup><a href="#exceptions">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Now, there are <em>parts</em> of the C++ standard library that you can use safely in a
no-heap, no-exceptions environment. Header-only libraries like <code>type_traits</code> are
probably fine. Simple primitive types like <code>atomic</code> are ... probably fine?</p>
<p>I keep saying "probably" because the no-heap, no-exception subset of the C++
standard is <em>not clearly defined.</em> (The C++ standards folk have, in fact,
resisted doing this, arguing that it would fragment the language; this ship has
most definitely sailed.) As a result, it's really easy to <em>accidentally</em>
introduce a heap dependency, or to <em>accidentally</em> use an API that can't indicate
failure when exceptions are disabled (like <code>std::vector::push_back</code>).</p>
<p>The Rust standard library has a critical difference: it's divided into two
parts, <code>std</code> and <code>core</code>. <code>std</code> is like the C++ equivalent. <code>core</code>, on the other
hand, is how <code>std</code> itself is implemented, and <em>doesn't assume the existence of
things like "the heap," threads, and the like.</em> While code depends on <code>std</code> by
default, you can set an attribute, <code>no_std</code>, to request only <code>core</code>.</p>
<p>This is a tiny design decision with huge implications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By setting the <code>#[no_std]</code> attribute on a crate, you're opting out of the
default dependency on <code>std</code>. Any attempt to use a feature from <code>std</code> is now a
compile time error<sup><a href="#stderr">3</a></sup> — but you can still use <code>core</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can trust <em>other</em> crates to do the same, so you can use third-party
libraries safely if they, too, are <code>no_std</code>. Many crates are either <code>no_std</code>
by default, or can have it enabled at build time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>core</code> is small enough that porting it to a new platform is easy --
significantly easier, in fact, than porting <code>newlib</code>, the standard-bearer for
portable embedded C libraries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For <code>m4vgalib</code> I rewrote almost all my dependencies to get a system that
wouldn't throw or allocate. In Rust, I don't have to do that!</p>


<p>Rust's ownership rules produce a sort of bizarro-world of API design.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some (uncommon, but reasonable) API designs won't make it past the borrow
checker. (In nearly every case, these are APIs that were <em>easy to use
incorrectly</em> in other languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some API patterns that are grossly unsafe or unwise in other languages are
routine in Rust because of lifetime checking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of the latter: it is common, and safe, to loan out stack-allocated
data structures <em>to other threads</em> with no runtime checks. (See: <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.1/crossbeam/thread/">scoped threads
in crossbeam</a>.)</p>
<p>Another: it is normal in Rust text-processing code to deal in <code>&amp;str</code>, which is
equivalent to a C++ <code>string_view</code>. Storing a <code>string_view</code> in C++ (say, in the
heap) is an incredibly bad idea, because <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/issues/1038">it's easy for it to become a dangling
pointer</a>; C++ programs resort to defensive copying to avoid this.
On the other hand, Rust programs routinely store <code>&amp;str</code>, copying only when the
borrow checker can't prove that the code is correct.</p>
<p>When this is working well, it can cause abstractions and complexity to dissolve.</p>
<p>Concrete example: <code>m4vgalib</code> (C++) lets applications provide custom
<em>rasterizers</em> that are invoked to generate pixel data. They are subclasses of
the <code>Rasterizer</code> library class, which sports a single virtual member function
(called — wait for it — <code>rasterize</code>). You register a <code>Rasterizer</code>
with the driver by putting a pointer to it into a table. Once registered, the
<code>Rasterizer</code> will have its <code>rasterize</code> function called from an interrupt handler
once per scanline.</p>
<p>You, the application author, have some responsibilities to use this API safely:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>Rasterizer</code> object needs to hang around until you're done with it
— it might be <code>static</code> or it might be allocated from a
carefully-managed arena.  Otherwise, the ISR will try to use dangling
pointers, and that's bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the <code>Rasterizer</code> object is accessible by the ISR, it can be entered at
<em>basically any time</em> by code running at interrupt priority. Because we can't
disable interrupts without distorting the display, this means that your
application code that shares state with the <code>Rasterizer</code> (say, a drawing
loop) needs to be written carefully to avoid data races. Commonly, this means
double-buffering with a <code>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code> flip signal...and some
manually-inserted barriers...and some squinting and care to avoid accessing
other state incorrectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before disposing of the <code>Rasterizer</code> object, you must un-register it with the
driver. This prevents an ISR from dereferencing its dangling pointer, which,
again, would be bad.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I recreated the C++ API …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>H</span>oliday-season traditions stretching back for centuries have linked wintertime romance to decorative&nbsp;sprigs of mistletoe. The way that the plantâ€™s rounded evergreen leaves and white berries tightly hug the branches of the trees on which it grows probably inspired that association. The truth&nbsp;about this botanical intimacy is&nbsp;less romantic: Mistletoe is a kind of parasite. Its leaves produce sugars by photosynthesis, but instead of roots, it has structures that pierce the host treeâ€™s vital tissues to suck out nutrients and water.</p>

<p>But that interdependence goes even deeper, and scientists are just starting to realize the ways in which mistletoes are unique at the molecular level because of it. The cells of all multicellular organisms rely on the organelles called mitochondria to make their biochemical fuel—all multicellular organisms except mistletoes, that is. Not only do their mitochondria produce little if any of this fuel, theyâ€™ve lost many of the genes needed to make it. In the few years since botanists discovered this anomaly, scientists worldwide have tried with no more than limited success to figure out how mistletoes pull off this trick.</p>
<p><strong>Cellular Powerhouses Go Offline</strong></p>
<p>The first hint that mistletoes were truly&nbsp;<em>sui generis</em>&nbsp;was presented in 2015 at the International Conference for Plant Mitochondrial Biology in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland, by&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-zvgjbUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Elizabeth Skippington</a>, then a postdoctoral fellow in&nbsp;<a href="https://biology.indiana.edu/about/faculty/palmer-jeffrey.html" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palmer</a>â€™s lab at Indiana University. She astounded the small scientific audience with evidence later&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/27/E3515" target="_blank">published in&nbsp;</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1504491112" target="_blank"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>&nbsp;that one mistletoe species (<em>Viscum scurruloideum</em>) had an extremely tiny mitochondrial genome and lacked key proteins thought to be required for respiration — the chemical pathway that enables mitochondria to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cellsâ€™ molecular fuel.</p>
<p>â€œIt felt like everybody was holding their breath,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genetik.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/people/people/epv/section-v-plant-proteomics/graduate-teachingresearch-assistant/jennifer-senkler/?tx_t3luhepv_t3luhepvoe%5BdisablePersHomepages%5D=" target="_blank">Jennifer Senkler</a>, a plant biochemist with Leibniz University in Germany, who attended the talk. â€œIn the next break, everybody was chatting excitedly about this and speculating on how this could work.â€�</p>
<p>They wondered if perhaps Skippington missed the genes because they had become unrecognizable, or if there was some error in her methods. Or maybe the genes had moved into the nuclear genome—thatâ€™s something that can happen with mitochondrial genes, after all, and mistletoesâ€™ enormous&nbsp;genomes (about 24 times the size of ours) have thus far impeded whole-genome sequencing. Everyone was eager to solve the mystery of the missing genes.</p>
<p>â€œWe started joking about researchers falling off trees in the attempt to get their hands on mistletoe plants,â€� Senkler wrote in an email to&nbsp;<em>Quanta.</em>&nbsp;Indeed, as soon as she and her colleagues returned to Germany, â€œwe bought a long branch cutter and started collecting mistletoes.â€�<br></p>
<p>They werenâ€™t the only ones. Not far from Senklerâ€™s lab in Hannover, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam-Golm, the biochemist&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.urz.uni-halle.de/cellphysiology/more-about-etienne/" target="_blank">Etienne Meyer</a>&nbsp;started some investigating of his own. And at the John Innes Center in Norwich, England,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/janneke-balk/" target="_blank">Janneke Balk</a>&nbsp;similarly decided to dig into mistletoe mitochondria. Balkâ€™s team soon reached out to Meyerâ€™s, and the two labs joined forces, though they kept running their experiments in parallel for the most part to ensure the results were replicated. â€œThatâ€™s what makes the story even more solid,â€� Meyer said.<br></p>
<p>In the end, all three research teams came to&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.036" target="_blank">the same conclusion</a>: Mistletoe mitochondria donâ€™t perform the same ATP-generating process as the mitochondria of all other plants, fungi and animals. The genes Skippington spoke of are truly gone, not mutated or repositioned. And as yet, no one knows how mistletoes survive without them.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolic Misers</strong></p>
<p>In all other multicellular life studied to date—and in most single-celled eukaryotes, for that matter—mitochondria produce ATP in a five-step process. Each step is performed by a separate suite of proteins, complexes I-V. â€œAnd one of these, the very first complex, is totally missing in mistletoes,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/gipe0376-1.379971" target="_blank">Gitte Petersen</a>, a botanist at Stockholm University in Sweden.</p>
<p>Trained as a plant systematist, Petersen at first thought that maybe this loss of complex I might be common. But when she and her colleagues&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-019-1401-8" target="_blank">checked nine other parasitic plant groups</a>, the rest were normal. Something special seemingly happened in the mistletoes alone.</p>
<blockquote>â€œIn the next break, everybody was chatting excitedly about this and speculating on how this could work,â€� says&nbsp;Jennifer Senkler of&nbsp;Leibniz University.</blockquote>

<p>As for how mistletoes compensate for the loss of these incredibly important genes, â€œwe can only speculate,â€� Meyer said.</p>
<p>Experiments show that mistletoes make some ATP; itâ€™s just unclear whether their mitochondria play a large part in that. Meyer and Balkâ€™s collaboration found that the plants do produce more proteins&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.036" target="_blank">for use in glycolysis</a>, an inefficient method of splitting apart sugars to make ATP thatâ€™s found in all cells. However, the scientists couldnâ€™t determine exactly how much ATP the plants generate that way.</p>
<p>Still, ramping up glycolysis enough to rival mitochondriaâ€™s usual ATP output would take a lot more sugar. Meyerâ€™s hunch is that the mistletoes steal sugar from their host, along with&nbsp;water and minerals. They might even photosynthesize more feverishly than other plants to make extra sugars to burn, although Meyer labels that idea â€œextremely hypothetical.â€�</p>
<p>Mistletoes may&nbsp;also just use energy with Scrooge-like miserliness. Both Senkler and Petersen pointed out that a parasitic lifestyle and slow growth could&nbsp;enable mistletoes to subsist on low amounts of ATP. In fact, â€œmistletoe might teach us a lesson on how to survive at energy-limiting conditions,â€� Senkler said.</p>
<p><strong>Too Complex to Keep?</strong></p>
<p>However mistletoes get by with their deficient mitochondria, the big unanswered question is why these plants did away with something so seemingly useful.</p>
<blockquote>â€œ[M]istletoe might teach us a lesson on how to survive at energy-limiting conditions,â€� says&nbsp;Jennifer Senkler of&nbsp;Leibniz University.
</blockquote>
<p>Senklerâ€™s suspicion is that complex I was too burdensome to keep. It consists of about 50 proteins that have to be made in different subcompartments of the cell, assembled and fit into the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The energy cost of all that is considerable, even if it means more energy in the long run, and â€œmistletoes seem to avoid processes that require much energy,â€� she said.</p>
<p>Ditching energy-expensive traits, or â€œreductive evolution,â€� is a common theme in parasites, Meyer noted. And losing this particular suite of proteins might have additional benefits. Because complex I spews highly reactive molecules that can cause cellular damage, losing it could make the plants more resilient to stress. Similar mitochondrial gene losses are frequently seen in cancer cells, which is partly why malignant cells can often survive conditions that other cells wouldnâ€™t.</p>
<p>But Petersen isnâ€™t convinced the loss is beneficial at all. It could be that something like a catastrophic mutation befell the mistletoes early in their groupâ€™s evolution, something that accidentally wiped out their ability to make complex I. â€œAnd then mistletoe just managed to cope with what happened,â€� she said, perhaps because mistletoeâ€™s parasitic lifestyle offered ways to compensate. She is curious about whether additional genetic sequencing might let researchers suss out when the loss happened and whether the plants were already parasitic.</p>
<p>If it does turn out that the plantsâ€™ loss of complex I was random bad luck, then perhaps mistletoes are just like the rest of us: Theyâ€™re doing whatever it takes to survive the holidays.</p>

<p>Our newsletter API is live, hosted on a Cloud provider.<br>
We have a basic set of instrumentation to troubleshoot issues that might arise.<br>
There is an exposed endpoint (<code>POST /subscriptions</code>) to subscribe to our content.</p>
<p>We have come a long way!</p>
<p>But we have cut a few corners along the way: <code>POST /subscriptions</code> is fairly... permissive.<br>
Our input validation is extremely limited: we just ensure that both the name and the email fields are provided, nothing else.</p>
<p>We can add a new integration test to probe our API with some "troublesome" inputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]

</span><span>#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_200_when_fields_are_present_but_empty</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// Arrange
    </span><span>let</span><span> app = </span><span>spawn_app</span><span>().await;
    </span><span>let</span><span> client = reqwest::Client::new();
    </span><span>let</span><span> test_cases = vec![
        ("</span><span>name=&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</span><span>", "</span><span>empty name</span><span>"),
        ("</span><span>name=Ursula&amp;email=</span><span>", "</span><span>empty email</span><span>"),
        ("</span><span>name=Ursula&amp;email=definitely-not-an-email</span><span>", "</span><span>invalid email</span><span>"),
    ];

    </span><span>for </span><span>(body, description) in test_cases {
        </span><span>// Act
        </span><span>let</span><span> response = client
            .</span><span>post</span><span>(&amp;format!("</span><span>{}</span><span>/subscriptions</span><span>", &amp;app.address))
            .</span><span>header</span><span>("</span><span>Content-Type</span><span>", "</span><span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><span>")
            .</span><span>body</span><span>(body)
            .</span><span>send</span><span>()
            .await
            .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>Failed to execute request.</span><span>");

        </span><span>// Assert
        </span><span>assert_eq!(
            </span><span>200</span><span>,

            "</span><span>The API did not return a 200 OK when the payload was {}.</span><span>",
            description 
        );
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The new test, unfortunately, passes.<br>
Although all those payloads are clearly invalid, our API is gladly accepting them, returning a <code>200 OK</code>.<br>
Those troublesome subscriber details end up straight in our database, ready to give us problems down the line when it is time to deliver a newsletter issue.</p>
<p>We are asking for two pieces of information when subscribing to our newsletter: a name and an email.<br>
This chapter will focus on name validation: what should we look out for?</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="1-1-domain-constraints">1.1. Domain Constraints</h2>
<p>It turns out that names are complicated<sup><a href="#patio-names">1</a></sup>.<br>
Trying to nail down what makes a name <em>valid</em> is a fool's errand. Remember that we chose to collect a name to use it in the opening line of our emails - we do not need it to match the real identity of a person, whatever that means in their geography. It would be totally unnecessary to inflict the pain of incorrect or overly prescriptive validation on our users.</p>
<p>We could thus settle on simply requiring the name field to be non-empty (as in, it must contain at least a non-whitespace character).</p>
<h2 id="1-2-security-constraints">1.2. Security Constraints</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, not all people on the Internet are good people.<br>
Given enough time, especially if our newsletter picks up traction and becomes successful, we are bound to capture the attention of malicious visitors.<br>
Forms and user inputs are a primary attack target - if they are not properly sanitised, they might allow an attacker to mess with our database (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>), execute code on our servers, crash our service and other nasty stuff.<br>
Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>What is likely to happen in our case? What should we brace for in the wild range of possible attacks?<sup><a href="#threat-modelling">2</a></sup><br>
We are building an email newsletter, which leads us to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>denial of service - e.g. trying to take our service down to prevent other people from signing up. A common threat for basically any online service;</li>
<li>data theft - e.g. steal a huge list of email addresses;</li>
<li>phishing - e.g. use our service to send what looks like a legitimate email to a victim to trick them into clicking on some links or perform other actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we try to tackle all these threats in our validation logic?<br>
Absolutely not!<br>
But it is good practice to have a layered security approach<sup><a href="#defense-in-depth">3</a></sup>: by having mitigations to reduce the risk for those threats at multiple levels in our stack (e.g. input validation, parametrised queries to avoid SQL injection, escaping parametrised input in emails, etc.) we are less likely to be vulnerable should any of those checks fail us or be removed later down the line.</p>
<p>We should always keep in mind that software is a living artifact: holistic understanding of a system is the first victim of the passage of time.<br>
You have the whole system in your head when writing it down for the first time, but the next developer touching it will not - at least not from the get-go. It is therefore possible for a load-bearing check in an obscure corner of the application to disappear (e.g. HTML escaping) leaving you exposed to a class of attacks (e.g. phishing).<br>
Redundancy reduces risk.</p>
<p>Let's get to the point - what validation should we perform on names to improve our security posture given the class of threats we identified?<br>
I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforcing a maximum length. We are using <code>TEXT</code> as type for our email in Postgres, which is virtually unbounded - well, until disk storage starts to run out. Names come in all shapes and forms, but 256 characters should be enough for the greatest majority of our users<sup><a href="#longest-name">4</a></sup> - if not, we will politely ask them to enter a nickname.</li>
<li>Reject names containing troublesome characters. <code>/()"&lt;&gt;\{}</code> are fairly common in URLs, SQL queries and HTML fragments - not as much in names<sup><a href="#xkcd">5</a></sup>. Forbidding them raises the complexity bar for SQL injection and phishing attempts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's have a look at our request handler, as it stands right now:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/routes/subscriptions.rs
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::{web, HttpResponse};
</span><span>use </span><span>chrono::Utc;
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::PgPool;
</span><span>use </span><span>uuid::Uuid;

#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(serde::Deserialize)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>FormData {
    </span><span>email</span><span>: String,
    </span><span>name</span><span>: String,
}

#[</span><span>tracing</span><span>::</span><span>instrument</span><span>(
    name = "</span><span>Adding a new subscriber</span><span>",
    </span><span>skip</span><span>(form, pool),
    </span><span>fields</span><span>(
        email = %form.email,
        name = %form.name
    )
)]
</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe</span><span>(
    </span><span>form</span><span>: web::Form&lt;FormData&gt;,
    </span><span>pool</span><span>: web::Data&lt;PgPool&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, HttpResponse&gt; {
    </span><span>insert_subscriber</span><span>(&amp;pool, &amp;form)
        .await
        .</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|_| HttpResponse::InternalServerError().</span><span>finish</span><span>())?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().</span><span>finish</span><span>())
}

</span><span>// [...]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Where should our new validation live?</p>
<p>A first sketch could look somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/routes/subscriptions.rs
 
// An extension trait to provide the `graphemes` method 
// on`String` and `&amp;str`
</span><span>use </span><span>unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation;

</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe</span><span>(
    </span><span>form</span><span>: web::Form&lt;FormData&gt;,
    </span><span>pool</span><span>: web::Data&lt;PgPool&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, HttpResponse&gt; {
    </span><span>if </span><span>!</span><span>is_valid_name</span><span>(&amp;form.name) {
        </span><span>return </span><span>Err(HttpResponse::BadRequest().</span><span>finish</span><span>());
    }
    </span><span>insert_subscriber</span><span>(&amp;pool, &amp;form)
        .await
        .</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|_| HttpResponse::InternalServerError().</span><span>finish</span><span>())?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().</span><span>finish</span><span>())
}

</span><span>/// Returns `true` if the input satisfies all our validation constraints

    </span><span>!(is_empty_or_whitespace || is_too_long || contains_forbidden_characters)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>To compile the new function successfully we will have to add the <code>unicode-segmentation</code> crate to our dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> add unicode-segmentation
</span></code></pre>
<p>While it <em>looks like</em> a perfectly fine solution (assuming we add a bunch of tests), functions like <code>is_valid_name</code> give us a false sense of safety.</p>

<p>Let's shift our attention to <code>insert_subscriber</code>.<br>
Let's imagine, for a second, that it requires <code>form.name</code> to be non-empty otherwise something horrible is going to happen (e.g. a panic!).</p>
<p>Can <code>insert_subscriber</code> safely assume that <code>form.name</code> will be non-empty?<br>
Just by looking at its <em>type</em>, it cannot: <code>form.name</code> is a <code>String</code>. There is no guarantee about its content.<br>
If you were to look at our program in its entirety you might say: we are checking that it is non-empty at the edge, in the request handler, therefore we can safely assume that <code>form.name</code> will be non-empty every time <code>insert_subscriber</code> is invoked.</p>
<p>But we had to shift from a <em>local</em> approach (let's look at this function's parameters) to a <em>global</em> approach (let's scan the whole codebase) to make such a claim.<br>
And while it might be feasible for a small project such as ours, examining all the calling sites of a function (<code>insert_subscriber</code>) to ensure that a certain validation step has been performed beforehand quickly becomes unfeasible on larger projects.</p>
<p>If we are to stick with <code>is_valid_name</code>, the only viable approach is validating <em>again</em> <code>form.name</code> inside <code>i…</code></p></article></section></div>

You will learn all the basics about the CPU power management in this post.</p><p>The processor/CPU is designed to operate forever under a specific load. As almost none of us are doing a <code>24x7</code> calculation employing all the resources of the CPU continuously, it is most of the time not operating in its designed maximum. So what is the point of keeping the whole CPU powered on at its full capacityÂ&nbsp;? This is the point of CPU power management. The power management topic covers much more than this, including the RAM, GPU etc., but I am going to tell you only about the CPU side of the story in this post.</p><p>If you know about C-states and P-states and how CPU enters to and exits from these states, probably there is nothing new in this post for you. If not, continue reading.</p><p>I was planning to include a few real-world examples from Linux, but the post was getting longer and taking even more time to finish, so I will do that in another post.</p><p>The general information in this post is applicable to all modern CPUs but the details can be very specific to the individual CPU (esp. to the processor family) and I am using an IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3-1245 v5 @ 3.50GHz, this is a Xeon E3â€“1200 v5 series (formerly Skylake) processor (model number 0x5e).</p><p>The main references used in this post are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-technical-resources.html">Intel(R) Xeon Processor E3â€“1200 v5 Product Family Datasheets</a></li><li><a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/88173/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1245-v5-8M-Cache-3_50-GHz">Intel(R) Xeon Processor E3â€“1245 v5 Product Specification</a></li><li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/white-paper/energy-efficient-platforms-2011-white-paper.pdf">Sofware Impact to Platform Energy-Efficiency (Intel White Paper)</a></li><li><a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf">Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a></li><li><a href="http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_6_2.pdf">ACPI Specification v6.2</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">ACPI page on Wikipedia</a></li><li>Linux Kernel Sources version 4.13.0</li></ul><p>Unless otherwise noted, all original figures and tables are from the datasheet.</p><ul><li>2019/03/01: Added CoreFreq output to last section.</li></ul><p>On its <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/52274/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1245-8M-Cache-3_30-GHz">official product page</a>, my CPU has the following features listed:</p><ul><li>Idle States</li><li>Enhanced Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology</li></ul><p>You can see on the page that “Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle.” and “Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load.”</p><p>You will learn what both of these descriptions mean throughout this post.</p><p>On a production CPU (so not considering the things that can be done while designing the CPU), to save power, you can do two things. You can:</p><ul><li>eliminate the power consumption of a subsystem (a core or other resources like clock or cache) by completely powering it down (so cutting down the voltage, reducing it to zero)</li></ul><p>or</p><ul><li>decrease the power consumption by decreasing the voltage and/or the frequency of the subsystem and/or the whole processor</li></ul><p>The first one is simple to understand, if you shut down the power, you do not consume any power.</p><p>The second requires a bit more explanation. The power consumption of an integrated circuit (such as a processor) is proportional linearly to frequency and quadratically to voltage.</p><p>P ~ f VÂ²</p><blockquote><p>Note for those of you knowing more about digital electronics:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pcpu is actually = Pdynamic + Psc + Pleak</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>On an active CPU, Pdynamic is the most important part, it is the part I mention here, being proportional to the frequency and quadratically to the voltage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Psc=Pshort-circuit is proportional to the frequency.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pleak is proportional to the voltage.</p></blockquote><p>Also, the voltage and frequency is not independent, and seems to have a linear relationship. (<a href="http://async.org.uk/tech-reports/NCL-EEE-MICRO-TR-2015-197.pdf">http://async.org.uk/tech-reports/NCL-EEE-MICRO-TR-2015-197.pdf</a>)</p><p>Higher (serial) performance requires both higher frequency and higher voltage, thus having even a larger effect on the power consumption.</p><p>This depends a lot on the processor but E3â€“1245 v5 @ 3.50 Ghz has Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 80 Watts. This is an average value the CPU can sustain forever (Power Limit/PL1 in the figure below) and it is usually the value that the cooling solutions should be designed at for reliability. Actual power CPU consumes can temporarily go higher (as shown as PL2, PL3 and PL4 in the figure below). TDP is measured under a high-complexity (~worst case) load with all cores active at the base frequency (of 3.50 Ghz).</p><figure><img data-src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/cpu-package-power-control-figure-5-1.png" alt="CPU Package Power Control" src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/cpu-package-power-control-figure-5-1.png"><figcaption><p>CPU Package Power Control</p></figcaption></figure><p>You can see in the figure above that the CPU can consume more power than TDP at PL2 for up to 100 seconds, that is actually quite a long duration.</p><p>The two ways to decrease the power consumption of a processor:</p><ul><li>powering down subsystems</li><li>voltage/frequency reduction</li></ul><p>is accomplished by using:</p><ul><li>C-states</li><li>P-states</li></ul><p>respectively.</p><p>C-states describe the first case, so they are the idle (power saving) states. In order to power down a subsystem, that subsystem should not be running anything, so it should be at idle, doing nothing, executing nothing. So C-state x, Cx, means one or more subsystems of the CPU is at idle, powered down.</p><p>On the other hand, P-states describe the second case, so they are the executing (power saving) states. The subsystem is actually running but it does not require full performance so the voltage and/or frequency it operates is decreased. So P-state x, Px, means the subsystem it refers to (e.g. a CPU core) is operating at a specific (frequency, voltage) pair.</p><p>Because most modern CPUs have multiple cores in a single package, C-states are further divided into core C-states (CC-states) and package C-states (PC-states). The reason for PC-states is there are other (shared) components in the processor that can also be powered down after all cores using them are powered down (e.g. the shared cache). However, as a user or programmer, we cannot control these, since we do not interact with the package directly, but we interact with the individual cores. So we can only affect the CC-states directly, PC-states are indirectly affected based on the CC-states of the cores.</p><p>The states are numbered starting from zero like C0, C1â€¦ and P0, P1… The higher the number is the more power is saved. C0 means no power saving by shutting down something, so everything is powered on. P0 means maximum performance, thus maximum frequency, voltage and power used.</p><p>The basic C-states (defined by ACPI) are:</p><ul><li>C0: Active, CPU/Core is executing instructions. P-states are relevant here, CPU/Core may be operating at its maximum performance (thus at P0) or at a lower performance/power (thus at anything other than P0).</li><li>C1: Halt, nothing is being executed, but it can return to C0 instantenously. Since it is not working (but halted), P-states are not relevant for C1 or any Cx other than C0.</li><li>C2: Stop-Clock, similar to C1 but it takes longer time to go back to C0.</li><li>C3: Sleep. It can go back to C0, but it will take considerably longer time.</li></ul><p>Many modern CPUs have plenty more C-states and according to its datasheet IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3-1200 v5 Family has C0, C1, C1E (C1 Enhanced), C2, C3, C6, C7 and C8.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Discuss some differences between macOS and common Unix systems to help Unix users get familiar with macOS sooner.</p><div>
				
<h2 id="users-and-groups">Users and Groups</h2>

<p>macOS manages users and groups by directory services instead of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and  <code>/etc/group</code>.  Consider a local network, for example, the one in your office, there’re many computers in the network and each has its own files, accounts, etc. A directory service organizes these distributed resources into one single index and makes them look like a directory hierarchy.</p>

<p>For example, <code>/Hosts/PC1</code> represents a host in the network and <code>/Users/Smith</code> represents a user in the network.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>macOS uses the <code>dscl</code> command to interact with directory services.</p>

<p>To list all users on the system, we could run the following.</p>



<p>The first argument sets which datasource we want to retrieve from. A dot means the local datasource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># List groups
dscl . -list /Groups
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-list</code> option lets <code>dscl</code> print subitems of a resource.  Subitems of <code>/Users</code> are all users. Subitems of <code>/Groups</code> are all groups.</p>

<p>If we want to check the information about the resource instead of listing subitems we should use <code>-read</code>. For example, we could check the information of the user <code>Smith</code> like
the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Retrieve the information of Smith
dscl . -read /Users/Smith
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>-read</code> prints keys and values of the specified resource. We could also specify the keys we want.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Get the primary group ID and default shell of Smith
dscl . -read /Users/Smith PrimaryGroupID UserShell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To add a resource, we use <code>dscl . -create</code>. The following command adds a new user <code>belson</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seems ok but it’s actually not. If we try to set a password for <code>belson</code> using <code>sudo passwd belson</code>, <code>passwd</code> will tell us the user doesn’t exist. Because <code>dscl</code> just adds a record to the data source but is doesn’t check the integrity. It doesn’t even assign a UID for <code>belson</code>. We must assign a UID and a primary group for <code>belson</code> after adding it to the datasource by ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UniqueID 511	# UID 511 for example
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson PrimaryGroupID 20	# The staff group
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <code>belson</code> is a Unix user and you can set a password for him using <code>passwd</code>. However, you still can’t login as <code>belson</code> for we don’t assign him a shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UserShell /bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well we can login as <code>belson</code> now but he doesn’t have a home directory. We must create the directory and specify it with <code>dscl</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson NFSHomeDirectory /Users/belson
sudo mkdir /User/belson
sudo chmod -R belson:staff /User/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sounds hell right? But it’s not over. Run <code>dscl . -read /Groups/staff</code> and you will find that
neither the <code>GroupMembers</code> nor the <code>GroupMembership</code> attribute has any information about <code>belson</code>.  We have specified his primary group to <code>staff</code>. But as mentioned above, <code>dscl</code> doesn’t check the integrity. Bidirectional relationships must be maintained manually. This is the real hell.</p>

<p>To solve the user-group relationship problem, we could use <code>dseditgroup</code>. The following command adds <code>belson</code> to the <code>staff</code> group and it takes care of the integrity.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should make a summary here. To create a user <code>belson</code> in the group <code>staff</code>, we need:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UniqueID 511	# UID 511 for example
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson PrimaryGroupID 20	# The staff group
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UserShell /bin/bash
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson NFSHomeDirectory /Users/belson
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
sudo mkdir /User/belson
sudo chmod -R belson:staff /User/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is painful for a system administrator to type so many commands just to create a new user. You must miss <code>adduser</code> and <code>addgroup</code> in Debian so much.</p>

<p>Luckily, since Mac OS X 10.10, the <code>sysadminctl</code> command is provided. It’s a high-level interface of <code>dscl</code>. Type <code>sysadminctl</code> in the terminal to see its usage<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Usage: sysadminctl
	-deleteUser &lt;user name&gt; [-secure || -keepHome] (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-newPassword &lt;new password&gt; -oldPassword &lt;old password&gt; [-passwordHint &lt;password hint&gt;]
	-resetPasswordFor &lt;local user name&gt; -newPassword &lt;new password&gt; [-passwordHint &lt;password hint&gt;] (interactive] || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-addUser &lt;user name&gt; [-fullName &lt;full name&gt;] [-UID &lt;user ID&gt;] [-shell &lt;path to shell&gt;] [-password &lt;user password&gt;] [-hint &lt;user hint&gt;] [-home &lt;full path to home&gt;] [-admin] [-picture &lt;full path to user image&gt;] (interactive] || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-secureTokenStatus &lt;user name&gt;
	-secureTokenOn &lt;user name&gt; -password &lt;password&gt; (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-secureTokenOff &lt;user name&gt; -password &lt;password&gt; (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-guestAccount &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-afpGuestAccess &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-smbGuestAccess &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-automaticTime &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-filesystem status
	-screenLock &lt;immediate || off&gt; -password &lt;password&gt;

Pass '-' instead of password in commands above to request prompt.
'-adminPassword' used mostly for scripted operation. Use '-' or 'interactive' to get the authentication string interactivly. This preferred for security reasons
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <code>sysadminctl</code> to delete <code>belson</code> first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo sysadminctl -deleteUser belson -secure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code>dscl</code> to check the directory service, we could find that everything we did is removed.</p>

<p>Now, we add <code>belson</code> again with <code>sysadminctl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo sysadminctl -addUser belson
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Two commands finish the job.</p>

<h2 id="filesystem-hierarchy">Filesystem Hierarchy</h2>

<p>If you check the root directory, you will see some traditional Unix things like <code>/usr</code>, <code>/var</code>, and <code>/etc</code>. You may also find mac-specified things like <code>/Library</code> <code>/Applications</code>, and <code>/cores</code>.</p>

<p>A list of mac-specified directories with their purposes in the root directory is here<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/private</td>
      <td>Contains the tmp, var, etc, directories. <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/var</code>, <code>/etc</code> are symbolic links to these subdirectories</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Library</td>
      <td>Contains support files for locally installed applications, among other things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/System</td>
      <td>Contains a subdirectory, Library, that holds support files for the system and system applications, among other things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Network</td>
      <td>Contains network-mounted Application, Library, and Users directories, as well as a Servers directory that contains directories mounted by the auto mount daemon.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Users</td>
      <td>Contains home directories for the users on the system. The root user’s home directory is /var/root (actually /private/var/root).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Volumes</td>
      <td>Contains all visible mounted filesystems, including removable media and mounted disk images.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We could make a list to compare some of them with Linux.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>macOS</th>
      <th>Linux</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/System/Library</td>
      <td>/lib</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Library</td>
      <td>/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Users</td>
      <td>/home</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Volumes</td>
      <td>/mnt, /media</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You may be confused here for the difference between <code>/Library</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code>. Which directory should we put libraries into?</p>

<p><code>/Library</code> is for macOS-specified softwares, like the data of things you download from the App Store, and BSD programs shipped with macOS, like modules of pre-installed Perl and of pre-installed Python.</p>

<p><code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code> are for Unix programs installed by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="booting">Booting</h2>

<p>In modern Linux, the first program launched by the kernel is <code>systemd</code>. In macOS it’s <code>launchd</code><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p><code>launchd</code> manages two types of services, <code>LaunchDaemon</code> and <code>LaunchAgent</code>. <code>LaunchDaemon</code> will be launched after the system is booted. <code>LaunchAgent</code> will be launched after a user is logged-in.</p>

<p>If a program needs to be launched after the system is booted, a <code>.plist</code> file is required to be placed into <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> or <code>/System/LaunchDaemons</code>.</p>

<p>If a program needs to be launched after a user logged-in, a <code>.plist</code> file is required to be placed into <code>/Library/LaunchAgents</code> or <code>/System/LaunchAgents</code>, or <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents</code> of the user.</p>

<p>The <code>launchctl</code> command is used to control services of <code>launchd</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># to enable sshd
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

# to disable sshd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>You bought a Mac for development. People told you that you need to do the following two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Install Xcode from the app store</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install command line tools using <code>xcode-select --install</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You finished them, opened the terminal and found everything is familiar. You decided to write a classic Hello World with C to celebrate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
	printf("%s\n", "hello, world");
	return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re using a 3rd party compiler, the compiler may tell you that <code>stdio.h</code> can’t be found.</p>

<p>No such fundamental file? You want to check <code>/usr/include</code> and you will find that even <code>/usr/include</code> doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>The reason is that header files are put into the package of Xcode in newer Xcode like Xcode 10. You can run <code>xcrun --show-sdk-path</code> to print the path<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun --show-sdk-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can use <code>-isysroot</code> to specify the path for the compiler, for example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gcc -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk hello.c
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="package-manager">Package Manager</h2>

<p>The first package installed to the system is usually a package manager. However, macOS has no default package manager. If you search online, you will find that <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the most popular package manager for macOS.</p>

<p>Homebrew is good for many people but not for one who wants things to go more like common Unix systems.</p>

<p>Homebrew can’t run as root. If you want to install python, you run <code>brew install python</code> instead of <code>sudo brew install python</code>. Homebrew installs packages to <code>/usr/local</code>.

		<h2 id="board-view-is-here">Board View is here</h2>

<p>For Todoist users, the Board View was introduced in this new update, a more visual way to organize your Planner projects. This new layout makes it easy to see the big picture of your projects and make progress from start to finish.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/board.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board"></p>

<p>To see your projects in the <b>Board View</b>, press the three dots icon in the top right, and select <b>View as board</b>. You’ll be able to rearrange your sections, create new ones, and drag your tasks to anywhere on your board.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/board-settings.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h2 id="sub-project">Sub-project</h2>
<p>One of the most requested features comes to Planner 2.6, keep your ever-growing project list neat and organized with sub-projects.</p>

<p>You can collapse sub-projects under their “parent” projects to temporarily hide them from view. This helps to focus on the right projects at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-turn-a-project-into-a-sub-project">How to turn a project into a sub-project</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Right click on a project.</li>
  <li>Select the <b>Move</b> option.</li>
  <li>Select a project.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<h3 id="quick-search">Quick Search</h3>

<p>A big update for the Quick Find feature is here, with new views and feactures.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/Quick%20Search.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick Search now saves your last searches, so you can hop around without even typing.</li>
  <li>Added new <b>Tomorrow</b> view.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to search between <b>Sections</b></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-defaults">Task defaults</h3>

<p>Added a new view in <b>Preferences</b> to edit task defaults.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/tasks-defaults.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<ul>
  <li>New tasks on top: Indicate the position where the new tasks were created.</li>
  <li>Underline completed tasks.</li>
  <li>Default priority: Select the default priority when creating a task.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="add-tasks-projects-sections-asynchronously">Add tasks, projects, sections asynchronously</h3>

<p>Adding a task, project or section is a quick process but sometimes this process stops or does not respond mainly to problems with the internet connection. Planner 2.6 creates the tasks asynchronously with the possibility of being able to cancel the process at any time.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/AsyncTask.gif" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h3 id="filter-your-projects-by-labels">Filter your projects by labels</h3>
<p>It is now possible to filter the tasks within a project by labels.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/filter-labels.gif" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>


<p>Labels have been added in the sidebar to make the use of filter by labels much faster.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/label-sidebar.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h3 id="more-customization">More customization</h3>

<p>It is now possible to sort the position <b>Inbox</b>, <b>Today</b> and <b>Upcoming</b> by 
Drag &amp; Drop.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/ActionMoved.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h3 id="code-cleanup--performance-improvement">Code cleanup &amp; performance improvement</h3>
<p>A giant code cleanup was done and resource usage was improved. Now Planner is faster and works much better.</p>

<p>Planner 2.6 is available for download now on <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.alainm23.planner/">AppCenter</a> and <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.alainm23.planner">Flathub</a>. We hope you’ll enjoy these improvements.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Much of my work recently has been in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I’ve
known about Rust since its early days but I’ve never had the inclination to
sit down and work with it until now. In many respects, I feel like I’m working
in a functional programming language given the wide-spread use of <code>map</code> and
closures. This may also just be the fact that C provides almost none of these
constructs.</p>

<p>I recently had a problem that I solved using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">procedural macros</a>
This took a good bit of debugging from me since I’m still coming up to speed
but overall I was pleasantly surprised at the experience. Rust’s type system
makes it easy to find errors and didn’t let me do anything (too) bad. The
trickiest part for me was figuring out how to go between <code>proc_macro</code> and
<code>proc_macro2</code> types (again, something that would have been easier with more
Rust experience).</p>

<p>The entire experience really reminded me of doing compiler work and working
with <a href="https://www.labbott.name/blog/2018/02/28/fun-with-gcc-plugins/">gcc plugins</a>.
With both procedural macros and gcc plugins you are making a change to the
generated code. This can be harder than it looks since even simple code can be
hidden by multiple layers of abstraction (how deep do you have to go to just
get the literal). You really need to know exactly what you are expecting and
also handle errors gracefully. In comparison to gcc plugins, Rust makes
doing this significantly easier. The type system is very helpful as a guide
to figure out what needs to be covered as opposed to hoping you caught
everything in a switch statement. Rust also intends for procedural macros
to be widely used by everyone in contrast to gcc plugins which are intended
for a very limited audience. gcc plugins are expected to break across versions
since the ABI is not stable whereas Rust takes care not to make breaking
changes without serious discussion. One notable limitation of Rust macros is
that they are, in fact, macros operating on the syntax. You cannot make changes
at the code generation level or add new optimization passes. Rust does have
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.3.0/book/compiler-plugins.html">full plugin support</a>
though.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a bit unfair to compare C and Rust macros but I do like the idea
of treating macros as an extension of the language instead of just a simple
(and potentially unsafe) transformation.</p>

<p>Done right, thought leadership content is the single most brand-differentiating content marketing asset a company can produce. But it takes more than just having an opinion.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know when you see a word so many times that it loses its meaning and looks <em>incredibly</em> weird? That’s what happened to the term “thought leadership.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been used so much, by so many people, to gesture toward so many different things, that it’s become fuzzy, almost to the point of being useless. Everybody wants to "do thought leadership content"—but nobody seems to know exactly what that means.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2207,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/is-this-thought-leadership-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>And that’s a shame, because hidden amid all that confusion is a style of content marketing that more brands should be learning to do well. In fact, if your brand is <em>not </em>producing thought leadership content, you are (and I say this with love) messing up.</p><p>The content marketing landscape is extremely crowded. But beyond that, the information landscape writ large is super crowded. Like it or not, you and your brand are competing for your audience’s attention. Your opponent: the entire internet.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need content that will help you win the battle for your audience’s attention, consideration, and, above all, loyalty. And that’s what thought leadership content is all about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>So, What Is Thought Leadership Content?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>The biggest mistake brands make is thinking that thought leadership is a type of content, the same way that how-to posts or ebooks or webinars are a type of content.</p><p>Thought leadership isn’t a <em>type </em>of content—it’s an <em>approach </em>to content.</p><p>When you say you want to “do thought leadership,” what you’re articulating is the relationship you want your company to have with your space. You’re describing how you want your brand to be seen—by your customers, by your competitors, and by your industry as a whole.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>I want my brand to be seen as a leading authority in my industry/discipline.</em></li><li><em>I want my audience to look to me as a source of relevant insights about the bigger-picture developments happening in our space.</em></li><li><em>I want my competitors to read my content and say, “Why didn’t we write that?”</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Creating knowledge without sharing it is elitism.</p><p>Sharing knowledge without creating it is marketing.</p><p>Creating knowledge for the purpose of sharing it is thought leadership.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaturdayThoughts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SaturdayThoughts</a></p></div>— Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1210919096860258305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2019</a></blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Researcher, author, and thought leader </em><a href="https://www.adamgrant.net/"><em><u>Adam Grant</u></em></a><em> understands that real thought leadership is made, not borrowed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>The other important thing to understand is that in order for content to rise to the level of thought leadership, it has to be authentic. It has to be deeply rooted in your unique perspective or experience or expertise. That doesn’t necessarily mean that it has to be completely original, but it has to belong to you and your brand in a way that is recognizably you.</p><p>You know that you want to establish your brand as a thought leader in your space, and you know that you’re ready to produce the kind of authentic, grounded content necessary to make that happen. Now you have to figure out: what kind of inputs do you have at your disposal that will help you do that?</p></div>

<h2>Five Sources of High-Quality Thought Leadership Content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you find yourself sitting in front of a blank Google doc, saying, “Okay, time to do some thought leadership content,” and then drawing a complete blank on what that should look like, here’s a hint: look upstream. Most of the important work in producing thought leadership content happens <em>way </em>before you put any words to paper. It starts with asking yourself: <em>What do I have to “thought lead” with in the first place?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few years ago, Ben Horowitz introduced what, to this day, is one of my favorite business strategy concepts: the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/a16z/earned-secrets-ben-horowitz-interns-2018">earned secret</a>. On the a16z podcast, Horowitz explains it this way:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote><p><em>"You did something in your past to solve a hard problem and learned something about the world that not a lot of other people know."</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experience is one way to develop an earned secret, but it’s not the only one. Sometimes you just see something that no one else in the market is seeing. That insight is no less earned than experience is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However you come by them, your earned secrets are the core of your competitive advantage in business; they’re the core of your competitive advantage in content as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thought leadership content is all about surfacing those earned secrets—the unique perspectives, experiences, and resources you have that inform your product and the philosophy of your brand—and sharing them with your audience for the purpose of building credibility, trust and, ultimately, loyalty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The question is, what earned secrets do you have that you can pour into thought leadership content?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Five Sources of Thought Leadership Content</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Counter-narrative opinions</li><li>Personal narrative</li><li>Network connections</li><li>Industry analysis</li><li>Data storytelling</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2202,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Everybody-Wants-Thought-Leadership-1-1-1024x783.png" alt=""></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>There is overlap between these categories, and you can absolutely play in more than one from post to post or even within the same post. Data can inform top-tier industry analysis. A strong counter-narrative opinion often goes hand in hand with the personal story that led you to arrive at that opinion.</p><p>But each of these inputs, on its own, is plenty to generate high-quality thought leadership content.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. <strong>Counter-Narrative Opinions</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may be familiar with the phrase “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/style/narrative-violation-venture-capital-tech.html">narrative violation</a>”: something, usually a company or product, that breaks from the consensus of how things are supposed to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a <strong>strongly held opinion</strong> that goes against the conventional wisdom of your industry or discipline, you are a prime candidate for some counter-narrative thought leadership content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>The canonical example of this style of thought leadership content is <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. Cofounders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson (aka DHH) have built their brand with their incredibly strong opinions about how business should be done and, just as importantly, how it shouldn’t.</p><p>You may be familiar with their greatest hits:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Most meetings are a waste of time.</li><li>Email clients are annoying and intrusive.</li><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm"><u>It doesn’t have to be crazy at work</u></a>.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2210,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-4.57.13-PM-1024x492.png" alt=""></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Writing an entire best-selling book about your perspective on running a business = </em>the final evolution of the <em>thought leadership Pokemon.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DHH and Fried’s opinions aren’t random. They’re closely tethered to the products that the Basecamp team builds and the type of talent they’re looking to attract.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So when Jason or DHH is strongly opining about the state of business, they’re not trolling peers who disagree with them for fun; they are doing thought leadership. They are actively cultivating a connection between their brand and the people who resonate with their brand’s point of view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I haven’t sent an email for the beta but I am ready to just pay <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dhh</a> for hey and will subscribe day 1. Why would I do that? I trust them to get it right and we need more independent email providers!</p>— Zachary Gershman (@zachgersh) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachgersh/status/1250602073512648704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Counter-narrative thought leadership is not about being contrarian for the sake of it. <strong>It’s not enough to be contrarian. Thought leadership content also has to ring <em>true.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>We’ve <em>all </em>had the experience of reading something put out by someone we admire and thinking: YES. THANK YOU!</p><p><em>That’s </em>the feeling that good counter-narrative thought leadership aims to inspire. And finding that <strong>counterintuitively true</strong> thing is the art and science (but mostly art) of counter-narrative thought leadership content.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, opinions come from simple observation or from accumulations of experience that are too diffuse to point to directly and say, “Here’s how I learned this.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other times, opinions arise from specific, concrete stories—stories that need to be shared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. <strong>Personal Narrative</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there’s one thing that people love, it’s a good story. The human brain is hardwired to respond to stories with a beginning, a middle, and an end and with people, places, and things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which means that telling a story about you, what you’ve learned, and what brought you to the place that you are today can be an amazing way to do thought leadership content, provided you have a story to tell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our go-to example for this type of thought leadership content is Chris Savage, co-founder and CEO at <a href="https://wistia.com/about">Wistia</a>. Chris is a pro at turning reflections on his experiences with building and growing Wistia into thoughtful, compelling thought leadership content that founders and people in the tech scene are excited to read.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One example: this post from a few years ago, where Chris and Wistia cofounder Brendan Schwartz share the story of <a href="https://wistia.com/learn/culture/taking-on-debt-to-grow-our-own-way">how an offer to sell Wistia</a> led them to buy out their investors and take on $17M in debt financing instead.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>In this post, Chris and Brendan not only share the story of what happened with the refinancing. They share the philosophy of business-building that informed it.</p><p>That philosophy underlies <em>everything </em>about the Wistia brand and product -- not least, their championing of <a href="https://wistia.com/about/brand-affinity-marketing">brand affinity</a> as a marketing strategy.

		<p><strong>About Outer Orbit</strong><br>
		<em>Outer Orbit</em> is an attempt to create a “Spacewar!-for-one” as a tribute to the line of heritage of digital video games. It combines elements of the most classic shooter games, <em>Spacewar!</em> (1961/62) <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/">[1]</a>, the first known video game on a digital computer, <em>Computer Space</em> (1971) <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/rc2017/04/02.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/icss/" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4]</a>, the first coin-operated digital video game, and <em>Asteroids</em> (1979) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5]</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From <em>“<a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/" target="_blank">Spacewar!</a>”</em> it borrows the comic book spaceship, the central star, gravity and orbital mechanics,</li>
			<li>from <em>“<a href="https://www.masswerk.at/icss/" target="_blank">Computer Space</a>”</em> the game mechanics of the saucer opponents and the time-based gameplay,</li>
			<li>from <em>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asteroids</a>”,</em> well, the asteroids, which serve here just as additional obstacles to make the game a bit trickier.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> A wave has a fixed duration of 80 seconds. You may progress to the next wave/level, if you manage to outscore the saucers in a given level, i.e. shoot the saucers more often than your ship crashes, by this maintaining a positive balance. Mind that the balance is reset to zero at the start of each level.</p>
		<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Like in <em>Spacewar!</em> enter an orbit around the gravitational star by aligning your spaceship perpendicular to its center and firing your thruster for two or three seconds. — Do not attempt to destroy asteroids, dodge them.</p>
		<p><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> The sound-scape is for the most a homage to <em>Computer Space,</em> less the background hum. The display font is based on definitions for a PDP-1 font renderer (early 1960s) and implemented in software. In order to bring the iterative machanics of a gravity based game to the modern age of asynchronous rendering, the game is computed internally in fixed time slices of an 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a second and the display rendered on demand.</p>
		<p><strong>Setting an Initial Level:</strong> Experienced players may want to select the initial level by specifying a wave as an URL-parameter, as in <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/outerorbit/?wave=30">https://www.masswerk.at/outerorbit/?wave=30</a> for a game starting at wave #30.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: https://logolix.com/</p>



<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Joven Babovic</p>



<p><strong>Revenue</strong>: $4k MRR</p>



<p><strong>Product</strong>: “Free logo design for your projects.”</p>



<p><strong>Who is Joven Babovic and what business he started?</strong></p>



<p>Joven Babovic is a brand designer from Belgrade, Serbia. He is working on a productized logo design agency for tech founders, called Logolix, which starts three years ago.</p>



<p><strong>What is the backstory behind logolix and how he comes up with the idea?</strong></p>



<p>Back from 2012 to 2017, Joven is doing freelancing and participating in the design competition. But the competition on this platform is rapidly increasing, so he decided to start his agency. Logo design is a passion for Joven. But the problem is that compony only need new look ones every few years. That’s why he needs to find a new client after every work done. But he needs a steady stream of leads.</p>



<p>He analyzed the market and start plan what to do next and came up with an idea to give his some logo design for free. As he was designing the logo for three years and every client need 3-4 logos to choose the good one. However, after taking the best logos, the other logo is still unused, so he used that logos for people who were testing their ideas but don’t have money to spend on good looking logo’s. And give it free for them, hoping that they would come back and order a custom design later.</p>



<p>And this work for Joven is a stream of clients for three years without any additional marketing.</p>



<p><strong>How Joven came up with the prototype of his idea?</strong></p>



<p>Joven takes two weeks to create it’s the initial product.<br>He used a theme from ThemeForest as he is not a developer, but he has a good knowledge of customizing ThemeForest themes. Other then theme he purchased a domain and hosting which cost him around $100.</p>



<p>Here are the full steps involved in the two weeks of making initial product<br>1 Sort out best logos and package them for easy download.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>Write down landing page copy and created three different pricing packages</li><li>Customize the theme to match Logolix branding and add all of the logos</li><li>Create the design brief and integrate Typeform into the website.</li><li>Upload the website and make sure everything is functioning correctly (Google Analytics, Typeform, Download feature, Contact form, etc.)</li><li>Prepare the images and copy to launch on Product Hunt</li><li>Launch!</li></ol>



<p>He didn’t spend too much time on MVP and focused on the product’s back end and delivering exceptional service.</p>



<p><strong>Since launch what worked for Jovan to attract customers for logolix</strong>.</p>



<p>Joven knows the importance of freemium model people wanted to try something before they purchased it and that realize Joven that founders didn’t want to spend money on a new logo when just testing their ideas.</p>



<p>For getting customers, he researched where tech founders spend their time online, and that’s when he found product hunt. He saw many products are launching on product hunt, but the competition for logo design category didn’t have much competition.</p>



<p>And after a few days later Joven launched Logolix on Producthunt<br>And go to sleep after wake up he saw 11 new inquiries and Logolix got #1 product of the day with 780 upvotes. Logolix got 12000 visits, but the traffic is slowly died off in the next month.</p>



<p>Other then that referral is the most significant source of new clients for logolix.</p>



<p>Logolix started as a side hustle, and Joven doesn’t have any plan to scale it as it only provides additional income and allow him to work on projects that he likes to enjoy.</p>



<p><strong>Joven future plans with logolix</strong></p>



<p>Joven wants to write a guest post for getting extra exposure for logolix.</p>



<p>Other than that Joven wants to start a unique productized service soon.</p>



<p><strong>Through starting Logolix what challenges Joven faced. And how he overcome those.</strong></p>



<p>The first mistake Joven did is that he get too excited after launch and after checking 12 orders, as he gets one to three clients per month, after seeing 12 orders at once, he gets a burden. He cancelled some order and worked with good earning potential orders if he takes all order and finds a good designer of its level to scale logolix to a different story.</p>



<p>The second mistake was to redesigning logolix landing page several time, which got him to bounce rate.<br>Here Is the lesson: don’t make massive changes if something is already working, just because you think it will work even better. Follow the data and try to improve your product step-by-step slowly.</p>



<p><strong>Through starting Logolix what Joven learn which is particularly helpful or advantages for him?</strong></p>



<p>I can’t pinpoint specific advice that helped me, but immersing myself in digital marketing content and the SaaS world gave me many insights. I wouldn’t have even thought of promoting my logos by giving them away for free if there wasn’t a SaaS article about freemiums.</p>



<p><strong>Advice from Joven for future entrepreneurs who were starting?</strong></p>



<p>Just start something. You don’t learn until you launch and nothing will be as you planned. You might fail bad, but take it as a lesson. You might also succeed beyond your wildest predictions.<br>Everything is about the mindset, and this cannot be overstated. I used to be a wantrepreneur and never thought that I could somehow scale my skills beyond selling $200 logos. Start believing in yourself and follow what people on the next level are doing. Don’t copy, but emulate.</p>



<p>One more piece of advice for anyone in the creative profession is to read Steven Pressfield’s work. I used to continually battle with procrastination until his books showed me a way out. If you struggle to start a new project or wait until the deadline to complete a task, resistance beats you. You have to learn how to overcome it if you want to achieve something great. Anyways, he’ll explain it much better than me.</p>

      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>

    </p></div>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>

						<p>A peer-driven performance feedback is the key mechanism to how talent is managed at some of the largest tech companies today. The interpretation of this feedback by a calibrated committee drives compensation, career progression and improvement interventions. The effort that goes into planning and executing the work such that it resonates with the committee is substantial. At best, this pushes the naturally disorganized people towards structure, at worst it is just a marketing exercise that costs companies weeks across all talent every year. Either way, companies place a huge bet on this system driving their workforce towards improvement, and ultimately, impact.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong with this?</strong></p><p>If you read a book about competitive differentiation (e.g. <em><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDifferent-Escaping-Competitive-Youngme-Moon%2Fdp%2F030746086X&amp;t=OTYwYmY0ZDBjNzQ4ZTNmMzFjMDg0NDRhMjUzMDQ2MDI5MWJmMWVjYixQQUZwUWtYNA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A315KupBxXHJip6ohDuRWcw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsvonava.com%2Fpost%2F638405510100664320%2Fmanage-for-impact-not-performance&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159729">Different</a></em>), you find that a set of products within one category gets more homogeneous over time. Basically, they all copy each other’s unique selling points and address their weaknesses until the difference is superficial. This is facilitated by a set of metrics all products within the category get judged by - over time all metrics of all participants converge to the mean.</p><p>When we manage performance along a set of defined criteria, we get the same effect - a homogenous workforce, where innovation and playing to one’s strength just doesn’t happen. Now - this is exactly what we need if we are trying to squeeze out percentage points of efficiency. But when you listen to the CEOs of even the largest tech companies today - they talk about crazy new opportunities on one hand and existential fear on the other. In an environment like that, we shouldn’t be trying to optimize for the lowest common denominator of our collective weaknesses - but rather equip our employees to play to their strengths and take bold bets.</p><p><strong>But how do we do that?</strong></p><p>At Google, I kept hearing the same story over and over again - a senior engineer, pushing for promotion, but too heavy on leadership with not enough code output. A Front-end engineer driving a ton of value in their product, but not solving ‘complex enough’ problems. <em><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmtlynch.io%2Fwhy-i-quit-google%2F&amp;t=ZGU1ZDAyN2VmNjAxOWM5NDdjNzIwNjFiNWMzYmUwODgzNWEyMDc1ZCxQQUZwUWtYNA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A315KupBxXHJip6ohDuRWcw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsvonava.com%2Fpost%2F638405510100664320%2Fmanage-for-impact-not-performance&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159729">Here</a></em> is a story of a Googler who contributed to multiple projects, drove a ton of impact - but had trouble because his work didn’t conform to the rubric. The current performance review model forces all of these people to switch their focus away from where they have impact towards where they have a weakness.</p><p><strong>Why is the system set up this way?</strong></p><p>I think that we are afraid to measure impact. We also want to reward good process, not just good outcomes. But at the end of the day, if a person can create value in the internal ‘marketplace’ of a company - that’s a key signal. We are afraid that maybe all engineers just want to go around and lead - so we push them to also produce code. The thing is, if, for example, there is enough opportunity for engineers to write simple frontends and deliver a ton of value - then this is the right thing for them to do, instead of chasing ‘enough complexity’ for a promotion.</p><p><strong>The fix: Impact management.</strong></p><p>Sure, let’s run a basic performance review, so people can keep track of their blind spots. But we should spend more effort on an impact review with a less rigid structure, with a constant and opportunistic data collection, instead of a regular cycle. Did you fix a legacy pipeline with no direct monetary implication - but now a ton of dependent engineers have 1 thing less to worry about? Get a few testimonials where they try to quantify how much you help them. Did you spend a month on gruntwork, documenting an obscure sub-system and now a few teams hit their OKRs because they could build their integrations much faster? They should give you credit.</p><p>Then, when you accumulate enough impact, you get promoted. If even after a year your impact isn’t there, you should get coached to lean more into your strengths and identify opportunities. Your manager might also need help in enabling you. The current half-yearly cycle is absurd when some folks need just a few months to accumulate 2 promotions worth of impact.</p><p>In many companies, <strong>there are fragments of this already</strong> in place:</p><ul><li>Internal recognition systems (‘kudos’ at Google).</li><li>The currency of impact is quantified and attributed with OKRs.</li><li>The unstructured part of the performance review where people write a long prose months after they worked with you which is nice, but not like a testimonial extracted at the value delivery time.</li></ul><p>With most of the building blocks in place and the huge energy already going into performance reviews, implementing something like the above is feasible.</p><p><strong>What do you think?</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/svonava/status/1342163637050474497">Join the conversation on twitter!</a></p>

                                <p><strong>What does the trait bound <code>'static</code> mean in Rust?</strong></p>
<p>After a few weeks of programming in Rust we should have a pretty good idea of what a <code>'static</code> reference is, but a <code>'static</code> trait bound can seem a bit more mysterious.</p>
<p>The first time I had to add a <code>'static</code> trait bound to my code. I didn't feel like I understood what was happening, because there were no references involved. In fact, the only data involved were function arguments being passed by ownership, which is usually a pretty reliable way of avoiding borrow checker problems.</p>
<p>In many cases, the rust compiler will suggest a <code>'static</code> trait bound to address a problem. The compiler is probably right, but let's explore what it really means so we can be confident that we understand the solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://codeandbitters.com/images/rust_logo_hand_drawn_1b.png" alt="Rust Logo" width="320" height="256"></p>
<h4 id="part-1-we-introduce-a-bug-and-the-compiler-helps-us-fix-it">Part 1: We introduce a bug and the compiler helps us fix it.<a href="#part-1-we-introduce-a-bug-and-the-compiler-helps-us-fix-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: part-1-we-introduce-a-bug-and-the-compiler-helps-us-fix-it">🔗</a></h4>
<p>Let's use this code as our example:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: File) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That function works fine. However, I would like to be able to test the code but don't want my tests to actually create real files. Tests sometimes crash, after all, and it's a pain to ensure that tests always clean up after themselves. It's also no fun to debug unreliable test automation because the box ran out of scratch space due to tests leaking temporary files.</p>
<p>Instead, let's make <code>read_in_background</code> generic across a broader set of types:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>&lt;T: Read&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: T) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This change makes the compiler sad, though:</p>
<pre><code><span>error[E0277]: `T` cannot be sent between threads safely
   --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:5
    |
6   |       thread::spawn(move || {
    |  _____^^^^^^^^^^^^^_-
    | |     |
    | |     `T` cannot be sent between threads safely
7   | |         let mut buf = Vec::&lt;u8&gt;::new();
8   | |         if let Ok(count) = f.read_to_end(&amp;mut buf) {
9   | |             println!("read {} bytes from file.", count);
10  | |         }
11  | |     });
    | |_____- within this `[closure@src/lib.rs:6:19: 11:6]`
</span></code></pre>
<p>The Rust compiler has a suggestion to improve our function: because we're calling <code>thread::spawn</code>, it would like our data to be safe to send between threads.</p>
<pre><code><span>help: consider further restricting this bound
    |
5   | pub fn read_in_background&lt;T: Read + Send&gt;(mut f: T) {
</span></code></pre>
<p>That suggestion seems sensible. Let's do what it says; we'll add a <code>Send</code> bound to our generic type.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>&lt;T: Read + Send&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: T) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The compiler is still unsatisfied, though:</p>
<pre><code><span>error[E0310]: the parameter type `T` may not live long enough
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:5
  |
5 | pub fn read_in_background&lt;T: Read + Send&gt;(mut f: T) {
  |                           -- help: consider adding an explicit lifetime bound...: `T: 'static +`
6 |     thread::spawn(move || {
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...so that the type `[closure@src/lib.rs:6:19: 11:6]` will meet its required lifetime bounds
</span></code></pre>
<p>The compiler is unhappy about lifetimes, and suggests we add a trait bound <code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler's <code>help</code> message has suggested the right thing (though it's not yet clear how or why). First, let's do what it says, just to see that it does work:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>&lt;T: Read + Send + </span><span>'static</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: T) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And the compiler is happy! I can write tests that use <code>std::io::Cursor</code> instead of <code>File</code>, and now my tests don't need to write things to the filesystem.</p>
<h4 id="part-2-what-just-happened-anyway">Part 2: What just happened, anyway?<a href="#part-2-what-just-happened-anyway" aria-label="Anchor link for: part-2-what-just-happened-anyway">🔗</a></h4>
<p>That <code>'static</code> nags at me. I passed the <code>T</code> (<code>File</code> or <code>Cursor</code> or whatever) by transferring ownership. There were no references in use, so why is a lifetime bound needed?</p>
<p>The answer is that when we create a generic type <code>T</code>, we need to convince the compiler that our function must work for all possible types (that satisfy the bounds <code>Read + Send</code>). Some of those types <strong>might be references!</strong> Or might include references internally.</p>
<p>Let's build an alternate universe version of our function, before we made it generic:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> File) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The only thing I changed is that the argument is now type <code>&amp;mut File</code> instead of <code>File</code>, so we're passing in a reference with an un-specified lifetime.</p>
<p>The compiler dislikes this, and expresses itself with a familiar message:</p>
<pre><code><span>error[E0621]: explicit lifetime required in the type of `f`
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:5
  |
5 | pub fn read_in_background(f: &amp;mut File) {
  |                              --------- help: add explicit lifetime `'static` to the type of `f`: `&amp;'static mut std::fs::File`
6 |     thread::spawn(move || {
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ lifetime `'static` required
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code could have worked, except that anything sent through the wormhole into <code>thread::spawn</code> may need to live for an arbitrary amount of time. The only solution available to us is to tag that reference with <code>'static</code> to ensure we don't violate memory safety rules. (Alternatively, we could go looking for a <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.8.0/crossbeam/thread/index.html">scoped thread implementation</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's an interesting fact: the <code>Read</code> trait is implemented for <code>&amp;File</code>! Had the compiler not forced us to add a <code>'static</code> bound, our generic implementation with <code>T: Read + Send</code> could accept <code>&amp;File</code> without being able to prove a correct lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way that I often think about the <code>'static</code> trait bound is:</p>
<p><em><strong>"I don't want my generic type <code>T</code> to permit reference types."</strong></em></p>
<p>That's not strictly true, because we know it will allow references that can live forever. But for the sake of simplicity, when I want to pass ownership of a real value, I don't want to think about the compiler allowing references under certain peculiar conditions. Instead I am going to use a lazy mental shortcut, and allow myself to believe that <code>'static</code> means "don't allow references".</p>
<p>There's another possible case, which is a type that has internal references. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>MyCursor&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>data</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>],
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; Read </span><span>for </span><span>MyCursor&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>buf</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; std::result::Result&lt;</span><span>usize</span><span>, std::io::Error&gt; {
        </span><span>let</span><span> size = </span><span>min</span><span>(buf.</span><span>len</span><span>(), </span><span>self</span><span>.data.</span><span>len</span><span>());
        buf[..size].</span><span>copy_from_slice</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.data[..size]);
        Ok(size)
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is perhaps a bit silly, because <code>std::io::Cursor&lt;&amp;[u8]&gt;</code> already exists. But it illustrates the point: even if we try to pass ownership of <code>MyCursor</code> to our generic <code>read_in_background</code>, the compiler should prevent us.</p>
<p>This provides a slightly less lazy way of thinking about the <code>T: 'static</code> trait bound: imagine that any potential <code>T</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Thing&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; {
    ...
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We are using the bound <code>T: 'static</code> to restrict <code>Thing&lt;'a&gt;</code> to <code>Thing&lt;'static&gt;</code>. If the type doesn't have any generic lifetime parameters, then that bound is automatically satisfied. It's as though every data structure without a generic lifetime parameter has an implicit <code>&lt;'static&gt;</code> attached.</p>

<p>The same basic principle applies if I want <code>read_in_background</code> to be part of a trait.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>BgRead {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>);
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; BgRead </span><span>for </span><span>T
</span><span>where</span><span>
    T: Read + Send + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        </span><span>// ...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This works fine. It's also possible to attach some or all of the trait bounds to the trait definition itself:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>BgRead: Send + 'static {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>);
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Why attach the trait bounds to the trait definition, if it's not necessary to make the code work? I can think of a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe BgRead would never make sense for reference types, and we want to convey that expectation to humans reading the code.</li>
<li>The compiler will complain right away if we accidentally allow a reference type. This might save us a little time when adding new <code>impl</code>s, by making the mistake obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate this, imagine we decide to implement the <code>BgRead</code> trait for any type <code>Into&lt;String&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; BgRead </span><span>for </span><span>T
</span><span>where</span><span>
    T: Into&lt;String&gt;,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
            </span><span>let</span><span> s: String = </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>into</span><span>();
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from string.</span><span>", s.</span><span>len</span><span>());
        });
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We won't get very far with this code, because we try to send <code>self</code> to another thread (which will require <code>Send + 'static</code>), and the compiler will say so clearly. If our code were more complex, it might not be as obvious what's wrong— perhaps the value gets passed down through layers of generic functions before the error appears.</p>
<p>It might save some time if we communicate with future implementers of <code>BgRead</code> by putting those trait bounds on the trait itself. If they turn out to be wrong, it will probably be easy to loosen the bounds on the trait later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2089-implied-bounds.md">Rust RFC 2089, implied_bounds</a>, which would allow us to omit the trait bounds on an <code>impl</code> if they were already expressed in the trait itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this was helpful! Good luck with your Rust projects.</p>

            <p>
                Posted on <time datetime="2020-12-24 09:53:00">December 24, 2020</time>
            </p>
                        <p>According to conventional wisdom, if you earn 31€/hour, and a task costs less than that to outsource, then you should always pay someone else to do it. For example, if your cleaning person charges 15€/hour, you save 16€ for every hour you spend at work instead of cleaning your house.</p>
<p>I've encountered this advice quite often, particularly among the wealthier, productivity porn-loving, <em>4-Hour Work Week</em>-thumping entrepreneur crowd.<br></p>
<p>I don't think that advice is quite right.</p>
<h2>Your time is worth less than you think</h2>
<p>There is a hefty tax on converting time to money. In Germany, if you earned the average income (42 421€ per year)<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a></sup>, you'd lose roughly a quarter of it to income tax<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=einkommensteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup>. Your 31€/hour salary<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a>, <a href="https://clockify.me/working-hours">2</a></sup> is actually worth 24€/hour after taxes.</p>
<p>But there is more to account for: health insurance (7.3%), unemployment insurance (1.25%), public pension (9.3%) and nursing care insurance (1.775%)<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=lohnsteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup> are also deducted from your salary. When it's all said and done, you take home about 20€/hour. If you also pay church tax and get the most expensive health insurance, you keep 19€/hour.</p>
<p>So again, if you earn the average 31€/hour, and work the average 1386 hours per year, you save about 4€ per hour - not 16€ - by hiring a cleaning person who charges half your rate.</p>
<p>Taxes aren't the only thing that whittle away your disposable income. You also have some unavoidable expenses, namely rent, groceries and utilities. That's 550€, 150€ and 100€ per month for a single, thrifty Berliner. That's 35% of your take-home salary, so you're left with 12.50€/hour in disposable income. At this point, I'm including decimals, because they start to matter.</p>
<p>In other words, you must sell 72 minutes of your life to buy 60 minutes of your cleaning person's life, even though you earn twice as much.</p>
<p>Here's a recap for the mathematically inclined:</p>
<pre>hourly_disposable income = (
    (gross_income - income_tax)
    - health_insurance
    - unemployment_insurance
    - pension_insurance
    - nursing_care_insurance
    - (rent + groceries + utilities) * 12
) / hours_worked_per_year</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this describes the reality in Germany, where people work much less, but pay higher taxes. You will get wildly different results in your own country.</p>
<h2>Outsourcing costs more than you think</h2>
<p>Eating out is often used as an example of trading money for time. It's faster than cooking your own food: no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.<br></p>
<p>In Berlin, you can get a square meal for 10€. A croissant, a coffee and two square meals would set you back 20€ a day. By comparison, my grocery bill is 5€ a day. That's a 450€/month difference, or 37.5 hours of your time (see above), but you'd probably spend that much time between the supermarket and the kitchen anyway.<br></p>
<p>However, getting to&nbsp;the restaurant, ordering, waiting for your food, then waiting for the bill takes time too. Personally, I&nbsp;find cooking every other day more convenient  than eating out twice a day. Eating out only makes sense when I'm too tired to cook.<br></p>
<p>This also applies to hiring professionals. You still need time to find one and to work with their schedule. I can change the oil or the brakes on my motorcycle in about 30 minutes. It takes me about as long to drop my bike off at the dealership, but I&nbsp;have to do it during office hours, and wait a few days to get it back.<br></p>
<p>In short, outsourcing your work does not always make life easier. It can lighten your mental load, but so does working less by having lower expenses.<br> </p>
<h2>Time is not a liquid asset</h2>
<p>In practice, you don't get to choose how much of your time you sell.&nbsp;If your expenses are covered, you just can't stop going to work. If you need more money, you could work more, but rarely on your own terms, just when you need to. You couldn't sell an extra 2 hours of programming on a Thursday night, because you have nothing else going on.&nbsp; There's also a limit on how much time you can sustainably sell, regardless of demand - about 60 hours a week.<br></p>
<p>You can't choose which time you sell either. Most employers will only buy your office hours. You can't decide to work night shifts, or to work 80 hour weeks in the winter, then take the summer off. You can't even decide where to allocate the time you <em>didn't</em> sell. Your employer usually decides when you take your lunch breaks, and when you can use your holidays. If you're on call, even your free time isn't quite yours.</p>
<p>In other words, you don't really trade more time at the office for less time cleaning your house. You're stuck at the office for 40 hours a week regardless, so you're just using some of your fixed budget. However, if you <em>don't</em> hire a cleaning person, and you don't spend your money, then you can buy some&nbsp;of your time back later, either as a gap year, or as an early retirement.</p>
<p>As a freelancer, you have much more control over what time you sell, and in which amount. Nonetheless, you are still bound to standard contract lengths, to the limits of your body, and to cyclical demand in your industry. A freelance accountant likely won't take time off during tax season. A freelance developer will mostly find 3 to 6 month contracts.<br></p>
<p>Put shortly, time is not a liquid asset. You can't easily  sell more or less of it according to your needs.</p>
<h2>Time does not have a fixed value</h2>
<p>Let's pretend that your boss lets you work for as long as you need, whenever you need to. You could spend an extra hour at the office, and pay someone to save you an hour of cleaning.</p>
<p>I'd make that deal. Swearing at my computer brings me joy, but doing the dishes doesn't. I'd gladly trade a few hours of programming for a few hours of cleaning.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/good-time.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>My definition of a good time</figcaption></figure>
<p>After 30 hours a week, I'd start to value my time at the office a bit more. I'd rather spend that time at home, sipping a beer on my balcony with a pie in the oven, so I&nbsp;wouldn't be so keen to sell it.</p>
<p>After 50 hours, I'd be selling my time at a much higher price. There's a point where work takes a toll on your body, and seeps into other aspects of your life.&nbsp;By then, menial work feels like a release, rather than a chore.</p>
<p>Unless you&nbsp;<em>really</em> like your job, there comes a point where you'd rather do something else, even if has a lower market value than your profession.<br></p>
<h2>The hidden benefits of doing it yourself</h2>
<p>The most understated benefit of doing things yourself is the skills and the tools you acquire along the way. Your cooking gets better and more diversified with every meal you cook. Bike repairs get cheaper and easier with every attempt. Those skills stay with you, and over time, the benefits compound. You can tackle bigger and bigger projects, and the results look better and better.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/level-up.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Outsourcing, on the other hand, doesn't get better and cheaper. It either gets better and more expensive, or cheaper and worse. This ties your quality of life to a single variable: your income. Your lifestyle is much more reliant on your ability to stay employed, because it's the only thing you can do.<br></p>
<p>Beyond that, doing things yourself is immensely rewarding. Wrenching on your own motorcycle feels good. Delighting your guests with a home-cooked meal feels good. Using shelves you built yourself feels good. These are direct products of your hard work, and symbols of the control you have over your environment.</p>
<p>I'd also argue that it gives you a greater appreciation for the world you live in. It allows you to see things beyond the surface. Musicians appreciate music on a different level,
 and the same can be said for gardeners, machinists, architects and 
every other kind of enthusiast. My fledgling interest in gardening quite literally made me see the forest for the trees.<br></p>
<p>Paying someone else to do it robs you of this joy. Climbing through the career ladder provides its own rewards, but those always felt too abstract to me. If I  indirectly make my company a little leaner, I&nbsp;get 4% more disposable income. Big whoop.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Some tasks don't develop useful skills. They don't get easier, cheaper or more enjoyable with time. Chores are chores, and some work is just plain tedious. No matter how good I&nbsp;get at painting walls, I still hate it with a passion.&nbsp;My father fixed cars his entire life, and he won't change his oil in the winter, when the car is caked in&nbsp;slush.</p>
<p>Life is short, and the 40 hour work week isn't going anywhere, so it's okay to spare your free time for things you enjoy. That's worth paying a premium for.</p>
<p>Even if you enjoy doing something, the timing isn't always right.&nbsp;I found that my motorcycle's front rim was bent just before leaving for a 3 month trip. I already had a lot on my plate with work and trip preparations, so I paid a mechanic to do it. Outsourcing lets you solve multiple problems in parallel.</p>
<p>In some cases, the upfront cost of doing things yourself is just too high. I won't resurface my motorcycle's cylinder head at home, because the tools cost more than my net worth, and highly trained machinists will do it for 100€.&nbsp;Sometimes, it's better to let economies of scale do their thing.</p>
<p>In other cases, the running costs are too high. All those things you maintain will chip away at your free time. In aggregate, they can swallow your evenings. For example, think twice about running your own server to save a few euros per month. These needy buggers tend to require your attention at the most inopportune times. Outsourcing means someone else is taking care of it, and invoicing you once a month.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the risk isn't worth the potential savings. It's important to learn how to do things yourself, but don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't cause hundreds of euros worth of damage to save a few euros. Hire a professional, and let them do their job.&nbsp;If they cock up, <em>they</em> are liable to fix the mess, not you.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, outsourcing has its time and place, but it's more expensive than it appears. Sometimes, it's better to do things yourself, and acquire useful skills …</p></article></div></div></div>

  </p>

  <p>
    In software development, communicating productively is as important as
    writing quality code quickly. Maybe even more important - studies show that
    most problems in software projects are in fact communication problems.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="why-focus-on-communication">
    <a href="#why-focus-on-communication">Why focus on communication?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    On the Internet, you can find many articles and studies about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+software+projects+fail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      why software projects fail
    </a>. They cite different reasons, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lack of understanding of business needs;</li>
    <li>Vague or poorly communicated requirements;</li>
    <li>Unrealistic timelines or expectations;</li>
    <li>False belief that scope can be defined upfront;</li>
    <li>Inadequate planning;</li>
    <li>Too many or too few people assigned to a project;</li>
    <li>Poor reporting of project status;</li>
    <li>Unmanaged risks;</li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you look closer, you'll notice that these reasons point to one thing in
    common: a disconnect between management and developers. So removing this
    disconnect should yield great returns.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">
    <a href="#does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">Does it mean we should talk more?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What would improve communication between developers and management? This is
    a broad topic, but one idea's obvious: they must communicate frequently
    enough to be on the same page about goals, requirements, priorities, work
    progress, project challenges, and risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates another problem though: to be productive, developers need
    prolonged periods of quiet time. They need to do focused work, without
    distractions. Meetings distract developers from writing code. And waiting
    for the meeting can be even worse. If people know they'll be interrupted
    soon, they'll feel discouraged from starting anything big. Paul Graham
    wrote a great article about this -
    <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so on one hand we need to talk to developers, but on the other we
    shouldn't distract them so much that they can't be productive. Finding this
    delicate balance may be hard, but we can make the job easier by removing
    trivial questions from the discussion. Below I'll give some examples of how
    well organized processes and technology can help us talk less, but do more.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">
    <a href="#stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">Stop asking who's working on what</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    One such trivial question is “Who's working on what?” Isn't that what the
    task tracker's for? All task trackers incorporate concepts like Assignee
    and Status. When tasks are accurately assigned with up-to-date statuses,
    you'll have immediate visibility about who's working on what and how long
    they've been working on it. Besides that, you may occasionally need to
    return to old completed tasks. Having an accurate task history helps you
    return easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though task tracking sounds simple, in practice it requires a manager's
    effort to keep your task tracker in good shape. People may forget to switch
    task statuses, or assign tasks to themselves. Someone might not have a task
    in progress at all. Someone else might have multiple tasks in progress,
    which once again, doesn't tell us what exactly they're working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created these "In progress"
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/notification-types/">notifications</a>
    in Teamplify:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="No issues in progress" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.png?3488 2x" width="494" height="106">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Teamplify connects to your task tracker, like Jira or Trello. If it's not
    clear what developers are working on, it will politely ask, in Slack or
    over email, to update their task status. These notifications are smart and
    unobtrusive. They also take all kinds of non-working days into
    consideration, so they won't disturb your teammates on their vacation.
    More on that later.
  </p>

  </h2>


  <p>
    Today, almost every development team uses at least some version of these
    collaboration tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>code hosting - for example, GitHub or GitLab;</li>
    <li>task tracker - Jira, Trello, or similar;</li>
    <li>chat - many teams use Slack;</li>
    <li>video conferencing software, such as Zoom.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tools are usually shared with the whole team, so any team member can
    take a look and learn something about work progress. Unfortunately,
    looking over each tool is not a convenient way to learn what the team has
    been busy on. Because the information is fragmented, not everyone will be
    willing to dig through it. It's much easier to ask about the status in a
    meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created the Team Calendar view, which collects all the work
    activity from your team tools and puts it in one place. It also shows
    national holidays, vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a>:
  </p>

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar displays the most important types of team work activity,
    including code commits, task updates, and communication over video and chat.
    It also automatically detects when someone mentions a task in chat messages
    and code commits. For example, if a task was discussed somewhere in Slack,
    you'll see it, and be able to click directly to that discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Better visibility into work progress means better informed managers, with
    less need for meetings and less developer distractions.
  </p>

  </h2>


  <p>
    Time off plays an important role in short-term project planning. Even in
    small organizations, people don't always remember who's going on vacation
    next week. And if your team is distributed, it's quite easy to forget about
    other country's national holidays.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone's absence is a surprise, it's not good for your project.
    Making time-off clearly visible helps people better plan around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we added time-off management to Teamplify. National holidays,
    vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a> are visible on the
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Team Calendar</a> mentioned above.
    You can also configure notifications for Slack or email:
  </p>

  <p>

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if people miss the notification and mention someone who is absent
    today, Teamplify will politely remind them:
  </p>

  <p>

      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also request a vacation or add another status via the Teamplify
    Slack bot, so you can manage off time without leaving Slack.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="identify-stuck-progress">
    <a href="#identify-stuck-progress">Identify stuck progress</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Even the best and brightest developers get stuck sometimes. There may be an
    unexpected technical problem, or maybe the task turns out to be more
    difficult than previously thought. In such cases, brainstorming with
    colleagues may help find a solution or an alternative path and boost the
    progress significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we haven't seen any code activity from a developer in a while, it
    doesn't necessarily mean that they're stuck, but it might signal a good
    time to check if everything's alright.
  </p>

  <p>

    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stuck communication is just another form of stuck progress. This could be a
    lengthy discussion without any productive decision. More often, it's just a
    question that's been waiting too long for an answer:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="Pending questions notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.png?3488 2x" width="666" height="154">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bot can politely remind your correspondent about your pending
    question, it means you don't have to. Besides that, bot notifications are
    sometimes better perceived. If a person reminds you every day about pending
    questions, it might be annoying. But if a bot does the same - it's probably
    okay, because, you know, it's just a bot.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="bottom-line">
    <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom line</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    When communication improvements add up, the result is a more productive
    work environment, where people are better informed and spend less time on
    discussing trivial questions. We have a lot of complex problems to solve,
    let's focus on them instead.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><main><article role="article"><div><p>In a previous life, I was an electronic music designer working on Broadway shows in New York City. Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

Of the popular social media platforms, Twitter stands out in its usefulness in different facets of higher education, including teaching, receiving the latest updates in a field of study, increasing academic citations, and sharing opinions on current events.</p><p>For China scholars in particular, Twitter offers the opportunity to communicate with a diverse spectrum of sources of specialist and generalist knowledge of China, including certain intellectuals and activists based in mainland China (who override the censorship placed on Twitter), besides Chinese media like Xinhua and People’s Daily and Western media covering China issues. Academic journals like The China Quarterly, as well as relevant academic departments and institutes, also have a presence on Twitter. Moreover, upwards of 300 China studies scholars, spanning all fields and career stages, are active on Twitter (Sullivan, 2016).</p><p>In an interesting <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/china-scholars-and-twitter/0B265DA8C8E2C7581A5179F43B973379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a>, Jonathan Sullivan of the University of Nottingham systematically examined how China scholars are adopting Twitter for a number of professional reasons like networking with other researchers in their field of work, increasing research visibility, staying up-to-date on developments in their study domain, and building an online presence for themselves. He uncovered some valuable takeaways in the process, which will be discussed in this article.</p></div></div><div><p><h4><strong>China scholars’ use and views of Twitter</strong></h4></p></div><div><div><p>In his study, Sullivan surveyed the experiences and perceptions of a fraction of China scholars who use Twitter. Half of the respondents of the survey reported using Twitter for more than two years, and 15% had less than a year’s experience. <strong>Nearly 44% reported using Twitter for up to an hour every day</strong>. Most of the scholars stated that they use Twitter to collect information and stay abreast of current events. About 75% scholars said they share links and related materials, publicize their own activities, and connect with other China scholars. Two-thirds revealed they use Twitter to connect with China-focused professionals in other sectors. Over half the respondents stated that Twitter had helped them become much better informed. While 42% of the surveyed scholars felt that Twitter had helped them expand their academic and professional networks considerably, 40% thought it had not added value to their academic reputations at all.</p><p>Several respondents agreed that Twitter widened information access and exposed them to new ideas and teaching materials. Positive effects reported by some scholars included achieving a wider network than would be possible in the physical world, the conception of novel ideas for research, and staying up to date with the latest developments in their field. A few negative points noted by the respondents about Twitter use were distraction, reduced productivity, and information overload.</p><p>The conflict between the “rapid-response Twitter commentary” versus the traditionally slow pace of scholarly practice was also voiced by certain respondents. Some scholars stated that their peers perceived Twitter as a waste of time or a platform for blatant self-promotion. Many respondents expressed apprehensions and reluctance to openly discuss sensitive issues about China because of possible repercussions on their access to the country or collaborators residing therein.</p></div></div><div><p><h4><strong>Why should Early Career Researchers (ECRs) use Twitter in 2020?</strong></h4></p></div><div><div><p>Twitter offers real-time interaction, a sense of closeness, and short response times. In addition, discoverability, enabled by the use of hashtags, makes it easy to rapidly find and share content and increase visibility. The informal nature of communication helps soften communication barriers with senior researchers, whom junior scholars might otherwise be hesitant to reach out to in person. Another key feature of Twitter is the use of multiple captivating content formats like infographics and videos, which attract interest and hold public attention, as well as interactive features like polls, which engage audiences actively.</p><p>Promoting one’s research on Twitter <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been</a> found to positively correlate with higher citation counts. According to one study, articles tweeted about received thrice as many citations as those that were not tweeted about. In his article, Sullivan cites several studies highlighting Twitter as an alternative measure of research impact and professional competence. Metrics based on social media forums like Twitter provide new ways to evaluate the significance and reach of a research output, complementing traditional citation metrics. Quantifying activity such as retweets and mentions of scholarly articles might help build a more complete picture of a researcher’s work and social influence.</p></div></div><div><p>Twitter also makes it easy to have intra-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary exchanges with scholars. In addition, Twitter is being used to comment upon academic practices and culture, seek and share advice, deliberate on teaching practices, and discuss and debate issues in real time. <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/07/26/a-to-z-of-social-media-for-academia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some</a> scholars go as far as saying that opting out of social media can be equated with opting out of email in the 1990s.</p></div><div><p><h4><strong>How can China scholars benefit from Twitter?</strong></h4></p></div><div><p>Some tips to engage productively on Twitter include sharing interesting articles and book reviews related to topical issues and participating in Twitter discussions with relevant hashtags, e.g., #PhDChat or #AcademicTwitter. Using and following hashtags like #ChinaStudies and #ChinaScholars would be a useful way to identify other researchers from the field and forge academically meaningful connections. China scholars may have expertise in niche areas, and by creating and promoting their distinct profiles (“branding,” so to speak), they can harness Twitter’s potential for boosting visibility and recognition.</p></div><div><div><blockquote><p><strong>The Story of Tricia Kehoe</strong></p><p><em>An interesting story that reinforces the importance of China scholars to utilize Twitter is that of Tricia Kehoe, Sullivan’s student, whose area of interest is Tibetan studies. Kehoe chanced upon a second-hand copy of an obscure book, titled Sue in Tibet. Intrigued by what appeared to be the first piece of Western children’s literature set in Tibet, she posted a picture of the book on Twitter. Almost instantly, she was contacted by Samanthi Dissanayake, the Asia editor for the BBC News website, regarding the possibility of an article based on the book. Thus began Kehoe’s quest into the life and background of the book’s author, Dorris Shelton Still, with Twitter playing a huge role in locating Dorris’s family and gleaning insights into her life and experiences in Tibet. The accidental discovery of an American woman’s perspectives of life in Tibet in the early 1900s and the wise decision of sharing it on Twitter sparked interest in the right places. Kehoe ended up being interviewed on BBC’s Newshour, and the story also featured in a series by The New York Times, thanks to the “<span><a href="https://jonlsullivan.com/tag/china-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the engine of creativity that is Twitter</a></span>,” tweeted Dissanayake. This media exposure was a bonus for Kehoe, who unwittingly displayed her ability to engage audiences beyond her field of study, all the way to the general public.</em></p><p><em>Tweeting is an excellent way to demonstrate engagement with current affairs and reach out to journalists for promotion and garnering public attention. Sometimes, as in Kehoe’s case, journalists may contact a researcher upon spotting a social media post with potential for an interesting story. In fact, Sullivan notes that by trawling Twitter, China correspondents often identify scholars to interview. Media pieces resulting from these interactions can help establish useful connections and build professional reputation. Journalists even <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24742163?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>advise</span></a> China scholars to use Twitter in order to increase their online presence and media impact. Like the rediscovery of Sue in Tibet, many more stories remain to be unraveled, shared, and discussed widely.</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p><h4><strong>Constraints faced by China Scholars</strong></h4></p></div><div><div><p>Some scholars felt that their superiors did not consider Twitter use favorable in the study environment.</p><p>While many China scholars would be interested to take part in open discussions related to their field of study, most express inhibitions to do so. Access to domestic social media platforms such as Sina Weibo is an option for scholars residing in China, these sites are heavily monitored, preventing unrestricted and uncensored exchange of information.</p><p>Another constraint faced by Twitter users in general is the 280-character limit for a tweet. This forces scholars to distil their findings into a pithy and more accessible format. Therefore, expressing results as concisely as possible is a skill that early career scholars need to fine-tune.</p><p>Using social media as an academic increases opportunities for collaboration and engagement, and several Western universities now place considerable emphasis on impact and engagement in higher education. However, ECRs are not typically trained to build this ability. Thus, experience and skill in optimizing Twitter use are focus areas for young scholars.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Besides research, teaching, and administration, competence in handling digital media is increasingly being encouraged by institutions. Twitter has been found to benefit China scholars hoping to expand their external engagement profile, particularly by opening possibilities for media engagement.</p><p>China scholars who are social media savvy will be at an advantage in the competitive job market. In fact, as demonstrated by the story of Tricia Kehoe, China scholars can benefit tremendously from such active and sustained networking with various stakeholders.</p></div></div><div><div><blockquote><p><em>In 2020, researchers are now …</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div>

<p>It’s Christmastime again! Shall we talk about trees? This post is about my new
holiday hobby: hallucinating tree-shaped fractals using our old friend,
gradient descent.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/tree-building.gif" alt="Christmas tree"></p>
<hr>
<p>But — let me start at the beginning. For a variety of reasons, the cover
image of Douglas Hofstadter’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"><em>I am a Strange
Loop</em></a> has been on my mind
this month. I have been thinking a lot about this wonderful image created by
pointing a camera at a projector that displays what the camera is seeing. In
modern terms: what happens if you screen-share the screen sharing window? This
happens:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/strange-loop.png" alt="from the cover of the book"></p>
<p>Such “feedback loop” recursions often rapidly converge to breathtaking
fixed-points. The NYC MoMath even has an <a href="https://momath.org/25-feedback-fractals-1/">art
installation</a> that lets you play
with a camera-and-projector setup to make <a href="https://twitter.com/momath1/status/824740594564075520">wonderful
patterns</a>.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there is a mathematical theory here. At risk of ruining the
mystery, I will tell you about it, though without writing any equations. :-)
The theory is the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system">Iterated Function
Systems</a>, which is
almost exactly what it sounds like. Start with a set of affine functions
(affine because that’s what camera-projector-systems do) and repeatedly apply
them to a set of points, taking the union at each step. Regardless of where you
start, you will soon end up with a fractal structure which is the fixed point
of the system. Why fractal? —because the self-similarity comes from the
infinitely-nested composition of the affine functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Ifs-construction.png" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<p>There are theorems that ensure convergence towards and uniqueness of this fixed
point in the limit, but… it’s believable enough, don’t you think? Following
your intuition, you can build Sierpinski Triangles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern">Barnsley
Ferns</a> and all sorts of other
beautiful structures using an IFS. I refer you to Section 8.2 of <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop"><em>The
Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</em> by Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer (yes, <em>that</em>
Lindenmayer)</a> for more botanical
connections.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Fractal_fern_explained.png" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now here is the question that has been on my mind: if I give you a picture of a
fractal-fern, can you give me a set of affine functions whose fixed point is
that fern? This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system#The_inverse_problem"><em>inverse
problem</em></a>
for IFSes. According to Wikipedia, this problem has real-world applications in
image compression, but it is <em>hard</em> to do in general.</p>
<p>Hmm. Interesting. Can our favorite tool, gradient descent, come to the rescue?
At least in an approximate sense? Recall that a two-dimensional affine function
is really just a 3x3 matrix (with 6 free parameters) that encodes the details
of the transformation. If we could easily compute images of IFS fixed points
from a set of matrices, then perhaps we could try to optimize the parameters of
these matrices to make the fixed point look the way we want it to.</p>
<p>The challenge, of course, is efficiently <em>finding</em> the fixed point —
repeatedly rasterizing and compositing affine transformations on images sounds
expensive — and doing so differentiably sounds like a scalability nightmare!
But there is a wonderful solution to this problem, which is to play the
so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">chaos game</a>.” Instead of
<em>densely</em> applying all the functions to all the points on the plane, you can
<em>sparsely</em> approximate the fixed point as follows: Start with a point — any
point! — and <em>randomly</em> select one of the affine functions of the IFS and
apply it to the point. Repeat this process with the new point. It turns out
that in the limit, the “trail” left behind by this wandering point converges to
the fixed point of the IFS. (This, too, is a theorem, but again I think it is
believable enough that I will not demand a proof.) This is what the “chaos
game” looks like for the Sierpinski triangle; notice how the salt-and-pepper
spattering of points soon converges boldly into the fractal we know and love
(it’s an animation — stare for a few seconds).</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Sierpinski_chaos_animated.gif" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<p>So here is the plan: we start with a point, and play the chaos game with our
current IFS matrices to obtain a <em>point cloud</em> that stochastically approximates
the fixed-point. Then, we compare this <em>point cloud</em> to our target fern-image
to obtain a “loss.” Finally, we update our IFS matrix parameters to minimize
this loss, until at last the fixed-point converges to the target image. It’s
just “machine learning,” really: we’re learning to play the chaos game!</p>
<p>Here is an outline of the algorithm (with some details elided):</p>
<pre><code># initialize IFS
F = [random_3x3_affine() for _ in range(4)]
o = torch.optim.Adam(F, lr=0.0001)

for step in range(100_000):
    o.zero_grad()
    # start at origin
    v = torch.tensor([0., 0., 1.])

    # play the chaos game once
    trace = []
    for _ in range(200):
          # applying an affine function is just
        # a matrix multiplication!
        v = torch.matmul(random.choice(F), v)
        trace.append(v)

    # treat the trace as a point cloud
    loss = compare(target_image, trace)

    # update parameters
    loss.backward()
    o.step()
</code></pre>
<p>Ah! Actually, there is <em>one</em> detail that I <em>should</em> explain: how do you compare
a point cloud and an image? My idea is to convert the target image to a
<em>second</em> point cloud by uniformly sampling points from it, for example by
rejection-sampling. Then you can compare the two point clouds by the so-called
“chamfer distance,” which is the mean distance from each point to its nearest
neighbor in the opposite point cloud. This is quadratic-time to compute, and
the most expensive part of the whole operation, but with ~100 points in each
set it is quite doable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pedagogical aside: notice that the “trick” here is really a <em>change in
representation.</em> This optimization problem is easier to solve on point clouds
than on raster images! An important lesson, that applies across the
ML-for-graphics domain… and more broadly to all differentiable programming
enterprises.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Remarkably, this zany scheme works quite well! Let’s try it with a heart. (A
heart, because it’s an easy low-entropy shape, but also because it felt
symbolically appropriate in relation to Hofstadter’s broader philosophical
project of souls-within-souls-within-souls.)</p>
<p>When we initialize the system with 4 random affine transformations, the trail
left behind by the chaos game is very unimpressive. The sparsity is because I
simulate only 200 steps of the chaos game for each step of gradient descent —
there’s a tradeoff between noise and computation time, of course, as there is
with any form of SGD.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-samples-early.png" alt="chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Okay. Time to optimize! Here is what it looks like after 100K steps of
optimization with an Adam optimizer (that’s about 40 minutes of wall-time
computation on my old MacBook). It looks pretty good, don’t you think? The
chamfer distance scheme works!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-samples.png" alt="chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Now we can export the four affine matrices out from PyTorch and work out the
“true” fixed point with a more expensive offline computation (for example, by
simulating a few <em>million</em> steps of the chaos game). It looks like this — not
perfect, and indeed quite crayon-scribble-ey, but clearly <em>something</em>
interesting has happened, and the result is convincingly heartlike.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-fractal.png" alt="extended chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Where is the fractal structure hidden in this heart? This needs some
vizualization tooling to see clearly. After a bit of JS-canvas-hacking: here is
a GIF of the heart that reveals its fixed-point structure.
Hearts-in-hearts-in-hearts!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart.gif" alt="Heart"></p>
<p>I will admit to blinking a few times when I first saw this animation play out
in full — I did <em>not</em> expect it to work, and even now I find myself marveling
at this creation? discovery? of a heart encoded in 24 numbers.</p>
<hr>
<p>But it still doesn’t look <em>quite right</em> — the fractalness isn’t <em>obvious</em>.
How come? It’s because our affine transformations stretch and squash the heart
into almost unrecognizable blobs. A final, natural improvement is to force our
affine transformations to be <em>rigid</em>, so that there isn’t any squishing or
skewing in the fractal. This is actually not too bad to implement: the solution
to problems of constraint are typically reparametrizations, and indeed in this
case we can simply reparametrize the matrices in terms of a rotation, an
(isotropic) scale, and a translation. Now we’re down from 6 parameters per
matrix to just 4 — even more magical! The result is a much more “obviously”
fractal-ey fixed point, simply because your eye can more easily pick out the
structural recursion when it is made of rigid motions.</p>
<p>Let’s take it for a — pardon — <em>spin!</em></p>
<p>Since I promised you trees, here is some fractal foliage. The target image was
a picture of a maple leaf! I’d never thought about this before, but indeed a
maple leaf contains within it an echo of the whole tree. (Full disclosure: it
takes a couple of randomized restarts to get a really impressive result — the
low dimensionality of the fractal’s parametrization leads to the same
stuck-in-a-local-optimum woes that differentiable rendering folks face all the
time…)</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/foliage.gif" alt="Leaf"></p>
<p>This one uses just three matrices — experimentally, three matrices tend to be
enough to get really good results, and more just lead to very busy and crowded
fractals. (I don’t know if there is a word for number-of-maps–in-an-IFS, but
let’s call it the IFS’s <em>arity</em>. In this terminology, I like <em>ternary</em> IFSes.)</p>
<p>And finally, since I promised you Christmas trees…</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/christmas-tree.gif" alt="Christmas tree"></p>
<p>This last animation is actually absolutely <em>baffling</em> to me. In part, this is
because of how <em>treelike</em> the fractal turned out — here it is overlayed
against the silhouette I optimized against. Can you imagine this is encoded by
just 12 parameters? Odd.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/christmas-tree-match.png" alt="Tree vs. silhouette"></p>
<p>But even more bafflingly: the actual geometry of the recursion is <em>nothing</em>
like the tree recursion geometry you and I are used to from CS106! Compare the
GIF above to Barnsley’s Fern: while Barnsley turns each full leaf into two
smaller leaves with “semantic” affine maps, this Christmas tree does all sorts
of <em>bizarre</em> uninterpretable cartwheels and somehow almost magically works
itself out in the end. It is mesmerizing to me, …</p></section></article></div>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs.

<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

      <p>This is inspired by the post <a href="https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/">100 Tips for a Better Life by Conor Barnes</a>. I recommend you go read that if you haven’t.</p>

<p>Almost none of this will be new to you, but there is value in reminding yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn about things that you are curious about. Seems obvious, but put effort into it.</li>
<li>When you find a book that seems interesting, add it to a list. I use the Audible wish list. For regular books I just buy them on Ebay or Amazon.</li>
<li>If you have a task that takes less than 10 minutes, just do it now.</li>
<li>Keep a list of reminders. I like to set them so they notify me at weekly or monthly intervals.</li>
<li>Don’t take any small excuse as a sign not to work out. If you skip one day, definitely don’t skip the next.</li>
<li>Ordering yourself fun little toys on Ebay that take weeks to arrive is very fun.</li>
<li>Setting up a home desk with good equipment is well worth the cost. Your monitor, chair, keyboard and mouse should be good.</li>
<li>If I start gaming, I don’t sleep enough.</li>
<li>Businesses are hard to start. Try to test an idea before building the whole thing.</li>
<li>Go on walks.</li>
<li>Give away things you don’t really like.</li>
<li>Gigabit internet is not worth it. You won’t notice the difference between that and 300-500 Mbps. Save yourself the money.</li>
<li>Have a computer you really like to use, opting for a chromebook leads to much less productivity.</li>
<li>The point of creating an audience is to get feedback. Twitter or karma are not meaningless.</li>
<li>You won’t get an opposing opinion if you don’t seek it out.</li>
<li>Make sure the thing you are buying doesn’t charge via micro-usb.</li>
<li>Do small programming projects. It will help you learn and it’s a great creative outlet.</li>
<li>People who are good writers or speakers have put a lot of effort into it.</li>
<li>Life is unpredictable, make sure you spend it with people you love.</li>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>21 Nov 2020</span></p><hr>
  <p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://modpizza.com/we-are-mod/">MOD Pizza</a>, they are a restaurant chain across the US and Canada, who specialize in quickly-served, made-to-order pizza. You get to pick anywhere between zero to all of their available toppings at flat rates, a bit like sandwiches at Subway.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I saw an advert for MOD Pizza on the side of a Seattle public transit bus. I wish I had taken a picture so that I wouldn’t have to go by memory, but I remember it claiming something along the lines of “thousands of possible combinations”. I remember thinking, “gee, it has to be a lot more than thousands” and that they must be intentionally undercounting them because millions or billions would sound too ridiculous to the general passerby.</p>

<p>I figured I’d double check their math.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>To familiarize yourself with the problem domain, I’d recommend checking out <a href="https://modpizza.com/menu/">their menu</a> with your own eyes.</p>

<p>One limitation that we’re dealing with here is that this post may not end up being very evergreen. I don’t know how frequently MOD changes up its menu offerings. I’ve definitely come across some limited run and “limited locations” toppings during the course of my research. If you’re reading this years from publishing, you may need to treat this post as a time capsule.</p>

<h2 id="the-assumptions">The Assumptions</h2>

<p>It’s complicated. When anything can go on a pizza, what one may consider a “reasonable” pizza is highly subjective.</p>

<p>I am sourcing my information from two official lists on MOD’s website:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://modpizza.com/menu/">menu page</a> on their website</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://modpizza.com/nutrition/">nutrition page</a> on their website (this one looks more comprehensive)</li>
</ol>

<p>For the purposes of this calculation, I am going to ignore:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Limited run toppings</li>
  <li>Toppings available in “limited locations”</li>
  <li>All non-pizza offerings - dessert, drinks, even their very customizable salads</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, some of the ingredients in the list are what I consider <em>somewhat</em> redundant.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Garlic - chopped vs roasted</li>
  <li>Red peppers - “mama lil’s sweet hot peppas” vs roasted</li>
  <li>Sea salt - on its own vs salt + pepper combo</li>
  <li>Romaine lettuce - on its own vs included in spring mix</li>
  <li>Tomatoes - diced vs sliced</li>
</ol>

<p>However, it would be perfectly reasonable to ask for a pizza that includes both versions of all of these. So it’s only fair to calculate a low and high end for the final count, with and without these “redundant” ingredients.</p>

<p>Now this might be a bit more subjective, but I am not going to count the following as valid pizzas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Crust with no toppings whatsoever</li>
  <li>Crust with sauce only</li>
</ol>

<p>Searching the web a little bit tells me some people do enjoy cheese pizza without any sauce, so I hereby consider that a valid pizza.</p>

<p>To deal with these edge cases, I will subtract exactly two pizzas (per crust type) from the high and low estimates.</p>

<p>I wonder how frequently MOD gets customers that request the poor employees to construct them a monstrosity of a pizza containing a mountain of all possible toppings. I prefer not to think about such things.</p>

<h2 id="counting-the-ingredients">Counting The Ingredients</h2>

<h3 id="crust">Crust</h3>

<p>MOD offers 3 crust “styles”, so to speak - 11-inch, 6-inch, and a thicker 11-inch “mega dough”. <em>But</em>, if you pick the 11-inch option in their online configurator, they also offer gluten-free and cauliflower variants in that size. I recognize that 6-inch and “mega dough” creations could be thought of as very different pizza experiences. At the same time, they could be considered the same as the base variant. Let’s go with a range for this one.</p>

<p><strong>Total options: 3 to 5</strong><br>
<strong>Allowed to skip: No</strong></p>

<p>This category is a special one, in that there <em>must</em> be one and only one crust per pizza. I am not open to debate on this.</p>

<h3 id="sauce">Sauce</h3>

<p>MOD offers 7 sauce options, which includes a “garlic rub” and olive oil options. While I think it’d be a travesty, I consider it reasonable to ask for a sauce-less pizza as well.</p>

<p><strong>Total options: 7</strong><br>
<strong>Allowed to skip: Yes</strong></p>

<h3 id="cheese">Cheese</h3>

<p>MOD offers 7 cheese options, including a dairy-free option. Some of the cheese options, such as feta, are not ones I would consider standard “pizza cheese” (like mozzarella), but more appropriate as topping cheese on top of standard shredded cheese. But hey, anything goes here.</p>

<p>I am going into this with an especially open mind, and will consider it reasonable to ask for a pizza without any cheese.</p>

<p>Is a sauce-less <em>and</em> cheese-less pizza… still pizza?</p>

<p><strong>Total options: 7</strong><br>
<strong>Allowed to skip: Yes</strong></p>

<h3 id="meat">Meat</h3>

<p>Skipping over two limited-availability options, MOD offers 9 meat options. As a vegetarian, I am very familiar with meat-less pizzas!</p>

<p><strong>Total options: 9</strong><br>
<strong>Allowed to skip: Yes</strong></p>

<h3 id="veggies--good-stuff">Veggies &amp; Good Stuff</h3>

<p>Yep, that’s what MOD calls this category. Evidently, the “good stuff” includes herbs and spices. This is also the largest category on MOD’s menu. I had to skip over five limited-availability options in MOD’s nutrition information sheet. Even after ignoring these, there were two extra items listed on the nutrition page that were missing from the menu. I included these in the count.</p>

<p>As mentioned in an earlier section, this category also has several (what I consider) redundant options, giving us a range.</p>

<p>Of course, we also need to account for pizzas with no veggie toppings.</p>

<p><strong>Total options: 22 to 27</strong><br>
<strong>Allowed to skip: Yes</strong></p>

<h3 id="finishing-sauces">Finishing Sauces</h3>

<p>These are fairly straightforward. There are 8 finishing sauce options, which even includes a “Mike’s Hot Honey”, which I find a bit strange. But then some people find pineapple on pizza strange. Of course, you can omit this category of toppings quite orthodoxically.</p>

<p><strong>Total options: 8</strong><br>
<strong>Allowed to skip: Yes</strong></p>

<h2 id="munching-the-numbers">Munching The Numbers</h2>

<p>Time to bust out combinatorics! This problem can be mapped to counting the number of subsets in a set. Here, the sets would be each category of toppings.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_k-combinations_for_all_k">formula for that</a> is <em>2<sup>n</sup></em>, where <em>n</em> is the number of items in the set, or <em>2<sup>n</sup> - 1</em> if we prefer to include the empty set. For all but the crust category, we do.</p>

<p>After collecting all the lower-bound ingredient counts, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 crusts (can pick exactly 1)</li>
  <li>7 sauces</li>
  <li>7 cheeses</li>
  <li>9 meats</li>
  <li>22 veggies &amp; good stuff</li>
  <li>8 finishing sauces</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, after compiling all the higher-bound ingredient counts, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 crusts (can pick exactly 1)</li>
  <li>7 sauces</li>
  <li>7 cheeses</li>
  <li>9 meats</li>
  <li>27 veggies &amp; good stuff</li>
  <li>8 finishing sauces</li>
</ul>

<p>As noted in the section, The Assumptions, I want to avoid exactly two edge cases as invalid pizzas (no toppings, sauce only), so I will subtract those from the final counts.</p>

<p><strong>Lowball estimate:</strong> 3 × ((2<sup>7</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>7</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>9</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>22</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>8</sup> - 1) - 2)<br>
<strong>Total:</strong> 26,445,365,774,404,599</p>

<p><strong>Highball estimate:</strong> 5 × ((2<sup>7</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>7</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>9</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>27</sup> - 1) × (2<sup>8</sup> - 1) - 2)<br>
<strong>Total:</strong> 1,410,419,833,730,094,065</p>

<p>You can request somewhere between <strong>26 quadrillion 445 trillion 365 billion 774 million 404 thousand 599</strong> and <strong>1 quintillion 410 quadrillion 419 trillion 833 billion 730 million 94 thousand 65</strong> distinct and valid pizza recipes at MOD Pizza as of the time of this writing.</p>

<p>I really hope I got it right because this is on the Internet now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                                <p>Even a few minutes of research into the best journals and notebooks will yield a recommendation for the Traveler’s Notebook. The universal love of this notebook system makes it clear that this is one of the most unique stationery products sold today as well as being one of the one’s people are simply obsessed with.</p>
<p>So, what’s the deal with the Traveler’s Notebook?</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMxJPZN5hqE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Background">Traveler’s Notebook Background</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is made by the Traveler’s Company. This company is based in the&nbsp;Nakameguro section of Tokyo, Japan but the notebooks are sold all over the place, from an official company store at the Narita Airport (also in Tokyo) to paper stores all over the world. The notebooks and accessories are also sold many places online, including <a href="https://amzn.to/3gVgJAB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, and nearly ever premium stationery retailer.</p>
<p>The notebook might seem like something that has been made for dozens of years — a wonderful throwback to the pre-computer era — but that’s not the case. The standard Traveler’s notebook has been sold since 2006 and the smaller passport size first went on sale in 2010. The company that makes the Traveler’s notebook was original called Midori, but the name was changed to the “Traveler’s Company” in 2015.</p>
<p>The parent company of the Traveler’s Company as well as Midori Paper is Designphil Inc., which has been in existence since 1950 when it was formed under the name Midori Shokai Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>While officially known as the “Traveler’s Notebook” most people refer to the notebook as the “Travelers notebook,” dropping the possessive which seems unnecessary and counter-intuitive.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Basics">Traveler’s Notebook Basics</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is a notebook system, which is to say that there is no canonical “Traveler’s Notebook” but rather endless variations on the company’s notebook system. The basic components are a leather cover, notebook inserts, and then a range of accessories that include rubber bands, pockets, stickers and so forth.</p>
<p>The notebooks are prized for their ability to be refilled, their excellent accessories, and their ability to be incredibly customized so no two Traveler’s notebooks are alike.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Inserts">Traveler’s Notebook Inserts</span></h3>
<p>Each notebook is composed of a leather cover and then inserts. These insert components include:</p>
<ul><li>Covers</li>
<li>Refills</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
</ul><p>We’ll dig into each type in a bit.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Sizes">Traveler’s Notebook Sizes</span></h3>
<p>The notebooks are sold in two sizes: Regular and Passport. It’s critical to know what cover you have so that you buy the right inserts to fit it. The two sizes are different and are not cross compatible.</p>
<p>The only real difference between the two sizes are their dimensions. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 12.0 x 22.0 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>: 9.8 x 13.4 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
</ul><p>The paper that each notebook uses is different as well. Traveler’s notebook paper has the following dimensions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 11.0 x 21.0 x 0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>:&nbsp;8.9 x 12.4 x&nbsp;0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
</ul><p>The notebooks do not adhere to <a href="https://unsharpen.com/paper-sizes/">standard paper sizes</a>. The closest standard sizes would be B6 for the Regular and B7 for Passport.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Covers">Traveler’s Notebook Covers</span></h2>
<p>The outside of a Traveler’s notebook is a single layer leather cover that is smooth on the outside and suede on the inside. It’s sold in black, brown, dark blue, and a reddish brown, known as “Camel.” The covers are made of a fine leather and they age wonderful, even if you are not particularly careful with them.</p>
<p>The covers lie nearly flat when open and have no branding on them. The main features on the cover are an elastic band that hold it shut and one that holds the inserts in place.</p>
<p>Each leather cover ships in a linen bag that protects it when en route to its own. The cover is prized by buyers but doesn’t have a purpose outside of presentation.</p>
<p>The leather covers are made in Thailand while all the paper is made in Japan.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Refills">Traveler’s Notebook Refills</span></h2>
<p>The refills are the beating heart of the notebook — they are the paper that goes inside. The refills come in Regular and Passport size, just like the covers and use excellent quality Midori paper, which is a major selling point, especially for fountain pen users. The paper does come in a number of varieties.</p>
<p>For the Regular size notebooks these include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong> Lightweight (Tomoe River), Sketch, Craft, Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong> Daily, Weekly, Weekly Vertical, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>For Passport the selection is a bit more limited:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong>&nbsp;Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong>&nbsp;Weekly, Weekly Mid-Year Start, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>While the notebooks are not a standard size, competing companies do make compatible notebooks. Some of the top options for these non-Traveler’s refills are Yamamoto with their Ro-Biki refills and Raymay’a A5 Slim refills.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Storage_Options">Traveler’s Notebook Storage Options</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s notebooks are small but mighty, partly because they have options for holding more than just your ideas.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2OdwuGH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Card File</a> is a bit outdated in the era of the iPhone, but it’s use for storing business cards. There is also a Craft Paper Card File that will store more cards than the standard model, or can be used for assorted scraps of paper, stickers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Double-sided stickers are sold to insert photographs, cut out articles, and other mementos. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3iR9knv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Film Pocket Sticker</a> is quite similar, but it’s actually a light plastic sticker that adheres to your notebook or inside a refill and then you can place a photo or piece of paper inside without damaging it. Traveler’s Pocket Stickers are similar but are angled at the top and fully open, so they can used for storing taller items. The Large Pocket Sticker can hole a full photograph or index card on its side.</p>
<p>The most robust storage options are the <a href="https://amzn.to/2W8Dau7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zipper Case</a> and Three-fold File, which can handle larger items and much more of then. The Three-fold File for the standard notebook can even hold a full-sized piece of A4 paper that has been triple-folded (like a you would do to a letter). The Zipper Case can hold ink cartridges, a small pencil sharpener, paper clips, refills or other similar items that won’t fit in a pocket.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Accessories">Traveler’s Notebook Accessories</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s Company loves their accessories… and so do Traveler’s notebook enthusiasts. Some of the accessories include:</p>
<ul><li>Pen holder</li>
<li>Additional elastic bands (known as Connecting Bands)</li>
<li>Plastic Sheet Underlay</li>
<li>Repair Kit (replacement elastic bands)</li>
<li>Refill Binder (for storing refills that are full and no longer needed in your notebook)</li>
<li>Brass charm (for accessorizing the notebook)</li>
<li>Traveler’s Company stickers</li>
</ul><h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Alternatives">Traveler’s Notebook Alternatives</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook might be a distinct thing made by a specific brand, but many other brands have recognized its success and sell similar products. After all, it’s not like the Traveler’s Company was the first to invent a leather notebook cover or to put excellent paper and handy pockets inside of a notebook, journal, folder, or folio!</p>
<p>The main choice with an alternative will be if you want a leather-covered notebook or just a customizable notebook system. Both of these are reasonable ways to define the Traveler’s system, so shop according to your desires for a leather cover, a modular notebook system, or both.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite options for alternatives are:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2ATOyma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kokuyo Jibun Techo 2020 3 in 1 Set</a></strong></li>
<li>Kokuyo Systemic cover and notebooks</li>
<li>Chic Sparrow Notebook system</li>
<li>Field Notes Everyday Inspiration Leather Cover and memo pads</li>
<li>Bellroy leather notebook cover and notebook inserts</li>
</ul><h2><span id="FAQs">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Is_there_an_A5_sized_Travelers_Notebook">Is there an A5 sized Traveler’s Notebook?</span></h3>
<p>No, an official Traveler’s notebook in A5 does not exist. Chic Sparrow does sell a similar refillable, leather-covered notebook in A5 as do other, <a href="https://amzn.to/325etCx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lesser known brands</a>, but Traveler’s does not.</p>
<h3><span id="How_do_I_care_for_a_Travelers_Notebook_leather_cover">How do I care for a Traveler’s Notebook leather cover?</span></h3>
<p>The leather cover on a Traveler’s notebook is made to wear in and weather over time. It uses a natural dye that is beautiful but not as tough as some other leather products. The leather should never be washed or cleaned except in the case of a spill where it can be blotted with a damp cloth.</p>
<h3><span id="What_do_I_do_if_the_Travelers_notebook_cover_gets_wet">What do I do if the Traveler’s notebook cover gets wet?</span></h3>
<p>If the leather cover gets wet, you should pat it dry, not rub it, so as to not pull out any of the natural dye. Unnecessary rubbing or friction can pull dye from the leather when it’s wet, so this should be minimized. When as much of the moisture is removed as possible the notebook should be emptied and left to dry in the shade, not out in the sun.</p>
<h3><span id="What_to_do_if_notebooks_cover_has_a_stain_or_blemish">What to do if notebook’s cover has a stain or blemish?</span></h3>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook’s cover was lightly treated exactly so that the cover could wear in. Try to ignore the blemish and continue to use the notebook. Over time it will wear and developer a patina and personality and the blemish will be unnoticeable (or at least well hidden). Unsightly stains and oil spots can be treated carefully with any leather cleaner or leather care cream, though try a small patch first to make sure the natural dye is not affected.</p>

                    <blockquote>Extracting data tables from HTML &amp; PDF documents is like using a rock as a hammer and a screw as a nail.</blockquote><p>As part of building <a href="https://quisir.com/">Quisir</a>, the above analogy summarizes well what we went through. Equipped with sedimentary &amp; other metamorphic rocks as well as millions of slotted &amp; cruciform screws, we began a year ago our mission to extract and structure each and every data table available in the world’s public companies’ disclosures - a bit naïvely.</p><p>After all, billions of people keep producing &amp; consuming tables in order to arrange data as to provide a familiar way to convey information. What could be problematic in building a technology that automatically identifies, extracts and structures the content of these tables from their original document?</p><p>It turns out that the PDF &amp; HTML format files, while being the de-facto standards to communicate business and scientific information, have been primarily designed to display rich textual data for the purpose of human readability. They allow for extreme layout flexibility and their underlying content can be specified in countless ways, making it cumbersome to build robust algorithms that can handle the large number of edge-cases.</p><p>We documented our journey in the PDF &amp; HTML data extraction world. Below are visual examples highlighting some of the issues we encountered along the way to create one of the world’s most comprehensive database of numeric facts on publicly listed companies.</p><h2 id="extracting-tables-from-html-documents">Extracting tables from HTML documents</h2><p>In its mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has historically established strict guidelines regarding public corporations’ financial disclosures, from a content to a document layout perspective.</p><p>For instance, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/specifications/edgarfm-vol2-v54.pdf">Filer Manual – Volume II</a> is a 917 page document that outlines the acceptable HTML document tags a company can use along with their respective acceptable attributes. It also includes file naming conventions and thousands of other rules that are aimed at standardizing the financial reporting process and its output.</p><p>Theoretically, this is an awesome framework (along with the XBRL standard which we will discuss in another article) that has the potential to truly facilitate developers’ lives - providing them with an actual hammer and sharp nails. We therefore happily started building a custom library to parse HTML efficiently in order to extract the &lt;table&gt; elements from millions of filings in a reasonable time.</p><p>Practically, this ride was not as smooth as we planned. We encountered large bumps in the road, rocks in our shoes and screws in our tires. For example:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png 902w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: Form 10-K - Tesla Motors, Inc – 31/12/2012</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of using &lt;li&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; tags to create the above looking list, each of the bullet points are constructed as individual tables containing 1 row and 4 columns – the bullet points being located in the second column and the text content in the fourth.</p><p>Some developers (or more probably the HTML generation software the people preparing these filings use) consider the &lt;table&gt; tag as a stylistic element rather than as an ordered arrangement of data in rows and columns. It is a fact - this pattern has been detected in almost all SEC filings.</p><p>We thought, “Let’s solve this issue by building a robust machine learning binary classifier to detect and discard these unfaithful data tables.” <em>(NB: we were excited to achieve 99.7% classification accuracy on a 50k sample after few days).</em></p><p>Alas, the SEC filings had more surprises for us:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/table_code.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/table_code.png 600w, https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/table_code.png 1000w, https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/table_code.png 1335w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: Form 10-Q - Aztar Corp – 02/10/2003</figcaption></figure><p>The right-hand side of the picture above is a screen-shot of the code pertaining to the cell highlighted in blue on the left-hand side.</p><p>You see it right. All the visually discernible rows are nested within a single row! The fix was easy - simply split on the &lt;br&gt; tags to obtain a faithful representation of the visual table and this edge case was handled.</p><p>Until we ran into another exception. And another one. And another one again. The list can go on. We found hundreds, if not thousands of exceptions we had to properly handle if we wanted to be really serious about our data extraction process.</p><p>For example, below is another difficulty that one can expect to run into regularly with these HTML documents. The human eye sees this table as one, yet it was coded as two individual tables having no relationship with one another. That said, the bottom table highlighted in blue cannot be structured properly without the header information of the top table.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/table_split.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/table_split.png 600w, https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/table_split.png 638w"><figcaption>Source: Form 10-Q – 3M company – 31/03/2019</figcaption></figure><p>We also encountered nested &lt;table&gt; tags even though the SEC explicitly indicates on page 69 of their 917 pages manual that “No nested &lt;TABLE&gt; tags” are allowed.</p><p>In the end, our team took the decision to completely shift the tabular data extraction process towards an end-to-end deep learning approach.

As a matter of fact, while SEC filings are mostly composed of monochromatic text and tables, these documents include beautifully designed graphs, charts, tables, backgrounds and pictures.</p><p>By definition, every company has a different marketing strategy and positioning as to differentiate itself from its peers. This translates directly into widely different marketing materials that include an infinite number of layouts, typesetting and formatting options – challenging the generalization power of our table identification algorithms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/color_table.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/color_table.png 600w, https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/color_table.png 876w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: Annual Review – Nestle – 2018</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, it is not uncommon to encounter data tables such as the one above that embed all sorts of graphs within certain rows and columns for the purpose of improving human readability at the impediment of machine readability. <em>In case you are wondering, our solution here was to detect the presence of images within a table’s bounding box coordinates and filter these regions out.</em></p><p>Overall, the most effective process we found to achieve outstanding results in table detection within PDF documents is iterative: label lots of data, train an instance segmentation algorithm, find ways to detect false positives/true negatives and their prevalence, fix the most frequently arising ones and start the loop over and over again… until you get a model that is able to identify tables with a similar degree of precision:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: Annual Report – Bucher Industries AG – 2019</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>Table or not table – how would you have labeled this one?</em></blockquote><p>Even if our computer vision models were achieving 100% accuracy in detecting data tables, the PDF format file makes the extraction and structuring parts the most complex given their flexible nature.

Although our team is always excited to discover inspirational quotes, catch secret information or crack encrypted messages, these hidden text blocks mostly contained things like:</p><blockquote><em>“of the Group. The Company intends to lodge its NGER Report for the Group for the period FY2015 in October 2015. An energy target has been set for the first time for period FY2016, at a 2.5% reduction of total carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO2-e)”</em></blockquote><p>We noticed that these hidden elements were always present in other pages of the documents. After quite some research and method trials, we figured that the most effective solution to deal with this issue was to run the corresponding problematic pages through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms.</p><p>To finish this article on a great note, below are two screenshots of one table that bears not one, but two complexities:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.quisir.com/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png 902w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Using the highest resolution satellite imagery currently available - Worldview 3 – from Maxar Technologies and deep learning, (TensorFlow API, Google Brain) researchers at the University of Oxford Wildlife Conservation Research Unit and Machine Learning Research Group have detected elephants from space with comparable accuracy to human detection capabilities.

<br></p><p>Finding a needle in a haystack is a challenge, but counting elephants from space sounds like science fiction, but that is exactly what a team led by <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wildcru.org%2F&amp;t=MmRmZDNmMGQwMTkxYTZmNzVhZmJhZDk4ZTNiMmVmYWQwOTcyNGE0MyxkTlc2THRmOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638430835121455104%2Fdetecting-elephants-from-space&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159735">WildCRU’s</a> <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wildcru.org%2Fmembers%2Fms-isla-duporge%2F&amp;t=ZDM0ZTljOTUyYzJjNGNhNDlmMThlNzk4MDFmZjU5YzY3YWM0Y2MyYixkTlc2THRmOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638430835121455104%2Fdetecting-elephants-from-space&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159735">Isla Duporge</a> has achieved.</p><p>The population of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) has plummeted over the last century due to poaching, retaliatory killing from crop raiding and habitat fragmentation. To conserve them requires knowledge of where they are, and how many there are: accurate monitoring is vital.</p><p>Existing methods are prone to error. Inaccurate counts lead to misallocation of scarce conservation resources and misunderstanding population trends.</p><p>Currently the most common survey technique for elephant populations in savannah environments is aerial counts from manned aircraft. Observers on aerial surveys can get exhausted, be hindered by poor visibility and otherwise succumb to bias, and aerial surveys can be costly and logistically challenging.</p><p>A team from the University of Oxford (WildCRU: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoo.ox.ac.uk%2F&amp;t=NTk1OGRhOGYxNmUxOGNhNTc0YjRjZjAzNDhjNmNkMTY2ZTU5NGZhZCxkTlc2THRmOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638430835121455104%2Fdetecting-elephants-from-space&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159735">Department of Zoology</a> and the Machine Learning Research Group: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Feng.ox.ac.uk%2F&amp;t=OGNmYmFhMDM5MGQyMjIzZmVmNmIwZjA0Zjg4OTQ3Y2UzMmU4MjkzMixkTlc2THRmOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638430835121455104%2Fdetecting-elephants-from-space&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159735">Department of Engineering</a>) in collaboration with Dr Olga Isupova, University of Bath and Dr. Tiejun Wang, University of Twente, set out to solve these problems.</p><p>Remotely sensing elephants using satellite imagery and automating detection via deep learning provides a new method for surveying elephants and also solves various existing challenges. Satellites can collect upward of 5000 km² imagery in one pass captured in a matter of minutes, eliminating the risk of double counting. Repeat surveys are also possible at short intervals.</p><p>Satellite monitoring is an unobtrusive technique requiring no ground presence thus eliminating the risk of disturbing species, or of concern for human safety during data collection. Previously inaccessible areas are rendered accessible, and cross-border areas – often crucial to conservation planning - can be surveyed without the time-consuming requirement of terrestrial permits.</p><figure data-orig-height="575" data-orig-width="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/330a68aed805cffd8328317f7dd05bd9/b0c284a6b721a8fd-0e/s1280x1920/74353fea5a59109823c02a8fb696af59062ab79a.jpg" data-orig-height="575" data-orig-width="1200" width="1200" height="575" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Raw image in homogenous area compared with CNN detections (green boxes) and ground truth labels (red boxes) Worldview-3 Satellite images.

However, automating detection means a process that would formally have taken months can be completed in a matter of hours. Furthermore, machines are less prone to error, false negatives and false positives in deep learning algorithms are consistent and can be rectified by systematically improving models- the same cannot be said for humans.<br></p><p>To develop this new method, the team created a customised training dataset of more than 1000 elephants in South Africa, which was fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the results were compared to human performance. Elephants, it turns out, can be detected in satellite imagery with accuracy as high as human detection capabilities. The results (known as the F2 score) of the CNN models was 0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in homogenous areas, compared with, an averaged human detection capability F2 score of 0.77 in heterogeneous areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. The model could even detect elephants in places far from the training data site showing the generalisability of the model. Having trained the machine only on adults, it was then able to identify calves.</p><p>The researchers believe that this demonstrates the power of technology to serve conservation: satellite remote sensing and deep learning technologies offer promise to the conservation of these majestic mammals. Conservation technologies open a new world of possibilities, to be embraced with the urgency necessitated by the sixth mass extinction and the global plight of biodiversity.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ox.ac.uk%2Fnews%2F2020-12-18-spotting-elephants-space-satellite-revolution&amp;t=ODIyYjgwM2MxM2E4MWQ0NTRmZjhiNmJiY2RjZmI5ZjRiYmJjNjNhZCxkTlc2THRmOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638430835121455104%2Fdetecting-elephants-from-space&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159735">University of Oxford</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Using very‐high‐resolution satellite imagery and deep learning to detect and count African elephants in heterogeneous landscapes”,&nbsp;<i>Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1002%2Frse2.195&amp;t=YzNmNTJhNzUyNGNmMWFlMTQxZDZmM2E4YzgxNDViZGI3YjFiNDMyNixkTlc2THRmOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638430835121455104%2Fdetecting-elephants-from-space&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609159735">https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.195</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/628996538137542656/tracking-tech-rhinos-in-namibia">Novel tracking tech could help fight rhino poaching in Namibia</a></p>

<p>I’m talking to you, Mr. or Mrs. Person who keeps saying “I should really start a blog.” Or maybe it’s more like “I should really post to my poor, lonely blog.”</p>



<p>Yes, you should. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/02/write-5x-more-but-write-5x-less/">I already wrote my manifesto on why</a>, so I won’t repeat it here. But you should. So either <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">do it or stop talking about it</a>.</p>



<p>Stop waiting for motivation, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/18/discipline-eats-motivation-for-breakfast/">use some discipline</a>. Make writing a part of your daily routine.</p>



<p>For me, when I sit down at my desk in the morning I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/18/100-daily-blog-posts/">write a quick blog post</a>. It’s how I ramp up for the day. Maybe that works for you too, and maybe not. But either way, work it into your routine somewhere or it won’t become a habit.</p>



<p>Do it, right now. Schedule it on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">your calendar</a>. Make a plan. Tell yourself it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">just an experiment</a>, so it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">not scary</a> or permanent.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll be glad you did. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/">I know I am</a>!</p>
