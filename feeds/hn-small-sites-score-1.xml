                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

		<p>Python Notebooks provide interactive computing environment that is perfect for experimenting with data. The Notebooks are widely used by Data Scientists in data analysis and discovery tasks. Currently, there are many versions of Notebooks. The first, and the most used version is <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>. There are also many cloud-based Notebooks, like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks">Kaggle Notebooks</a> or <a href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc Notebooks</a>.</p>

<p>The transparency of created Machine Learning pipeline is very important in the <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">MLJAR AutoML</a>. Starting from the version <code>0.9.1</code> the MLJAR AutoML provides support for displaying interactive reports from AutoML training directly in the Python Notebook.</p>

<p>If you didn’t try yet MLJAR AutoML, you can easily check it out. It is available at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised</a>. It is open-source, with MIT license. It works with tabular data and supports binary, multiclass classification, and regression.</p>

<h2 id="automl-training-report-in-the-notebook">AutoML Training Report in the Notebook</h2>

<p>The MLJAR <code>AutoML</code> class provides the <code>report()</code> method for displaying report directly in the Notebook. After training the <code>AutoML</code> just call <code>report()</code> on <code>AutoML</code> object. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MLJAR AutoML in <code>Explain</code> mode: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/mljar-automl-explain-tabular-playground-mar-21">link to the notebook</a>,</li>
  <li>MLJAR AutoML in <code>Compete</code> mode: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/8h-mljar-automl-tabular-playground-mar-202">link to the notebook</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-example-report">The Example Report</h3>

<p>Below is the screenshot from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/mljar-automl-explain-tabular-playground-mar-21">example report</a>. You can click on <code>Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis Report</code> to open EDA plots. There is <code>&lt;&lt; Go back</code> link there, which will redirect you to the main view.</p>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/automl_explain_in_notebook.png" alt="AutoML Explain in the Notebook"></p>

<p>Please click on the selected model name, for example on the <code>3_Default_Xgboost</code>. It will redirect you to model’s report, where you can check the model details, like: hyperparameters values, metrics, learning curves and explanations (if available).</p>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_1.png" alt="Xgboost 1 in the Notebook"></p>

<img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_4.png" alt="Xgboost 4 in the Notebook"></p>

<p>There is <code>&lt;&lt; Go back</code> link at the top (and the bottom of each model report) that will redirect you to the main view. You can easily navigate the AutoML training report.</p>

<p>What is more, all reports data and files are available in the hard drive. They can be easily commited to the GitHub and displayed there. The report files are presented as <code>README.md</code> files.</p>

<p>Link to report in the Github: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-examples/tree/master/Iris_classification/AutoML_1">Iris classification with AutoML</a>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The MLJAR AutoML works perfectly with Python Notebooks. It provides interactive reports from the AutoML training. Reports can be displayed directly in the Notebook by calling the <code>report()</code> method.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>
Quickly learn if a site speed change will have a positive impact, without hassling your dev team.
</p></div>
<p>Improving site speed can be <b>complicated</b>. It's surprisingly common to roll out a change that should lead to a performance improvement, only to find that - frustratingly - things have gotten slower.</p>
<p>And a lot of the time, this is how site speed works - you have to approach it like you're running an experiment, where you benchmark your baseline, make a change, and then test to see if you've made an impact.</p>
<p>But this approach can also be slow - especially if you're having to ask developers to make these changes, and then they have to find time in their schedule to implement them (and then, potentially, roll them back). In situations like that, you have a slow feedback loop - it takes a long time between "let's see if this works" to finding out the results.</p>
<h2>A fast feedback loop</h2>
<p>Chrome DevTools has a feature called <b>Local Overrides</b> that can drastically improve that feedback loop. Instead of having to wait for a developer to add your change, you can first try it out on your local machine to measure the potential impact.</p>
<p>It works by saving a copy of the page you're working on (or any other resource, like a JavaScript or CSS file), letting you edit that, and then serving that file instead of the live version.</p>
<p>Here's how I test whether site speed changes might work, without having to push those changes live first.</p>
<h2>Setting up local overrides</h2>
<p>The first step is to get overrides set up on your computer. Open Chrome DevTools (Option + ⌘ + J on mac, or right-click and inspect element), click on the Sources tab, and then click the &gt;&gt; button in the left-hand side bar to find the Overrides panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/overrides.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>From here, click "Select folder for overrides", and choose somewhere to save your new editable copies of files. I just use a folder that's tucked away somewhere named "Local Overrides", but you do you.</p>
<h2>Finding the baseline</h2>
<p>You need to know what your baseline is before you can see if a change improves or harms performance. Most of the time, the metric I'm trying to improve is <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint</a>, so I built a JavaScript snippet that's heavily inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/tkadlec/683b26344cde774170b94c0fcf0088b4">Tim Kadlec's perf-diagnostics.css</a>.</p>
<p>To add it, right-click on your Chrome bookmark bar, click <b>Add Page</b>, add the name "Highlight LCP", and then add this as the URL:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:(function(){var paintEntries = performance.getEntriesByType("paint");var entries = [];new PerformanceObserver((entryList) =&gt; {for (const entry of entryList.getEntries()) {entries.push(entry);}var element = entries[entries.length - 1];var lcp = entries[entries.length - 1]["loadTime"];var fcp = paintEntries[1]["startTime"];console.log("FCP is " + Math.round((fcp + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100 + " ms");console.log("LCP is " + lcp + " ms");element["element"].style.border="4px solid gold";}).observe({type: 'largest-contentful-paint', buffered: true});})();
</code></pre>
<p>When you click that bookmark it'll add a gold border to the LCP element, and show both the FCP and the LCP timings in the DevTools console.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/wiggle.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>At this point, I like to run 3 tests on the new, locally stored page. You don't want to compare your edited local page with the live version - so to do that, I use local overrides to add an extra line-break into the code somewhere.</p>
<p>From the Overrides menu, it'll prompt you to hit Ctrl + P to open a file. Select the page that you want to edit, and you should see the source code appear. From here, I usually add an extra blank space or a line break, and then hit save. You want to make sure that there's a blue dot next to the file name, which tells you that it's now serving a local version of the file. Also, make sure you've got Enabled Local Overrides checked.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/local-overrides-devtools.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Under the Network tab, I'll usually throttle my connection to Fast 3G when running my tests. This is largely because I want to focus on users who have a slower connection because if you can improve performance for them then you'll also improve performance for the average user. It's also useful because it makes it clearer if a performance change is having an impact.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/throttle-connection.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now that's all set up - I normally run 3 tests, making a note of the First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint values using the JavaScript bookmarklet.</p>
<p>To do that, I use Chrome's option to empty the cache and hard reload the page each time (if you have DevTools open, it appears as an option if you hold down the refresh icon).</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/hard-reload.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Those 3 sets of numbers you have? Take the middle number for both FCP and LCP (even if they were in different test runs). That's your median - so those are the numbers that you'll be benchmarking any changes against. Feel free to run more tests if you want to be extra sure, but I find 3 normally does the trick.</p>
<h2>Removing the anti-flicker snippet</h2>
<p>I'm going to use the cycle page for <a href="https://www.wiggle.co.uk/cycle">Wiggle</a> as an example here. They're not a customer, and I have no connection there - I just noticed some potential speed optimisations that Local Overrides could show off. Also, this is very much not a dig at Wiggle - the site is well built, and there are very likely good reasons for some of these engineering decisions. I've only chosen them because I think there are a few tweaks that could result in speed improvements.</p>
<p>After throttling my connection to 3G and testing the page 3 times, my median First Contentful Paint was <b>5,231 ms</b> and my Largest Contentful Paint was <b>13,221 ms</b>.</p>
<p>I noticed that Wiggle were using the anti-flicker snippet from Google Optimize. A/B testing software sometimes suggests this - it effectively hides the page completely until either the Optimize JavaScript has loaded and run, or 4 seconds have passed - whichever is soonest. 4 seconds is a long time to hide content, and could explain why slower connections are seeing an FCP of over 5 seconds. Andy Davies' has <a href="https://andydavies.me/blog/2020/11/16/the-case-against-anti-flicker-snippets/">a really useful post on anti-flicker snippets</a>, which is worth checking out if you'd like to know more.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/antiflicker-snippet.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>I wanted to see what impact removing that anti-flicker snippet would have. I used Local Overrides to delete that whole snippet, and then re-ran the test 3 times. The median First Contentful Paint dropped from <b>5,231 ms</b> to <b>2,217 ms</b> - an improvement of <b>58%</b>.</p>
<h2>Un-hiding the hero carousel</h2>
<p>With the JavaScript bookmarklet, I was able to see that the LCP element was the hero header image. Wiggle seem to use a carousel for this, but they only show the first slide. In either case - the approach seems to hide the carousel by default, and then unhide it with JavaScript. It looks like it adds a CSS class named <code>owl-loaded</code> to the carousel once it's loaded, which then reveals it to the user.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what it would look like if it didn't hide the carousel by default, so with Chrome's Local Overrides I added the <code>owl-loaded</code> class directly. This isn't perfect, and if the plan was to change how that carousel worked, I'm sure there would be much more elegant ways to approach this - but I wanted to get a sense of whether LCP could be improved by showing the hero carousel straight away.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/owl-loaded.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Re-running the tests after adding <code>owl-loaded</code> to the carousel resulted in the LCP dropping from <b>13,221 ms</b> to <b>5,429 ms</b>, an improvement of <b>59%</b>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Local Overrides allow you to experiment with site speed fixes on your local machine, so you have a really fast feedback loop. It's useful for helping you debug, spot issues, and test whether things like deferring JavaScript will break the page layout.</p>
<p>But for me, the biggest benefit is that it lets you be a lot more confident with the recommendations that you give.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Uber is one of the leaders in ride-sharing in the US and in Europe. However, they are having troubles in expanding to Asian continent. For example Ubers expansion to China failed, and Uber in China was acquired by DiDi. </p>
<p>In Sri Lanka the monopoly in ride-sharing is held by PickMe, with Uber at the second place. PickMe started as a small startup in Sri Lanka. They saw what Uber is doing in the USA and basically cloned the idea in Sri Lanka, and instead of taxis they used TukTuks, a popular three-wheel vehicles found in Asia that are similar to a Taxi in New York.</p>
<p>When Uber announced that they are starting operations in Sri Lanka, I thought they are going to give a good run for PickMe’s money, because Uber has deep wallets than PickMe, Uber has better technology than PickMe. And with cash in hand, Uber might be able to give competitive rates, and attract more users than PickMe.</p>
<p>However, years have passed and Uber is still at the second place, while PickMe has expanded and they are way ahead of Uber in Sri Lanka. It’s not the lack of cash or technology that defeated Uber in Sri Lanka, which they have plenty more than PickMe. </p>
<p>So what made Uber less successful in Sri Lanka than PickMe?</p>
<h2>Uber didn’t have an office in Sri Lanka, customers weren’t happy</h2>
<p>Even though initially there was an Uber office in Sri Lanka, slowly it was replaced by an office in India, which handled operations in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>This led to scores of unhappy customers because, </p>
<ul><li>There was no hotline that handled complaints on behalf of users. The local number of the Uber office never worked, because almost all operations were done by an office in India.</li><li>Customers could not get any refunds when they were charged incorrectly.</li><li>Even when a user complained via the app, there was very little response, because for the office in India, they never cared about giving a good customer service for Sri Lanka.</li></ul>
<p>These unsatisfied customers meant more rides for PickMe. Yes, PickMe riders are the same set of riders who are Uber riders, but at least PickMe has a working customer hotline, and are very responsive in their app. I have received multiple refunds though Pickme when I was overcharged, but Uber zero refunds.</p>
<h2>Uber didn’t process payments well, and drivers weren’t happy</h2>
<p>Uber had this policy where they transferred money received by users who paid by credit cards to their drivers at the end of each month. </p>
<p>This made the drivers very unhappy, because most of these TukTuk drivers made a daily wage from their rides, and they didn’t want to do rides where they received money at the end of the month.</p>
<p>I’m one of those users who pay to ride-sharing with my credit card, I was asked numerous times for where riders asked me to either pay by cash, or they will call upfront and if I’m paying via my credit card they will cancel the ride.</p>
<p>However, PickMe’s payments were instant, when someone paid by card, the driver will get the money to their account within several hours, not at the end of the month.</p>
<p>There were other reasons that made both drivers and customers both unhappy, but these were the to main reasons that I can remember which made people pick PickMe over Uber.</p>
<p>Uber was making both drivers and users both unhappy at the same time, a very bad combination to have. </p>
<p>Soon more and more people started using PickMe more, and drivers also given up Uber towards PickMe. </p>
<p>Now Uber is playing a catchup game with PickMe to win back their lost rides, but at times it feels as if Uber has given up on winning the ride-sharing battle and focusing on something different. </p>

<h2>Uber is now king in food delivery in Sri Lanka</h2>
<p>For some reason Uber is doing quite well in food delivering in Sri Lanka. Here PickMe was late to the party, and Uber started their food devilry before PickMe. </p>
<p>The Uber eats app is more polished than PickMe. And even though I haven’t tried both food delivery apps, so I don’t know the real reason why Uber is ahead of food delivery in Sri Lanka but not in ride-sharing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the take away message is, even if you have deep pockets, and technology, you still can lose to a startup with far less cash, and technology if you are providing a poor service.</p>

            <p>Many tests for an operation iterate over a mapping of different inputs to expected outcomes. By looking at the tests for a single operation as the same test with different inputs and output expectations, we can start to question how we should model those tests.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-matrices">Tests as Matrices</h2>
<p>By simply enumerating every possible combination of input values, we can construct a matrix with as many dimensions as inputs. We can then define the expected result for each set of inputs, and write a generalised test function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>∀ input∈{(a, b, …, n) | a∈A, b∈B, …, n∈N} f(input)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of possible test cases is thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>s</em>| = |A × B × ⋯ × N|</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as our operation accepts an input that has more than a few possible values, that is any kind of number,<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>With more than 8 bits at least. One could reasonably enumerate 256 different inputs for an operation, for correctness proven by test.</span></span> string, or complex data structure, enumerating every possible input combination becomes impractical. Instead we can resort to groupings of values via properties.</p>
<p>This is a test matrix for division which uses properties instead of values, with the rows being dividends, and the columns divisors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>÷</th>
<th>Positive</th>
<th>Zero</th>
<th>Negative</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Negative</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Positive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Matrices like this are necessarily exhaustive,<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Unless we designate a special result to mean “<em>do not test this set of inputs</em>”.</span></span> and force us to think about the result for every possible combination of the input values we have included.</p>
<p>This is an implementation of the same property matrix in Clojure:</p>

<p>In this case we are testing a safe variant of the division function <code>/</code>, which returns <code>nil</code> if the divisor is zero. This simplifies the testing process, because we do not have to include any exception catching logic in our test function, or invent a notation to mean <em>this set of inputs should result in a thrown exception</em>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that such a direct interpretation of a matrix is only possible in a language as malleable as Clojure. In other languages, we might have to resort to enumerating a set of <code>(dividend
divisor result)</code> tuples, losing the guarantee of covering all possible combinations.</p>
<p>But even in Clojure, more than two dimensions in this matrix will quickly become unwieldy and hard to follow, and a tuple-based approach would scale better to larger numbers of input parameters.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-trees">Tests as Trees</h2>
<p>Another way we could structure our tests is as a tree. A tree does not have to be exhaustive the same way a matrix has to be.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Again, assuming we are using a matrix based approach, rather than enumerating combinations manually.</span></span> We can omit certain combinations of inputs by pruning their branches. In this way we are implying that if a single input has a given value, it defines the result regardless of the other inputs’ values.</p>
<p>In the division example all branches with a divisor of zero could be collapsed into a single case, as the dividend does not matter in this case. This only works if the first level of branching describes the divisor, and the dividends are on the second level.</p>

<p>This might look more verbose, but in exchange we get a unique label for every tree branch,<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>We can also make use of useful property of <code>clojure.test</code>: if a test fails, it will traverse the <code>testing</code> statements upwards and concatenate the names, providing us with the path of the failed test. For example “<em>with a negative divisor and a zero dividend</em>”.</span></span> which can improve readability. The nesting also naturally lends itself to lexical scoping, so we only have the values in scope which apply on a given branch.</p>
<p>A key advantage of the tree structure is flexibility. If one of the branches requires special code, we can confine it to that branch, avoiding complicating the remaining branches more than necessary.</p>
<p>Trees also scale better with larger numbers of inputs or options for inputs. A tree might grow overly wide or deep, but we can split it if that becomes a problem.</p>
<p>There is a downside to omitting branches though. If we change our <code>safe-divide</code> function to return different results depending on the dividend when the divisor is zero, our tests might still pass, depending on the specific inputs used, but we will lose test coverage for certain code paths. We have chosen to not test certain input combinations, and we need to be aware of this omission when we are changing the code under test.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-definitions">Tests as Definitions</h2>
<p>Considering the formula describing the generalised test function above, we could also consider translating this directly into code. This can work, but only if we can test results without re-implementing large parts of the code under test, otherwise we are overly coupling the tests to the code. In the division case, we can decide the sign of the result<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>Or the existence, for that matter.</span></span> based on the signs of the inputs.</p>

<p>This solution is specific to Clojure, though many other languages have property based testing tools that work similarly.</p>
<p>By adding a spec to our function, we can run a large number of different inputs against our function, and assert a property about the result based on the inputs. It will even shrink the inputs to find the simplest set of inputs to trigger a spec failure.</p>
<p>This means we do not have a programmer writing a matrix or a tree by hand anymore, which has some advantages. The main one being that a programmer might not consider all possible inputs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The optimal shape of a test depends mainly on the structure of the inputs to the operation we are testing, as well as its nature.</p>
<p>For pure functions which we expect to use widely and change rarely, property-based testing can be desirable to avoid unintended consequences. There is also a certain speed requirement for test shrinking to work effectively.</p>
<p>Operations with a small number of possible inputs can also be tested via test matrices, which have fewer limitations, but do not guarantee …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

      <p><strong>Ab 2021 können im Kanton Zug Steuerschulden mit Kryptowährungen beglichen werden. Akzeptiert werden die Währungen Bitcoin und Ether. Möglich wird dies dank einer Zusammenarbeit mit Bitcoin Suisse, einer Pionierin im Schweizer Crypto Valley. Zug ist damit der erste Schweizer Kanton, in dem Steuern mit Kryptowährungen bezahlt werden können.</strong></p>
<p>Der Kanton Zug wird seiner Rolle als Vorreiter in den neuen Blockchain-Technologien erneut gerecht und bietet als erster Schweizer Kanton die Möglichkeit an, Steuerschulden mit Kryptowährungen zu bezahlen. Die kantonale Steuerverwaltung akzeptiert dieses neue Zahlungsmittel ab Februar 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Kanton Zug fördert Kryptowährungen<br></strong>Der Kanton Zug beheimatet eine überdurchschnittlich grosse Anzahl Unternehmen aus der Krypto-Branche. «Als Heimat des Crypto Valleys ist es uns wichtig, den Einsatz von Kryptowährungen im Alltag weiter zu fördern und zu vereinfachen», sagt Finanzdirektor Heinz Tännler und fügt an: «Durch die Möglichkeit, Steuerschulden mit Bitcoin oder Ether bezahlen zu können, machen wir einen grossen Schritt in diese Richtung.» Die Steuerbegleichung mittels Kryptowährung wird sowohl Gesellschaften als auch Privatpersonen bis zu einem Forderungsbetrag von 100'000 Franken zur Verfügung stehen. Teilzahlungen werden nicht akzeptiert. In den kommenden Wochen findet ein Pilot statt, um die Prozesse zu testen, damit bis zum nächsten Steuerrechnungslauf im Februar 2021 alles bereit ist.</p>
<p><strong>QR-Code bei Steuerverwaltung beantragen<br></strong>Ermöglicht wird die Steuerbegleichung mit Kryptowährungen durch die Crypto-Payments-Lösung des im Kanton Zug ansässigen Unternehmens Bitcoin Suisse. Wollen Steuerzahlende ihre Rechnung in Kryptowährung bezahlen, können sie dies der Steuerverwaltung mitteilen. Sie erhalten danach den dafür notwendigen QR-Code (i.d.R. per E-Mail) zugestellt. Finanzdirektor Heinz Tännler stellt klar: «Wir gehen mit der neuen Zahlungsmethode kein Risiko ein, da wir den Betrag auch bei einer Bezahlung in Bitcoin oder Ether immer in Schweizer Franken erhalten.» Somit haben auch grössere Schwankungen im Krypto-Wechselkurs keinen Einfluss auf die geleistete Zahlung in Schweizer Franken.</p>
<p><strong>Zusammenarbeit mit Bitcoin Suisse<br></strong>Die Zuger Finanzdirektion hat sich für eine Zusammenarbeit mit dem 2013 gegründeten Unternehmen Bitcoin Suisse entschieden. Bitcoin Suisse bringt in die Partnerschaft mit dem Kanton Zug mehr als sieben Jahre Erfahrung in der Kryptotechnologie und im Zahlungsverkehr ein. Dr. Arthur Vayloyan, CEO von Bitcoin Suisse sagt: «Die Kombination von Handelstechnologie und Zahlungsverkehr mit Kryptowährungen ermöglicht uns, dem Steuerzahler eine gute Benutzererfahrung zu bieten und dem Kanton Zug einen ausgereiften Service zu offerieren.» Bitcoin Suisse hat das Krypto- und Blockchain-Ökosystem in der Schweiz massgeblich geprägt und war eine treibende Kraft bei der Entwicklung des «Crypto Valleys» und der «Crypto Nation Switzerland». Als regulierter Schweizer Finanzintermediär in der Lizenzierungsphase für die Schweizer und Liechtensteinische Banklizenz, bietet Bitcoin Suisse Prime Brokerage, Verwahrung, Crypto Payments, besicherte Darlehen, Staking, Tokenization und andere Krypto-Finanzdienstleistungen für private und institutionelle Kunden an.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The year is 1721. You are a rich person, and you want to put your
                wealth to use. You are approached by various people who buy goods in
                one part of the world, and sell them in another. They want you to
                finance some of their initial purchase and transportation costs, in
                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><p>I've been lazy with dependencies. Please wait while

<p><em>This is a guest post from Perry Tiu. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear New Developer,</p>



<p>Ask for great hardware.</p>



<p>Ask for that latest MacBook. Ask for that extra built-in 2TB of flash storage. Ask for that 32-inch monitor. Ask for that additional vertical monitor. Ask for that standing desk. Ask for that Aeron chair. Ask for that expensive USB-C hub. Ask for that ergonomic keyboard.</p>



<p>Now you may be thinking that you don’t want to be perceived as a burden to the company, or that you’re coming off as greedy and needy. I get it. If you had to purchase all of this yourself, it would surely be an unpleasant hole in your pocket. We all get it.</p>



<p>Fortunately in the bigger picture, this amount is actually minimal for companies compared to all the other costs related to hiring a new developer (salary, staff hours spent on interviewing individuals, etc). Most well-run companies regularly take into account these costs as they grow and there are many reasons why they are willing to invest in their staff’s developer experience. </p>



<p>One of the more obvious reasons is improving efficiency and productivity: having a laptop with an additional monitor setup is generally better than without. Interestingly, there are also indirect, not exactly tech-related, benefits. For example, being able to satisfy a developer’s needs improves work satisfaction, which contributes to employee retention. As long as you justify using the amazing hardware at your disposal, the return of investment in the long run far outweighs the cost of the hardware.</p>



<p>So ask away, treat yourself and embrace what modern technology has to offer. Your company should be there to help you grow in your role so don’t be shy. But more importantly: <strong>share your experience</strong>. Let people know what works for you, what doesn’t. Countless times have I learned new quality-of-life improvements just from hearing or seeing someone else live it. Not only will your peers and friends appreciate the discussion, it is also a collective push to improve each other’s developer experience.</p>



<p>Oh and it is harder to ask for upgrades down the road than when you just joined.</p>



<p>Sincerely written on an outdated machine,</p>



<p>Perry</p>

March 3, 2021 | https://remyhax.xyz/posts/bitsquatting-windows/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://remyhax.xyz/posts/bitsquatting-windows/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

The very name, Silicon Valley, comes from the birth of the semiconductor industry in the San Francisco bay area 60+ years ago. Large percentage of venture financing used to go to semiconductor startups, even as recently as 15 years ago. As a chip designer doing startups in the late ‘90s and early 2000s in the San Francisco bay area, I felt as if there was a semi startup on every street corner.</p><p>Not so much in the last 10 years. Maturing industry, high capital requirements, and dwindling exits have caused a huge decline in funding for semiconductor startups. The narrative of Silicon Valley moved to consumer internet and software-led businesses. Remember, software is eating the world. But in the last few years, we have seen a slow but steady resurgence of semiconductor startups and witnessed blockbuster financing and acquisitions. So, are semiconductor startups on the comeback trail? Or is it a mirage?</p><p>First, it is important to separate semiconductor startups from the overall semiconductor industry. Globally, the market for semiconductor products has been growing for several decades and in recent years led by growth in computers, smartphones, consumer electronics, and automotive and industrial electronics. Computers have gotten powerful, phones have faster internet speeds, consumer gadgets have gotten smaller – all because of the technological advances in semiconductors.</p><div><figure><img width="1024" height="497" src="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales.jpg 1628w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales.jpg 1628w"><figcaption>Source: “2020 State of the US Semiconductor Industry” from SIA</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a large growing market with improving technology why is there no place for new startups? While semiconductor is maturing as an industry, it is hardly a commoditized market with no place for innovation.</p><p>Well, structurally a few things happened:</p><ul type="1"><li>Cleantech, one of the prominent semiconductor sectors, had flopped badly, losing lots of capital for investors.</li><li>The technological advances made in internet infrastructure and mobile technologies led to a boom in the software application ecosystem across social, mobile, and cloud, moving entrepreneurial interest away from semiconductors.</li><li>China emerged as a large supplier of semiconductors, thus increasing competition while driving down premiums in the market.</li><li>Huge waves of consolidation happened in publicly traded semiconductor companies.</li></ul><p>Most sectors go through these phenomena – they are nothing new. When this happens, newer innovations kickstart the next disruption cycle. Why didn’t it happen with semi startups?</p><p>Well, the success of a startup ecosystem rests on the number and variety of experiments that are attempted. The more experiments across a wider variety of areas, the better the chances for a breakout success. For semiconductor startups, two main issues slowed down these experiments:</p><ul><li>It takes roughly $30M of financing to even get to a product and another $100M or more to get to volume production.</li><li>Buyer universe is limited because of the public market consolidation. The reduced list of buyers meant smaller acquisition premiums and smaller exits.</li></ul><p>Huge capital costs combined with a small buyer universe and small exits don’t make for an attractive investment area. Combine this with harder macro trend, we saw a vicious cycle of diminishing interest and funding in semiconductor startups.</p><p>Things have started turning around over the last few years. Since 2017, investments in semiconductor startups have increased significantly. So, what happened?</p><p>One of the main reasons is the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Innovative semiconductor products were required to meet the computing demand of AI. Advances in AI and Computer Vision helped make huge strides in autonomous vehicles and autonomous platforms. That drove demand for specialized semiconductor sensors and processor architectures.</p><p>The cost of building semiconductor products has come down significantly, especially if you are not operating at the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Most semiconductor products do not require these advanced processes. Today, you can build a first-generation semiconductor chip with $10M or less. That is lot less than $30M.</p><p>Expanding buyer universe – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and other large internet and software companies have started building semiconductors for their internal use and consumer products. They have become new acquirers of semiconductor startups.</p><p>US-China trade tensions have centered around semiconductors and there has been an increased focus on self-sufficiency and nationalization. This has driven demand for US semiconductor suppliers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-supply-chains-governors/eight-auto-state-governors-urge-biden-to-press-semiconductor-firms-on-chip-shortage-idUSKBN2AQ2MI">Chip shortages facing the automotive industry</a> is driving home the point of self sufficiency.</p><p>All these factors have driven huge investments and exits in Semiconductors recently. Just a few examples:</p><ul><li>Qualcomm acquired a two-year-old semiconductor startup, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/13/qualcomm-will-acquire-nuvia-server-cpu-maker-led-by-ex-apple-chip-architect/">Nuvia for $1.4B</a></li><li>Automotive Sensor Semiconductor companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/lidar-startup-luminar-to-go-public-via-3-4-billion-spac-merger/">Luminar</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/lidar-startup-aeva-to-go-public-via-2-1-billion-spac-merger/">Aeva</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">Aeye</a>, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/12/22/lidar-startup-ouster-go-public-1-9b-spac-merger/">Ouster</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/lidar-startup-innoviz-to-go-public-in-1-4-billion-spac-deal">Innoviz</a> all going public at valuation of $1B or more.</li><li>Investments flowing into semiconductor startups focused on AI, Quantum computing, Robotics, and others.</li></ul><p>So, are semiconductor startups back for good? As new areas come up including Quantum computing, Space technologies, Computational biology …&nbsp; the need for innovation and newer semiconductor products is on the rise. I remain bullish that the resurgence we have seen in semiconductor startups is here to stay. And once again, the name, Silicon Valley, will fit its description.</p><hr></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Given that the Psyche-C compiler frontend is being renewed, I decided to start a blog about the project. This is my first post.</p>

<p>Without further ado, consider this C program (assume that its name is <code>test.c</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>==</span> <span>v</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To produce and dump an AST with Psyche-C, we invoke the <em>cnippet</em> driver adaptor with command line option <code>--C-dump-AST</code>. The output is as follows:</p>

<p><img width="609" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 20 56 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109888794-e8d75f00-7c62-11eb-98bc-c62247df0c3e.png"></p>

<p>Now, I’ll briefly correlate the above AST with the one produced by <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> for the same <code>test.c</code> program. Let’s take a look at it:</p>

<p><img width="789" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 21 03 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109889407-17096e80-7c64-11eb-9ecd-b0bd56af902e.png"></p>

<p>Apart from the colors and extra decoration, what are the main differences between the two?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>It’s that Psyche-C’s AST is a bit closer to the grammar of C.</em> For instance, you can’t see <em>declarator</em>s in Clang’s AST, they are absorbed by their containing <em>declaration</em>s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not this characteristic is good or bad will depend on a given application. For the purpose of static analysis implementation, I consider the refined syntax insights of Psyche-C’s AST an advantage.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that every <em>node</em> in a AST should correspond to a <em>terminal</em> of the grammar. If so, we’d end up with a rather <strong>concrete</strong> syntax (or parse) tree, instead of an <strong>abstract</strong> syntax tree. A comprehensible AST will contain just enough of a language’s meaning embedded into it. (The AST produced by the <a href="https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/tree/original">old parser of Psyche-C</a>, e.g., was too grammar-oriented.)</p>

<p>Consider this snippet from our <code>test.c</code> program:</p>



<p>In Clang’s AST, it’s represented through a <code>VarDecl</code> and a <code>FunctionDecl</code>; both these nodes <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclaratorDecl.html">inherit from</a> <code>DeclaratorDecl</code> (i.e., a <em>declaration</em> with a <em>declarator</em>). But, in pedantic terms, that representation isn’t quite correct, given that a single <em>declaration</em> — one starting at <code>int</code> and ending at <code>;</code> — exists in that snippet.</p>

<p>In Psyche-C, I opted for a more rigorous representation in the AST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>VariableAndOrFunctionDeclaration</code> is created (just like Clang, this node <a href="https://ltcmelo.github.io/psychec/api-docs/html/classpsy_1_1_c_1_1_variable_and_or_function_declaration_syntax.html">inherits from</a> a <code>DeclaratorDeclaration</code>) with two child nodes: an <code>IdentifierDeclarator</code>, designating object of type <code>int</code>, and a <code>FunctionDeclarator</code>, designating a function whose return type is <code>int</code>. This choice makes the AST rewritable with accuracy as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the design “spirit” of Psyche-C’s AST is more aligned with that of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, the .NET compiler platform. Although, because Psyche-C is a frontend for C, its AST will, of course, resembles that of Clang.</p>

<p>To wrap up, I’ll leave a C# version of <code>test.c</code> (well, <code>test.cs</code>), together with its AST.</p>

Like many other false starts in cutting-edge research, the patent may represent the next step in the expanding theory, or it could mean the practical, real-world design of a functioning warp drive is on the horizon.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Background: How to Bend Space-Time with A Warp Drive</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After</span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;first publishing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;his groundbreaking 1994 warp drive concept in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity, Mexican Mathematician and Physicist Miguel Alcubierre received significant positive and negative feedback. Most applauded his solution, which did indeed appear to create a working theory on how a warp drive might allow faster than light travel without violating the laws of physics. In contrast,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html#:~:text=Warp%20Drive%20May%20Be%20More%20Feasible%20Than%20Thought%2C%20Scientists%20Say&amp;text=Now%20physicists%20say%20that%20adjustments,of%20science%20fiction%20into%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">others zeroed in</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on the incredible amount of energy needed to propel his theoretical spacecraft.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><br>
The warp drive was further refined in 2007 by engineer H. David Froning Jr., who, among other things, previously worked for the U.S. Air Force, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas. He</span><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.57491" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;published those refinements</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in 2008 and later released a</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081NV86G7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;2019 book</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on his research.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Both theories took a giant leap forward in 2011 when</span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110015936" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;a paper published</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by NASA scientist Harold G. “Sonny” White further improved upon Alcubierre’s designs, dramatically reducing the amount of exotic matter needed to fuel the hypothetical drive from a Jupiter sized amount&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html#:~:text=Warp%20Drive%20May%20Be%20More%20Feasible%20Than%20Thought%2C%20Scientists%20Say&amp;text=Now%20physicists%20say%20that%20adjustments,of%20science%20fiction%20into%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to something akin to the</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;size of the NASA Voyager 1 probe. While this is still a significant volume and well beyond our current ability to manufacture, this dramatic reduction in fuel requirements seems to indicate that a real-world warp drive may one day be feasible.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One practical attempt to build a drive is being made by Nebraska University Adjunct Professor David Pares and his company, </span><a href="http://paresspacewarpresearch.org/2019/03/27/space-warp-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Space Warp Dynamics</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. He posted a</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvEkQXbYds&amp;fbclid=IwAR2OIAOSN7hs0UBWUovJOQr4FMjfMVPEATbOf34m03h9kfO5Ip_HUqTsm4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;recent series of tests</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to YouTube; however, his company’s </span><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/space-warp-drive#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indiegogo campaign to build such a device</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;has only reached 3% of the target goal. Their website and</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SWarpDynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Facebook</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;pages show only incremental advancements since. Interestingly, the</span><a href="http://paresspacewarpresearch.org/2019/03/27/space-warp-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;company’s website notes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that Pares was “Inspired by his own craft sighting, at the age of 16,” although no other details of this sighting are provided. Apart from that, little is known about this project.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysis: The New 2020 Warp Drive Patent</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April of 2020, two engineers from Chicago, Jessica Gallanis and Eytan Halm Suchard</span><a href="https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2020/0130870.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;published a patent application</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for a drive using the updated Harold White designs. A device aptly named the Alcubierre-White Warp Drive. Barely a month into the COVID 19 shutdown, the patent’s publication seemed to sneak under the radar, with a</span><a href="http://readmultiplex.com/2020/12/22/patent-application-alcubierre-white-warp-drive-machine/?fbclid=IwAR0_vLd_-oFPI7Fql4zjMBRX0kt3k6yAjg_sSLU48vg7UXBcZAGlkFu2XcM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;lone report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Read Multiplex</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in December of 2020 (one that sits behind a paywall).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the summary portion of the patent, Gallanis and Suchard explain how “the invention uses two Alcubierre gravitational walls to achieve a warp drive effect as means of propulsion while surrounding or enclosing a cavity or space where passengers can travel.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This design is consistent with Alcubierre, who’s solution they point out “suggested a method for changing the metric of space-time and creating a space-time warp bubble such that while from outside the bubble, the bubble can advance in superluminal speed, from within the bubble the speed is much lower than the speed of light.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patent also notes the work of Froning, who they say observed how, “if sufficient warping is achieved, ship speed is slower than light speed within the region that surrounds it-even if it is moving faster-than-light with respect to Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I had never personally heard of the Alcubierre drive until 2013,” Suchard admitted on a two-hour telephone interview with&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief to&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">discuss his device, how the design came about, and how realistic building his patented Warp Drive was.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A software engineer by trade, Suchard was working on handwriting and signature recognition software when he had a revelation that would lead to his patented design.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“It occurred to me that we should be able to describe all physical phenomena as geometry. And that space-time was merely an emergent property, which is diametrically opposed to [Albert] Einstein’s approach.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Israeli-born engineer said this revelation launched him into a more in-depth study of things like dark matter, loop theory, quantum gravity, and ultimately, to the idea of a warp drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I first stumbled across Alcubierre in 2013,” Suchard explained, a discovery that led to him spending the next three years trying to rectify his new take on classical physics with Dr. White’s theory. “I knew from my own calculations that energy itself must create gravity, and by extension anti-gravity,” he said. “And that this had to be the solution to Alcubierre.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By 2017, Suchard’s wife and fellow engineer Jessica Gallanis told him that his theoretical work was sound, and it was time to try to file a patent. Unfortunately, the first try was unsuccessful. “They wouldn’t take it,” he said of the response by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">United States Patent and Trademark Office</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(USPTO). “I think they didn’t understand the physics.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suchard said he spent the next two years going back and forth with the USPTO until, in 2020, they finally made a concession. “By then, they did not refute the fact that the patent is based upon a valid working theory, but still said I would need a physical device to prove the physics.” As a result of this concession, they accepted the application, leading to the 2020 publication.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Outlook: Has History Been Made?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked where his patent will go from here, Suchard was particularly critical in his response. “I don’t trust anyone else to do the experiments,” he said, “because too many do them in the wrong way.” To do those experiments, Suchard also admits that his expertise is not enough. “I would need other physicists involved. An RF engineer, a materials scientist, and many others with expertise in [areas like] heat dissipation, x-rays, and other related fields.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;reached out to Dr. Jason Cassibry, a professor at the Propulsion Research Center at the University of Alabama Huntsville. He, and one of his students,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywaxeb/this-student-is-one-of-the-top-scientists-studying-faster-than-light-warp-drives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Joseph Agnew</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a researcher at the Propulsion Research Center, explained that there were problems with Suchard’s theory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cassibry and Agnew told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in an email that the use of highly concentrated magnetic fields to create gravity wells is a common aspect of warp drive theory.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’ve seen a number of people try to relate high-frequency electrical oscillations to warp drive. Based on some of the papers I’ve looked at, there is indeed a relation between highly concentrated magnetic field energy, like in a huge solenoid, and a positive gravity well. But the amount of energy required to be detectable is quite large, and, although doable, that experiment has not been run yet,” Agnew explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Agnew explained that the biggest problem is the “‘negative energy or ‘anti-gravity well'” part of the system that makes it an Alcubierre drive and not just a gravity well. Both Agnew and Cassibry concurred that aspects of the patent did jive with previous warp drive models; however, since there was no experimental data, it would be impossible to determine if the drive would work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m skeptical,” Agnew stated, “since it cites as-yet-unobserved phenomena as its basis for operation.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Cassibry echoed Agnew’s sentiment, adding, “I hope that someday, someone discloses an invention or a technology along with a demonstration of a real system, such as a video of a working propulsion system lifting itself off the ground, no strings attached. Short of that, experimental measurements, even on a subscale test, are highly valuable and encouraged. Short of experimental evidence, I will remain skeptical of any and all papers and patents.”</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached out to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NASA Ames Research Center</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for comment from Dr. White on this potentially groundbreaking patent and any work he may still be doing in this field. Their representative told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that White retired from the organization last year. They also indicated that the warp mechanics program he ran at Ames is no longer in operation as it was shuttered at the same time he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;tried to contact Dr. Whte at his new venture, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.limitlessspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Limitless Space Institute</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which appears to be continuing his Warp Drive research. They did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patent by Suchard and Gallanis is still awaiting approval, and it is an approval Suchard is not expecting any time soon. Still, he says, the theory is sound, and if he were able to put together the team of experts he envisions, he thinks building a warp drive may be possible. Like most potential breakthrough propulsion theories, Suchard’s take on energy and gravity is unique. Still, unlike Alcubierre and White, he has taken that theory to the next step with an actual patent application. Time will tell if it ever leads to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/no-china-did-not-build-a-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">real thing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, but the work by other researchers in the field and the improvements to Alcubierre’s original theory made along the way may mean that warp speed may be closer than we think.</span></p>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window

<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

March 3, 2021 | https://blog.min.io/object_storage_as_a_service_on_minio/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.min.io/object_storage_as_a_service_on_minio/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>Object storage as a service is the hottest concept in storage today. The reason is straightforward: object storage is the storage class of the cloud and the ability to provision it seamlessly to applications or developers makes it immensely valuable to enterprises of any size. <br></p><p>The challenge is that object storage as a service has traditionally been very difficult to deliver. Overly complex, hard to tune for performance, prone to failure at scale etc. While systems like Kubernetes offer powerful tools for automating the deployment and management of these systems, the overall problem of <em>complexity</em> remains unsolved as administrators must still invest significant time and effort to deploy even a small scale object storage resource.<br></p><p>By combining Kubernetes with our new Operator and our Operator Console graphical user interface, MinIO is changing that dynamic in a big way. It should be stated upfront that MinIO has always obsessed over simplicity. It permeates everything we do, every design decision we make, every line of code we write.</p><p>Nonetheless, we saw even more opportunity for simplification. To do this we created the MinIO Operator and the MinIO kubectl plugin to facilitate the deployment and management of MinIO Object Storage on Kubernetes. While the Operator commands were critical for users already proficient with Kubernetes, we also wanted to address a wider audience so we created a Graphical User Interface for the Operator and incorporated it into our new MinIO Operator Console to enable anyone in the organization to create, deploy and manage object storage as a service.</p><p>Kubernetes is the platform of the Internet. Given its massive adoption, we chose to remain consistent with the Kubernetes way of doing things. This meant not using any specialized tools or services to setup MinIO. <br></p><p>The effect is that the MinIO Operator works on any Kubernetes distribution, be it OpenShift, vSphere 7.0u1, Rancher or stock upstream. Further, MinIO will work on any public cloud provider such as Amazon's EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Engine), Google's GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), Google's Anthos or Azure's AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). <br></p><p>Pretty much all you need to get started on any distribution of Kubernetes is some storage device that can be presented to Kubernetes either via Local Persistent Volumes or with a CSI Driver.<br></p><p>Let’s start with a review on using MinIO with the kubectl plugin and a kustomize based approach. You'll need to install the kubectl tool on a computer with network access to the Kubernetes cluster. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Install and Set Up kubectl</a> for installation instructions.

<p>A few days ago I obtained a malfunctioning dive computer along with some other SCUBA gear and decided to do another teardown. This one proved a bit more interesting since none of the chips were blobbed over. (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown">previous teardown</a> of a Genesis ReSource dive computer.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/pdfs/versa_pro_manual.pdf">Versa Pro Manual</a></p>

<h4 id="teardown">Teardown</h4>

<p>First step, remove the battery. It turns out the hard plastic cover with the copper layers both provides the surface for the o-ring to fit around, and is a piezo buzzer/speaker (more about that later).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-1.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The outer metal covering pops off easily with a small flathead screwdriver to pry the clips apart. The grey plastic ring underneath just slides off.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-2.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>With that, the plastic covering the LCD screen comes right out, along with the o-ring.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-3.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>And now the screen/circuit board module lifts out. You can see all the little springs which connect the circuit up to the external contacts.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-4.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The screen unclips from the circuit board with three little tabs.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-5.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The LCD itself is in the lower left. The polywELD object in the upper left is an electro-luminescent (EL) light which forms the backlight. In the upper right corner you can see two pieces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomeric_connector">zebra connector</a> which connect the LCD screen (the long piece) and the EL light (the short piece) to the circuit board.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-6.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h4 id="the-circuit">The Circuit</h4>

<p>Below you can see labels for all the main components of the circuit. Most of these will be discussed in more detail further down this post.</p>

<p>A closeup to show the text on the EEPROM chip.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/eeprom.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The reverse side of the PCB. Note the pads which connect to the springs I pointed out before.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/bottomside-labeled.png" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="pressure-sensor">Pressure Sensor</h5>

<p>The pressure sensor was giving bad readings according to the error the computer showed. Since the computer is from circa 2003, the manufacturer doesn’t service this model anymore, so no point in being non-destructive.</p>

<p>This is tiny module underneath the black protective goop inside the pressure sensor. It measures 1.5mm x 1.5mm x 0.9mm.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/sensor-0.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>And this is the module under a microscope. You can see the locations the bond wires connected before I broke them by pulling it out of the housing.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/sensor-1.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/sensor-2.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>There is definitely some 3-dimensionality to this module. From doing some reading I believe it is a Wheatstone bridge composed of piezo-resistive elements. There is probably a sealed chamber inside for use as a reference pressure. The output signal is a differential analog voltage which goes off to an  opamp circuit to prepare a signal which can be measured by the ADC in the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Update: I emailed SMI and asked if they could identify the sensor, and they responded a few hours later that it was the SM5106. In the snippets from the datasheet shown below, you can see that it is indeed a Wheatstone bridge composed of four piezoresistive elements.</p>

<p>The circuit below conditions the signal coming from the sensor, preparing it to be read by the ADC. It is composed of four opamps and various passives.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/opamp-circuit.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>As shown in the schematic below, opamp C creates a constant current source pushing 330 uA through the Wheatstone bridge. Opamp D is just a buffer. Opamps A and B form something similar to an instrumentation amplifier, but not quite the standard configuration. The net result is that if the voltage at the non-inverting inputs of opamps A and B is identical, then the output of B will be 30 mV. If the voltage at the non-inverting input of A is higher than at the non-inverting input of B, then the voltage on the output of B will go up. In the reverse situation the voltage will go down, though of course it bottoms out pretty quickly at zero. I suspect the sensor is setup so this situation should never happen.</p>

<p>The output voltage which would be read by the microcontroller can be found using the equation show below. \(V_{A-} \) and \(V_{B-}\) are the voltages at the inverting inputs of opamps A and B. Since they are setup with negative feedback, these will equal the voltages at their non-inverting inputs AKA the voltages from the sense terminals on the Wheatstone bridge.</p>

<p>\( V_{out} = (3\frac{96e3}{26e3}+1)(\Delta V) + 0.03 \) where \( \Delta V = V_{A-} - V_{B-} \)</p>

<p>or approximately</p>

<p>\( V_{out} = (12)(\Delta V) + 0.03 \)</p>

<h5 id="backlight">Backlight</h5>

<p>The backlight consists of an electro-luminescent (EL) panel shaped to exactly match the LCD. EL panels are a capacitive load (this one measures about 6 nF) which need to be driven by a high voltage AC signal, typically 150 Vpp or more. The IC shown in the circuit diagram below is specifically designed to drive EL lights. It uses the inductor to generate very large voltage spikes at a frequency controlled by a clock signal from the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Below you can see the panel glowing. I have it connected to a stand-alone EL driver I have for use with EL wire.</p>

<p><br>

<br></p>

<h5 id="speaker-buzzer">Speaker/Buzzer</h5>

<p>I found this circuit especially interesting to understand, since I didn’t realize at first that the back disk behaved as a buzzer. For a while I was thinking that it might be a way to detect the intrusion of water to the battery compartment.</p>

<p>The buzzer consists of two copper plates separated by a small distance. The smaller plate is connected directly to the positive terminal of the battery. Why the positive terminal and not the negative “ground” terminal? I’m pretty sure just because it was more physically convenient, and whether that plate is held at “zero” or at three volts is irrelevant compared to the large voltages on the other plate.</p>

<p>The IC marked ACCM in the circuit below is a simple capacitive charge pump style voltage doubler (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/charge-pump/">post</a> about building an inverting charge pump for more info on how these work). When transistor Q2 is turned on (by pulling the GPIO to ground) Node 2 gets connected to Vcc. This turns on the LED and provides the input voltage for the voltage doubler. Pin 2 is then at 6 volts (Vcc * 2).</p>

<p>The fun comes when Q1 is alternately turned on and off by a PWM signal from the microcontroller. When Node 1 is pulled to ground through the transistor, the inductor behaves like a simple wire (in the steady state). But, when the transistor is turned off, current through the inductor attempts to stop instantly and the collapsing magnetic field creates an induced current in the same direction but now this current has no where to go. The result is a large voltage spike at Node 1 which means a large potential difference across the capacitive load (about 12.3 nF) formed by the buzzer. This built up charge then goes back through the inductor resulting in an oscillation which is stopped when the transistor turns back on, pulling Node 1 back to ground.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/pdfs/MAX1683_voltage_doubler_datasheet.pdf">Voltage Doubler Datasheet</a></p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/speaker-schematic.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The lower (yellow) trace is the approx 40% +duty cycle PWM signal from the microcontroller. The upper (blue) trace is the voltage at Node 1. The approx 40 volt peak-to-peak oscillation results in the buzzer vibrating at 2.5 kHz (plus harmonics).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/speaker-scope.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="lcd-voltage-generation">LCD Voltage Generation</h5>

<p>The LCD requires a few different voltages to operate. I couldn’t find a datasheet for the IC marked “MCAB P358” but the purpose is to generate the one third and two thirds Vcc voltages for the LCD driver IC. (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/lcd-screen/">post</a> reverse engineering an LCD screen for more info on why these voltages are needed.)</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/P358-schematic.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="light-sensor">Light Sensor</h5>

<p>The component beside the LED is (as far as I can tell) a photo-transistor which is used to sense the ambient light levels. The computer manual says it uses this information to only turn on the backlight above water if the computer is in a low light situation. This way battery isn’t wasted lighting up the screen when it isn’t needed. In low light the sense GPIO will remain high, pulled to Vcc by the resistor. In bright light the transistor will turn on, pulling the sense GPIO pin to ground. I suspect that other than for the moment when the microcontroller is checking the light level, both GPIO pins are tri-stated to save power.</p>

    <h2>A Terse Guide on Hiring Your First Engineering Manager</h2>
  </div><div>
    <p>Hiring an early-stage manager can bring up powerful fears of making a bad hire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What if they ruin our culture?</li>
  <li>What if we lose good people because of them?</li>
  <li>What if they cause harm?</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>This mindset can lead to fear-driven-development of the job description. The “what-ifs” turn into a laundry list of requirements without much coherence between them, and this leads to stressful hiring experience both for the candidate (who feels like they need to be superhero to succeed) and for the folks doing the hiring (who feel like they might never find the right person.)</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-manager">What Makes A Manager?</h2>

<p>When it comes to defining a manager’s role, I encourage people to start with a simple baseline: Look for someone who is effective at <em>performance management.</em></p>

<p>That term might make you cringe depending on your experience. However, <a href="https://www.alancolquitt.com/book">modern performance management</a> is quite a bit different than the discipline that spawned the term decades ago.</p>

<p>This is a whole topic in its own right, but for our purposes, let’s define performance management as “bringing people and resources together to make the right things happen.” It’s simple, but it’s hard!</p>

<p><em>TL;DR The baseline for an effective manager is that they can lead their teams in getting from “why” to “what” to “how”</em>.</p>

<p>An effective performance manager has competency in three areas:</p>

<h3 id="direction">Direction</h3>

<p>They understand and contribute to the company’s strategy at an appropriate level.</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See it as their job to understand and represent what the business is doing (in their area, at least)</li>
  <li>Help their reports and peers to understand that direction for themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seeing their job as “protecting” their team from “the business”</li>
  <li>Talking about “the business” like a foreign entity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>They can lead their team from “why are we doing this?” to “what are we doing?”</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead teams in designing solutions to problems</li>
  <li>Contribute well as peers with other disciplines (product management, design, etc.)</li>
  <li>Effectively guide people through conflict as it arises</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viewing their teams as “order-takers” for product management / design / etc</li>
  <li>A need to control rather than influence (e.g. requiring direct reporting lines to any area where they need to get things done)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>They get results. This means going from “what are we doing?” to “we’re doing it!”</p>

<p>More specifically, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the right things done</li>
  <li>Use simple, understandable measurements to know that the right things are getting done</li>
  <li>Continually grow and resource their team</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogmatic belief in a particular project-management process</li>
  <li>Shying away from taking ownership of outcomes</li>
  <li>Can’t hold multiple priorities in balance with one another (e.g. treats people terribly to get results, or sacrifices results to treat people too gently)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this">How Do I Use This?</h2>

<p>Starting with this short list of capabilities, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a couple of other things that are important to the job (e.g. technical skills)</li>
  <li>Use the list of capabilities you came up with to write the job description</li>
  <li>Build an interview to test for these things</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for more detail, <a href="https://mikedebo.com/work/2020/11/06/hacking-structured-interviewing-for-jobs-you-dont-understand/">I wrote a guide on hiring for jobs you don’t understand well</a> that should help you put it all together.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="q-why-isnt-there-a-communication-section-isnt-that-an-important-skill-for-a-manager">Q: Why isn’t there a “Communication” section? Isn’t that an important skill for a manager?</h3>

<p>It is common to test for communication directly. However, I don’t think it’s specific enough.</p>

<p>Think for a moment: Have you worked with a manager who was great at communicating with other engineering teams, but struggled in group sessions with product management, design, marketing, or other roles?</p>

<p>How about someone who was great at storytelling, but who had a hard time communicating how to turn that idea into reality?</p>

<p>These are all different types of communication, but they happen in different contexts.</p>

<p>The person who does well with their teams but poorly with product and design may be more comfortable with <em>making progress</em> than with <em>creating alignment.</em> Our storyteller may be great at communicating <em>direction</em> but not so good with the rest.</p>

<p>None of these gaps are necessarily deal-breakers on their own, but they do paint a clearer picture of where manager’s strengths might lie, and this extra specificity might help you make a better hiring decision.</p>

<h3 id="q-this-directionalignmentprogress-stuff-sounds-a-bit-fluffy-arent-there-better-words-for-it">Q: This direction/alignment/progress stuff sounds a bit fluffy. Aren’t there better words for it?</h3>

<p>I tend not to use these directly with folks unless I’m explaining the underlying model. When talking about it with everyone else, you can use something like “Strategy”, “Focus”, “Execution”; or, even more simply, “Why”, “What”, and “How”.</p>

<h3 id="q-you-havent-spoken-about-leadership-at-all-arent-leadership-qualities-important-in-a-manager">Q: You haven’t spoken about leadership at all. Aren’t leadership qualities important in a manager?</h3>

<p>This is a big topic. In short, my experience is this: It takes a lot of experience and pain to become a strong leader. There are some really interesting, deeply-thought-out leadership programs out there (e.g. <a href="https://coactive.com/training/leadership-training/">Co-Active Leadership</a>) but even those will push their trainees into different forms of suffering to develop their character.</p>

<p>Performance management, however, is a pretty distinct set of skills that can be learned quickly with some dedication. I think it’s a lot more reasonable to find someone who has these skills (or who can develop them on the job) than to expect them to have a lot of difficult-to-acquire leadership qualities, especially for front-line managers who tend to be earlier in their careers.</p>

<h2 id="need-help">Need Help?</h2>

<p>I like talking about hiring. Ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedeb0">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-dibernardo-5b19189/">LinkedIn</a> if you’d like to chat.</p>

If you don't have time, I've got you covered on the basics.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What the heck is Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. Here's a <a href="https://www.kidsnews.com.au/money/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-how-does-it-work-in-the-digital-world/news-story/7f8105dbed5eb13916b379fab8b6c437" target="_blank">cryptocurrency explainer for kids</a> (I needed it), but the basic idea is that it's a secure, verifiable, digital alternative to cash money.</p><p><br>All you need to know for today is that the "verifiable" part of crypto is what makes it relevant to sustainability.</p><p><br><strong>Why does it matter to climate change?</strong></p><div><p>You acquire Bitcoin by "mining" it digitally. Let's use gold as an example — gold miners had to expend time, money, and energy to find and extract hidden nuggets.</p><p>Now lets imagine that the tools used to mine and verify the legitimacy of the gold consumed more power than your house, and the more gold you mined, the harder your miners had to work, and the more energy they consumed.</p><p>Bitcoin matters to climate change because it consumes a huge amount of energy, and the energy per transaction will continue to increase.</p></div><p><br><strong>How bad is it, really?</strong></p><p>From the sources above and a few more linked, here are some quick facts:</p><ul role="list"><li>A single Bitcoin transaction expends enough electricity to power the average US home for three weeks (<a href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/tuesday-thread-air-travel-bitcoin/comments" target="_blank">The Phoenix</a>/<a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Digiconomist</a>)</li><li>In Iceland more energy is likely used mining Bitcoin than for combined household use (<a href="https://fortune.com/2018/02/13/iceland-bitcoin-mining-electricity/" target="_blank">Fortune</a>)</li><li>Most electricity used to mine Bitcoin comes from fossil fuels, Bitcoin produces 37 million tons of carbon dioxide annually (same as the country of Switzerland) (<a href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-now-worth-50000-and-its" target="_blank">The Phoenix</a>)</li><li>If Bitcoin was a country, it would be in the top 30 energy users. It's exceeded Argentina - yikes</li><li>The top 0.01% holders of Bitcoin have 22x the combined Bitcoins as all the rest of us combined — it could be a bad income inequality multiplier (<a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/1363134206671532033" target="_blank">Eric Holthaus &amp; Bitinfocharts</a>)</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6db441319a46c10ca23b4d/603f6c4805d50a043f412fc5_fec4e604-5817-4795-ad41-e03d0f1d4933.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><br><strong>Is it all bad?</strong></p><div><p>I'm honestly still grappling with this, but the most compelling argument in favor of Bitcoin is that people want to make money off of it, existing energy is too expensive, so it incentivizes the production of solar energy. I'll share sources when I find something more credible than <a href="https://medium.com/@philgeiger/bitcoin-is-good-for-the-environment-fc5ff7448b9e" target="_blank">blog posts</a>.</p><p>My take (for now) is that Bitcoin is net negative, but there are so many other types of cryptocurrency like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> acknowledging the planetary impacts of crypto technology and surfacing solutions. I need to learn more about why people are obsessed with Bitcoin and only Bitcoin when it seems like there are "better" cryptos out there.

<p>How much RAM on your laptop is sitting unused?  How much is empty?  How much is redundant?</p>

<p>In an ideal OS, the answer is none.  All RAM contains data of running programs, or buffers or cache to help speed up things you’re about to do.</p>

<p>But what about reality?   A quick <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hello1024/4902ff3bdba32a219adb4caa3563c23a">bit of python</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/Hello1024/devmem-full-access">a kernel module</a> later, and I now know!</p>

<p>System: Ubuntu 20.10 laptop, with 16 Gigs of RAM, running Chrome with +20 tabs, playing a bit of music and running a few other apps (Freecad, Deluge, Sublime).  Pretty typical desktop workload.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results…</h3>

<p>Of my 15.7 Gigs of RAM…   2.05 Gigs are exact duplicates of other memory (1.1Gigs of that are zeros), and 13.6 Gigs are unique.</p>

<h3 id="how-frequent-are-the-duplicates">How frequent are the duplicates?</h3>

<p><img src="https://omattos.com/images/dupemem-freqplot.png" alt="Frequency plot"></p>

<h3 id="what-data-has-the-most-duplicates">What data has the most duplicates?</h3>

<p>The most common are all zeros, all <code>0xff</code>’s, all <code>0xcc</code>’s (used by some memory debuggers?), and various patterns that I suspect are freelists of various memory allocators.</p>

<p>Lets take a look at the 4k page of RAM with hash 0372a15ebe749b18d397c9dffdc55d21.  There are 5 copies of it.  The actual data is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gBFACQAJYAUgBUAC2AF4AYwA...lots more base64...A;gdpr=1;dc_adk=4100875739;ord=r2qk1l;click=https%3A%2F%2Fclicktrack.pubmatic.com%2FAdServer%2FAdDisplayTrackerSer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So it’s a bit of a cookie.   Is it a good use of RAM to keep 5 copies?</p>

<h3 id="what-about-free-memory">What about free memory?</h3>

<p>This system claims:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># free
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:       16153824     5098156     5662776      893616     5392892     9826072
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most of those ‘free’ pages contain data from previous programs, and is counted in the above analysis.   Quite why we have so much free memory when we could be preloading potentially useful data is another question…</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>My RAM has a lot of duplicate data in.  This seems counter to good design practices which should keep just one copy of big chunks of identical data.   Anyone fancy running the same code on their system, tracking down who is copying and allocating this data, and sending patches to the relevant projects to keep just one copy of this data and allow the RAM to be used for better things?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives, so there are parallels between the two open source projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Nearly 3 out of 4 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from loss of memory, attention or concentration. This range of cognitive deficiencies referred to as chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, chemobrain or chemofog severely hampers quality of life of patients undergoing treatment. Advanced neuroimaging analyses have identified structural white and gray matter damage following chemotherapy in patients treated for various types of cancer. Cognitive deficits associated with platinum-based therapeutics such as cisplatin have been observed for 5-10 years post-diagnosis. However, no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic interventions are available to date.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by abnormal morphology, impaired bioenergetics, altered mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial DNA mutations, has emerged as an underlying mechanism of several pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral and cardiac ischemia , traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cancer, and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy. Following cerebral ischemia, astrocytes donate their healthy mitochondria to ischemic neurons with dysfunctional mitochondria to maintain adequate mitochondrial function and survival.</p>

<p>Studies in the 1930s already showed that nasally administered bacteria can cross the nasal epithelium within minutes, indicating a paracellular route of entry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847685/">In a recent study</a>, Jenolyn F. Alexander, Cobi J. Heijnen and colleagues demonstrated that nasal administration of mesenchymal stem cells restores cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment in mice and their data indicated that these mesenchymal stem cells act by repairing neuronal mitochondrial damage. 
<img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847685/bin/thnov11p3109g001.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>It appeared that autologous mesenchymal stem cells work as well as human mesenchymal stem cells in their mouse model. The concept of mitochondrial administration is also being considered the treatment of Parkinson's disease, cerebral and cardiac ischemia, cancer, diabetic nephropathy and spinal cord injuries  and some clinical trials for evaluating the safety and efficacy of isolated mitochondria based therapies have also recently commenced.</p>

<p>These findings indicate that cisplatin-induced accumulation of mitochondrial p53 is the cause of the damage to brain mitochondria that leads to cognitive deficits in response to treatment with this chemotherapeutic. The authors recently showed that astrocytes donate their healthy mitochondria and rescue primary cortical neurons damaged by cisplatin in vitro.</p>

<p>Based on their above-mentioned findings that mitochondrial deficits underlie cisplatin-induced neuronal damage and cognitive deficits, and that healthy mitochondria can be taken up by damaged neurons, the scientists hypothesized that isolated mitochondria from healthy mesenchymal stem cells can be used to resolve cisplatin-induced cognitive deficits and the associated structural damage. This would provide an advantage from the perspective of safety because the scientists do not need donation of allogeneic intact cells.</p>

<p>Mice were intraperitoneally injected with cisplatin at 2.3 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days, followed by 5 days of rest and another 5 days of cisplatin injection. The two administrations of mitochondria on mice delivered nasally, completely restored within two weeks mice's executive functioning, spatial recognition and working memory previously impaired by cisplatin treatment. The entry of mesenchymal stem cells into the brain is facilitated by pretreatment of the nasal cavity with hyaluronidase. The scientists maintained the mitochondria in calcium-free mitochondrial respiration buffer until ready for nasal delivery when they were transferred to calcium-free PBS.</p>

<p>Within 30 min of nasal administration, the mitochondria were detectable in the meninges where they were predominantly internalized by macrophages. Within this 30 min, the mitochondria also arrived at the ventricles and choroid plexus, gaining access to the brain.</p>

<p>3 h after delivery, mitochondria were found distributed along the rostral migratory stream where they were internalized by GFAP+ cells. By this time the nasally administered mitochondria also reached the hippocampus. Evidently, these mitochondria that had entered the meninges and brain completely restored the cisplatin-induced white matter damage in the cingulate cortex, synaptic loss in the hippocampus, and the compromised synaptosome membrane integrity and structural mitochondrial defects in synaptosomes as observed 35 days after the second mitochondrial donation.</p>

<p>The scientists used mitochondria isolated from human mesenchymal stem cells in their mouse model for the primary purpose of being able to trace the administered mitochondria with a human-specific mitochondrial antibody.</p>

<p>One topic of concern usually raised with the administration of isolated mitochondria is the possibility that they may function as damage-associated molecular proteins (DAMPs) which could lead to neuroinflammation. However, the scientists did not see activation of inflammatory pathways in the hippocampal transcriptome using human mitochondria. Mitochondria lack many surface antigens including HLA-Class 1 antigens thereby exhibiting lower immunogenicity than mesenchymal stem cells. This is one advantage favoring the clinical translation of allogeneic donation of mitochondria over mesenchymal stem cells.</p>

<p>An important benefit of their approach is the nasal route of delivery. In case of central nervous system (CNS)-targeted delivery of therapeutics, intracranial administration poses serious risk of injury. Intravenous administration has the disadvantage that it may lead to accumulation in the lung and liver requiring high doses which may generate inflammatory reactions or other adverse effects. Systemic administration of therapeutics intended to reach the brain are also obstructed by the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers. In contrast, the nasal route of delivery is simple, non-invasive and facilitates the delivery of therapeutics to the brain thereby reducing the amount of mitochondria required.</p>

<p>Questions are raised on the ability of isolated mitochondria to survive in high extracellular calcium levels upon administration and to generate sufficient energy to enter cells and continue to function after cellular uptake. Upon internalization, mitochondrial donation enhanced the bioenergetics of the damaged cells for at least 21 days.</p>

<p>It is still unknown how donated mitochondria repair damaged neuronal cells. Interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes are vital for fundamental cellular processes such as respiration, transcription and translation. The authors observed that the internalized mitochondria, in many instances were localized close to the nucleus (perinuclear), as if communicating with them. In the literature it has been suggested that donated mitochondria can fuse with mitochondria of damaged recipient cells and thereby repair the bioenergetic machinery or replenish mitochondrial DNA in the acceptor cell.</p>

<p>Although this might be true, it remains difficult to accept that the few mesenchymal stem cells-derived mitochondria can restore cellular respiration by physical fusion to the many acceptor cell mitochondria. It is more likely that the donated mitochondria activate a transcriptional program leading to enhanced Nrf2 signaling and subsequent recovery of host mitochondrial function by a host of antioxidants.</p>

<p>Their findings elucidate the therapeutic effects of nasally delivered mitochondria to resolve unmet needs in the treatment of cancer survivors with neurotoxicities and highlights its potential significance for clinical translation. It also provides promise for treatment of a range of cognitive and neuronal deficits warranting further investigation in large animal models.</p>

<p>A good archer is not known by his arrows but his aim</p>
<p>Thomas Fuller</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t know about you, folks, but I had a hard time remembering all the Haskell arrows that you can bump into in all different situations. For example, I guess I will never be able to use <code>ViewPatterns</code> correctly on the first attempt. For me, the digest of every use case of each arrow in Haskell sounds like a handy thing to have, at least this information will be structured somewhere, so here we go.</p>
<p>Each section of this post covers a specific arrow application, explains when and how it is used and gives examples. Some not that popular usages of the arrow syntax are mentioned in this writing too. So, if you are excited, let’s get started!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/posts/arrows/arrows-blue-knight.jpg" alt="Arrows Blue Knight">
</figure>
<h2 id="section">-&gt;<a href="#section">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The most frequently used arrow in Haskell – right-directed arrow <code>-&gt;</code> – is the one we are going to talk about first and foremost.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types<a href="#types">🔗</a></h3>
<p><code>-&gt;</code> is used in the type signatures to show the relation of types in functions. When just starting learning Haskell, we can think of this arrow as an indicator in the type. But later, we can figure out, that in reality, <code>-&gt;</code> is the built-in data type specified in the <code>GHC.Prim</code> module:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>data</span> (<span>-&gt;</span>) a b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The arrow type operator is usually used in the infix form. It shows the direction from input to output type of functions.</p>
<p>For instance, we say that the standard <code>length</code> function takes a list and returns a single integer – the list’s size. With the arrow, it is written in the type like this:</p>

<p>We can use function type when defining a new data type:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>ReaderT</span> r m a <span>=</span> <span>ReaderT</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">    {<span> runReaderT ::</span> r <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example of where you can use <code>-&gt;</code> as a type operator is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/gadt.html">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>Literal</span><span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>Const</span><span> ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">    <span>BinOperation</span><span> ::</span> <span>BinOp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">    <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="kinds">Kinds<a href="#kinds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Like type signatures for functions and data types, we also use <code>-&gt;</code> to specify the kinds of the types (aka types of the types).</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/kind_signatures.html#extension-KindSignatures">KindSignatures</a> extensions, we can specify the kind for the type variables:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>data</span> <span>IntBox</span> (<span>f ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>IntBox</span> (f <span>Int</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the relatively new GHC extension – <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/poly_kinds.html#extension-StandaloneKindSignatures">StandaloneKindSignatures</a>, which was added in GHC-8.10, we can specify the <strong>kind</strong> of the type similar to the way we do it for functions’ types:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Pair</span><span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>data</span> <span>Pair</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Pair</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Right-directed arrow is also used in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/type_families.html">type families</a> declarations:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> <span>AllHave</span> (<span>f ::</span> k <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Constraint</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> <span>Constraint</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">    <span>AllHave</span> _ '[]       <span>=</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb7-3">    <span>AllHave</span> f (x '<span>:</span> xs) <span>=</span> (f x, <span>AllHave</span> f xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="lambda-function">Lambda function<a href="#lambda-function">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The syntax for lambda functions in Haskell uses the right arrow <code>-&gt;</code> but on the term-level and not type-level as in the previous use-case. The general scheme is the following:</p>
<pre><code>\variables with spaces (or patterns in parenthesis) -&gt; action with variables</code></pre>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>doubleList ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]</span>
<span id="cb9-2">doubleList <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\x <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>*</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4">foldl' (\hash el <span>-&gt;</span> HashSet.insert el hash) <span>mempty</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>ifM ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb9-7">ifM p x y <span>=</span> p <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>if</span> b <span>then</span> x <span>else</span> y</span>
<span id="cb9-8"></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><span>heads ::</span> [<span>NonEmpty</span> a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb9-10">heads <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\(x <span>:|</span> _) <span>-&gt;</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cases">Cases<a href="#cases">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>Case of</strong></p>
<p>In addition to pattern matching in the function declaration, you can also use the <strong>case-of</strong> expression. The main difference between the case-of and top-level pattern matching is that <code>case</code> uses arrows <code>-&gt;</code> instead of <code>=</code> for branch results.</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>whenJust ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f ()) <span>-&gt;</span> f ()</span>
<span id="cb10-2">whenJust ma f <span>=</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3">    <span>Just</span> x  <span>-&gt;</span> f x</span>
<span id="cb10-4">    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda case</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the <em>case-of</em> expression, <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/lambda_case.html#extension-LambdaCase"><strong>lambda case</strong></a> is used to reduce syntax noise when using the case construction on the last argument in lambda functions.</p>
<p>The most common case is to use it on the last input argument in the functions:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>isEmpty ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2">isEmpty <span>=</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">    [] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">    _  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Case guards</strong></p>
<p>Just like <em>guards</em> in normal functions, you can use guards with cases as well in the same manner, but keeping the syntax of the <em>case-of</em> with <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>maybeAddEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">maybeAddEven ma mb <span>=</span> <span>case</span> (ma, mb) <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">    (<span>Just</span> a, <span>Just</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">        <span>|</span> <span>even</span> a <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>even</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> a <span>+</span> b</span>
<span id="cb12-5">        <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">    (_, _) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda Case* </strong></p>
<p>Additionally, since GHC 9.0.1, combining <code>LambdaCase</code> with <code>Arrows</code> allows the <code>\case</code> syntax to be used as a command in the <code>proc</code> notation:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">proc x <span>-&gt;</span> (f <span>-&lt;</span> x) <span>`catchA`</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">    p1 <span>-&gt;</span> cmd1</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">    pN <span>-&gt;</span> cmdN</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="view-patterns">View Patterns<a href="#view-patterns">🔗</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/view_patterns.html?highlight=viewpatterns#extension-ViewPatterns"><code>-XViewPatterns</code></a> is a handy extension that allows writing function application directly in the arguments specification. And, as you can guess, the <code>-&gt;</code> is part of its syntax too. First, you need to specify the function you want to apply and then, after the arrow, the variable that you can use later on in the function body. E.g.</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>mkUser ::</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2">mkUser (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> nickname) (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> name) <span>=</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3">    { userNickname <span>=</span> nickname</span>
<span id="cb14-4">    , userName <span>=</span> name</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use <code>ViewPatterns</code> with the concrete pattern, not the variable:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>startWithA ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2">startWithA (<span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'a'</span><span>:</span>_) <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3">startWithA _ <span>=</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Multiple <code>ViewPatterns</code> can be composed in a single pattern:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>maybeEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2">maybeEven (fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>even</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3">    <span>if</span> isEven</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>then</span> <span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>else</span> <span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The above is equivalent to the usage of ordinary function composition and a single view pattern:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">maybeEven (<span>even</span> <span>.</span> fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven)</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>15</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>"Other"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb18-6"><span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="multi-way-if">Multi-Way If<a href="#multi-way-if">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/multiway_if.html#extension-MultiWayIf"><code>MultiWayIf</code></a> extension allows writing <code>if-then-else</code> constructions with <em>guards</em> to check more conditions on the same level, and it also uses the right-directed arrow (-&gt;). Check this one out:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>choose ::</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb19-2">choose allowedStrs <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>if</span> <span>|</span> trim input <span>==</span> <span>""</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb19-5">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Empty input"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span>
<span id="cb19-6">       <span>|</span> <span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> input <span>`elem`</span> allowedStrs <span>-&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb19-9">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Choose wisely"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="linear-types">Linear types*<a href="#linear-types">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The brand new feature introduced in Haskell is <a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/linear_types.html"><strong>linear types</strong></a>. It only appeared in GHC-9.0 and is not yet that widespread, but it is nice to know that the arrow with the special syntax can represent linear types. The syntax is using <code>%m -&gt;</code> to specify the “linearity” of the function.</p>
<p>See the example of the <code>uncons</code> function, that consumes the input list only once (hence <code>%1</code>):</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>uncons ::</span> [a] <span>%</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (a, [a])</span>
<span id="cb20-2">uncons [] <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb20-3">uncons (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (x, xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="section-1">&lt;-<a href="#section-1">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Now, let’s see where the opposite-direction arrow <code>&lt;-</code> is used. It is also quite popular and has different use-cases, which is good to distinguish in order to understand and control your code better.</p>
<h3 id="do">Do<a href="#do">🔗</a></h3>
<p>One of the main syntactic Haskell features is <strong>“do” notation</strong>. Do-notation is an alternative for building up monadic computations, using a pseudo-imperative code writing style with the named variables. In reality, do-notation is the syntax-sugar for the binding that uses the left arrow <code>&lt;-</code> operator to assign the result of binding into the variable.</p>
<p>There are a few types of do-notations. We are going to check out each of them separately here.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Do-notation</strong></p>
<p>Any instance of the <code>Monad</code> class can be used in a traditional do-block in Haskell without any additional extension whatsoever.</p>
<p>The most conventional usage of do-notation is with the <code>IO</code> Monad:</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>main ::</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb21-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb21-4">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same as:</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1">main <span>=</span> <span>getLine</span> <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \input <span>-&gt;</span> putStrLin (input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how our new arrow <code>&lt;-</code> translates to the already familiar lambda-arrow <code>-&gt;</code> and the bind (<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do-notation could be written with any Monad: <code>Maybe</code>, <code>Either</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>State</code>, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: do not confuse <code>&lt;-</code> binding and <code>let =</code> expressions in the do-notation. <code>let =</code> is used for simple variable assignment, when <code>&lt;-</code> is used to assign the “binded” variable.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>main ::</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb23-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4">    <span>let</span> reversedInput <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> input</span>
<span id="cb23-5">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Reverse of what you wrote is "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> reversedInput</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Applicative-do</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/applicative_do.html">ApplicativeDo</a> is a GHC extension that allows using do-notation with the <code>Applicative</code> representers. Unlike monadic <code>do</code>, this one uses do-notation to syntax sugar <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operators of the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>Applicative-do is very useful for working with Applicative-based solutions, for example, with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> – Haskell parsing library:</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2"></span>
<span id="cb24-3"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb24-4">userParser <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb24-5">    userName <span>&lt;-</span> nameParser</span>
<span id="cb24-6">    userAge  <span>&lt;-</span> ageParser</span>
<span id="cb24-7">    <span>pure</span> (<span>User</span> userName userAge)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above becomes the syntax sugar for:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb25-2">userParser <span>=</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> nameParser <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> ageParser</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Recursive-do</strong></p>
<p><code>RecursiveDo</code> is yet another extension to strengthen do-notation. It allows recursive bindings that won’t work with the ordinary do-notation.</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"></span>
<span id="cb26-3"><span>data</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span> <span>Int</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-4"></span>
<span id="cb26-5"><span>mkNode ::</span>  <span>IO</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-6">mkNode <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb26-7">    rec nodeRef <span>&lt;-</span> newIORef (<span>Node</span> <span>0</span> nodeRef)</span>
<span id="cb26-8">    <span>return</span> nodeRef</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively to the <code>rec</code> keyword for the particular binding, <code>mdo</code> could be used instead of <code>do</code> to use recursive bindings on the whole block where GHC will cleverly apply it optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Qualified-Do</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/qualified_do.html?highlight=qualifieddo#extension-QualifiedDo">QualifiedDo</a> extension is the most recent addition to the compiler that became available only with the GHC version 9.0.</p>
<p>The feature allows you to customise the do-notation sugaring rules (you can use the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function defined in some modules in the qualified <code>do</code> blocks). You would then be able to specify qualified for each particular case you want to use it with.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a <code>List</code> module that would define binding functions:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>module</span> <span>List</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb27-2"></span>
<span id="cb27-3"><span>import</span> <span>Prelude</span> <span>hiding</span> (<span>Monad</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb27-4"></span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> [b]) <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6">(<span>&gt;&gt;=</span>) <span>=</span> <span>flip</span> <span>concatMap</span></span>
<span id="cb27-7"></span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>(&gt;&gt;) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb27-9">(<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> (<span>:</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can use it for the list do-notation:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>List</span></span>
<span id="cb28-4"></span>
<span id="cb28-5"><span>list ::</span> [<span>String</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-6">list <span>=</span> List.do</span>
<span id="cb28-7">    num <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>10</span>, <span>42</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-8">    <span>"Hello"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-9">    <span>"number"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-10">    <span>show</span> num</span>
<span id="cb28-11">    <span>"…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>A hash table is a data structure that stores a collection of key/value pairs in a way that makes it very efficient to find them again later.</p>



<p>Have you ever wanted to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the hash map, associative array or dictionary data structure in your language work?</li>
<li>When is it appropriate to use a hash table to store items?</li>
<li>How do we deal with ‘collisions’ in a hash table?</li>
</ul>



<p>Imagine we want to store a list of users so that we can find them later using their names.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/1.png" alt="Our users"></p>

<p>We could simply store our users in an array. When we need to find somebody later, we could loop through all of the users looking for a matching name.</p>

<p>That’s fine when we only have 3 users. If we had thousands, though, that would be quite slow. We can do better by using a  <strong>hash table</strong>.</p>

<p>A hash table stores items in a way that makes it much quicker to find them later, compared to looping through an array.</p>

<h2 id="creating-our-hash-table">Creating our hash table</h2>

<p>To use a hash table, we need a unique value for each user - this is our <strong>key</strong>. We’ll use this key to store the item, and to retrieve it later.</p>

<p>Because it makes a nice example, we’ll assume that each user has a unique name, and use that as our key. In practice, we would use something that is <em>guaranteed</em> to be unique like an ID.</p>

<p>A hash table works by storing items in <strong>buckets</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/2.png" alt="Hash table buckets"></p>

<p>Choosing the number of buckets is a topic in itself. For the sake of a simple example, we’ll use 4 buckets.</p>

<p>When we add a user to the hash table, we use their key to decide which bucket to store them in.</p>

<p>When we need to retrieve the user again, we can jump straight to the correct bucket to find them.. much quicker than checking every user in turn!</p>

<h2 id="storing-items-in-the-table">Storing items in the table</h2>

<p>Let’s store our first user, ‘Ada’.</p>

<p>Firstly, we need to decide which bucket to store her in. That means we need to go from a string (‘Ada’) to a bucket number. The process of doing this is our <strong>hashing function</strong>.</p>

<p>We’ll invent a simple hashing function for this example. Let’s take each letter in the user’s name and assign it a number; <code>A=0</code>, <code>B=1</code>, <code>C=2</code> etc.
At the end, we can add all of the values together. The result is our <strong>hash</strong>.</p>

<p>For ‘Ada’, that’s 3 - so we can store Ada in bucket 3:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/3.png" alt="Ada in bucket 3"></p>

<p>When we need to retrieve ‘Ada’ later, we can perform the same hashing function on her name. That will tell us to look for her in bucket number 3, no looping through arrays required.</p>

<p>Let’s store our next user, ‘Grace’:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/4.png" alt="Grace"></p>

<p>The hash for ‘grace’ is 29, but we don’t have 29 buckets!</p>

<p>Storing items using just their hashed value would mean we would need a very large number of buckets. Instead, we need a way to convert the hashed value (29) to a bucket number (from 0 to 3).</p>

<p>A common way to do this is to <strong>divide the hash by the number of buckets, and use the remainder as the bucket number</strong>.</p>

<p>The remainder after dividing two numbers is called the <a href="https://blog.mattclemente.com/2019/07/12/modulus-operator-modulo-operation.html">modulus</a>.  The hash of ‘grace’ is 29 and we have 4 buckets. The remainder after dividing 29 by 4 is 1, so ‘grace’ is stored in bucket number 1.</p>

<p>This operation can be written ad <code>29 % 4 = 1</code>, or <code>29 mod 4 = 1</code>.</p>

<p>This is what our hash table looks like when we calculate the buckets this way:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/5.png" alt="Grace and Ada in buckets"></p>

<h2 id="collisions">Collisions</h2>

<p>A good hashing function aims to distribute items evenly throughout the buckets.</p>

<p>In practice though, we’re eventually going to end up computing the same bucket for more than one item. This is called a <strong>collision</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s store ‘Tim’:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/6.png" alt="Tim"></p>

<p>We now have two users that need to be stored in bucket 3:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/7.png" alt="Collision"></p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to deal with this:</p>

<p>We could use an algorithm to keep picking new buckets until we find one that is empty, and then store our item there. The approach of only ever having one item in each bucket is called <strong>Open Addressing</strong>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of storing just <em>one</em> item in each bucket, we could store a <em>collection</em> of items. When we find a collision using this method, we simply put both items in the same bucket.</p>

<p>When we need to retrieve the item later, we can still jump straight to the correct bucket. This time, though, the bucket could contain more than one item. In that case, we’ll check each item in the bucket in turn, looking for the one we want.</p>

<p>This is called <strong>Separate Chaining</strong>, and is commonly chosen for hash table implementations.</p>

<p>This is one reason why <strong>good hashing functions are incredibly important for performance</strong>.</p>

<p>A bad hash function won’t distribute items evenly, so they end up concentrated in only a small number of the available buckets.</p>

<p>In the worst case, where everything ends up in the <em>same</em> bucket, we’re potentially looping through <em>every item</em> to find what we’re looking for. That’s what we are trying to avoid by using a hash table in the first place!</p>

		<p>When people think about the WebGL API, they focus on one of the famous libraries
that use it. Typically <a href="https://threejs.org/">"three.js"</a> or
<a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">"Babylon"</a>. There's barely any motivation
to use the WebGL API directly. But the WebGL API is still just as important to
know as it provides creative ways to place colors in browser pages.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#1">WebGL spec</a> even starts by saying:</p>
<p><em>Given the many use cases of 3D graphics, WebGL chooses the approach of providing
flexible primitives that can be applied to any use case. Libraries can provide
an API on top of WebGL that is more tailored to specific areas, thus adding a
convenience layer to WebGL that can accelerate and simplify development. However,
because of its OpenGL ES 2.0 heritage, it should be straightforward for
developers familiar with modern desktop OpenGL or OpenGL ES 2.0 development to
transition to WebGL development.</em></p>
<p>WebGL was made closer to OpenGL ES 2.0 (a C/C++-oriented framework) than closer
to its sibling web APIs.</p>
<p>For a front-end developer, programing directly in WebGL feels like juggling
many unseen global variables while struggling to understand why functions take
those strange byte arguments.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/maskontop.png" alt="Three colored COVID face masks on top of each other"></p>
<h2 id="graphics-frameworks-that-work-on-top-of-graphics-frameworks">Graphics frameworks that work on top of graphics frameworks</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a lot of frameworks that simplify our life when dealing
with the WebGL API. The most recent web-trend of these use threejs and tries to
bring back some helpful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML</a>-like concepts through tags/components. For React,
there is <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber">"react-three-fiber"</a>.
For Web Components, the <a href="https://aframe.io/">"a-frame"</a>, and recently
<a href="https://troisjs.github.io/">"troisjs"</a> for Vue, among many others.</p>
<p>These frameworks provide the same sort of standard graphical decomposition.
They use <em>"cameras"</em> pointed into a <em>"scene"</em> of <em>"objects"</em> with <em>"materials"</em>
and <em>"transformations"</em> applied to them.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-webgl-directly">Why use WebGL directly?</h2>
<p>Using the WebGL API directly, at the very least, helps you understand how it
works and consequently how those trendy high-level graphics frameworks get to
deploy their concepts. It is not for the faint of heart. WebGL is a low-level
API that inherits a lot of stuff from OpenGL ES, inheriting a lot from OpenGL,
inheriting a lot from the 90s. Oh, the 90s, the dark ages of API design.</p>
<p>All that taken into consideration, there are some <strong>real</strong> benefits for the
enthusiastic programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn an abstraction of GPU graphics and primitives:</strong> in WebGL, there are
no <em>"cameras"</em> or even a <em>"scene"</em> with <em>"materials"</em>. Instead, you get to use
<em>"buffers"</em> and <em>"programs"</em>, and <em>"vertex array objects"</em> in <em>"shader"</em> code
written with a specific syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on shaders:</strong> WebGL is all about the code that runs ultra fast in the
GPU, using specific techniques to leverage high-performance parallel runs.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate mode API:</strong> Learning how to use an immediate mode graphics API is
cool to understand how it is biased towards baking things in initialization
to reduce the draw calls that get executed at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are willing to go down that rabbit hole, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_Started">start here</a>
and proceed with the excellent <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/">WebGL 2 Fundamentals</a>.</p>
<h2 id="abstract-the-frustration-away">Abstract the frustration away</h2>
<p>With WebGL, even simple things take quite a bit of code. A simple image is
never "simple". It can require pages of code in setup and initialization and a
whole WebGL global state system that needs to be maintained.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/masksontree.png" alt="A tree with COVID masks as leafs"></p>
<p>As a result, 10 years ago, back in the early days of WebGL (which today has
its 10th anniversary!), a few libraries showed up that used a thin abstraction
layer on top of it and tried to deal with the boilerplate JS code.
<a href="https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js/">lightgl.js</a> is one of these notorious
libs.</p>
<p>Writing and maintaining the WebGL boilerplate can be quite a traumatic
experience for the aspiring front-end developer. There are many formulations
of its concepts that have evolved through these 10 years.</p>
<h2 id="being-declarative-without-losing-the-webgl-domain">Being declarative without losing the WebGL domain</h2>
<p>The new graphics frameworks bring into the declarative space the primitives
that threejs handle in code. They do it subtly by bridging DOM libraries
(React, Vue, or even bare Web Components) and standard high-level graphics
primitives.</p>
<p>HTML tags are excellent in providing sequence and hierarchy in a declarative
way. Their structure is an easy match for scene graphs.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML</a> was onto something, and now we know
it.</p>
<p>What if this declarative tag-oriented approach could be used in the WebGL
domain primitives instead of the typical camera/scene graph representation?</p>
<h2 id="meet-shader-canvas">Meet <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas"><code>&lt;shader-canvas&gt;</code></a></h2>
<p>In my life quest of making different drawing tools and apps, I find myself
leaning more towards using buffers and GLSL programs than with "cameras" and
nodes.</p>
<p>I am not a graphics programmer by trade and tend to start thinking about
shader code and how data will flow with it before any other graphical
abstraction. This was a strong motivation to create a low-level WebGL
abstraction that could be easily visible and declared with tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/rainbowcube.png" alt="A cube defined by its edges, each edge is a rainbow"></p>
<p>The idea is simple and two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an HTML tag for each WebGL function.</li>
<li>Have HTML tags to contain the instances of WebGL primitives.</li>
</ol>
<p>After experimenting for a while with Web Components, I have come up with the
library's initial version.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">The shader-canvas project site.</a></p>
<p>It purposely has no graphics or fluffy examples to watch at this stage. It is
a proof-of-concept and the base of my future work.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Before I started doing <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">shader-canvas</a>, I repeatedly wrote the same WebGL code
with small nuances. I looked for inspiration in other libraries in how to
decompose graphical problems. The part that intrigued me most was the balance
between the WebGL API's low-level aspects and its high-level compositions. It
should be possible to target a lower-mid-level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Today is the 10th anniversary of WebGL. It felt appropriate to write about it
and introduce <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">shader-canvas</a> together with some of
the motivation behind it.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">Shader-canvas</a> is a graphics framework that uses HTML
tags to perform the WebGL
API calls and manage its primitives. It does not have a camera or a scene.
Instead, there is a set of tags to declare most of the recurrent WebGL code
that I found myself writing over and over.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So I've been using my new M1-based MacBook Pro for a couple of months for a mix of development, email, and other things an <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly">open-source maintainer</a> does day-to-day.</p>
<p>The typical first reaction that you get when using this is "it runs my Docker stack without sounding like a plane taking off??".</p>
<p>It's a pretty amazing piece of engineering, and in many ways, I think that the ARM architecture is the future. A number of fast-growing tech giants (besides Apple) are pouring a ton of money into making ARM work for a ton of use-cases: Nvidia (trying to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html">buy ARM Holdings from SoftBank</a>) and Amazon (deep investment in the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">Graviton processors</a>) are the two that primarily come to mind.</p>
<p>As you might know, in processors low energy consumption (and low heat dissipation) often equates to the ability to scale processing efficiently for large workloads. It also means longer battery cycles for non-cloud use-cases (less waste, more bang for the buck). This is why I think ARM is the future, even if it might take a decade for the mainstream cloud to migrate over.</p>
<p>My Xeon Linux-based workstation suddenly feels old.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>All the software I need to use "just works". I found that if an ARM-native version is not available for an application, the emulated one works just fine and there's no performance drawback that I can notice. To emulate an application, you just need to install Rosetta 2. The OS will automatically detect that Rosetta is needed and prompt you to install it. However, you can also install it manually via</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
</code></pre>
<p>The tools you use for development are likely still catching up to this architectural change, and will be for some time. We engineers sometimes use very low-level system capabilities. In some cases, I had to install preview editions of software, but everything worked very well for me. Here are some programs that I've tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Chrome (native)</li>
<li>✅ 1Password (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Zoom (native)</li>
<li>✅ Backblaze (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Signal (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Spotify (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ VS Code. The amd64 version works perfectly well, however, the terminal will be an amd64 process, which may cause some programs to also run as amd64. The arm64 native version is available on the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VS Code Insiders</a> and works really well.</li>
<li>✅ Docker. M1 native version is a must. Emulation doesn't have virtualization features, which the Docker app requires. You can download the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker App for M1</a>, which is in preview. As mentioned on the documentation page, there are some limitations currently related to HTTP proxy, VPN clients, and performance, but the Docker team is making progress fast. (A month or two ago Kubernetes wasn't working, but now it is!).</li>
<li>✅ Brew (native, encountered some issues with git, but was able to fix them)</li>
<li>✅ iTerm 2 (native)</li>
<li>✅ OBS (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Earthly (<code>v0.5.1+</code> now supports M1 natively - just <code>brew install earthly</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also mention that during the first few weeks I had some issues with audio skips when using Bluetooth, but an OS update fixed it (just like <a href="https://www.imore.com/fix-way-m1-mac-bluetooth-problems">Apple promissed</a>).</p>
<p>I also use a ✅ YubiKey 5C Nano and a bunch of random peripherals like a ✅ USB microphone and a ✅ dock plugged into Ethernet.</p>
<p>Languages and frameworks I've tested - most of them in Docker containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Go. <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin">1.16 RC adds support for building darwin/arm64 binaries</a>. I built binaries in Docker and ran them natively. Works great.</li>
<li>🟡 Java and Scala. I had issues with the JVM, experiencing random process hangs. It seems that there are no official OpenJDK builds for aarch64, however there are some community options. See more info below.</li>
<li>✅ C++ works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>🔴 .Net didn't work for me natively nor emulated. I did not investigate why though.</li>
<li>✅ Elixir works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ gRPC works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ JavaScript / Node works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Python works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Ruby and Ruby on Rails works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Cobol (yes, really) works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Rust works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtotellwhatarchitectureaprogramisrunningas">How to tell what architecture a program is running as</h2>
<p>It's extremely easy to mistake the kind of architecture you run as. Rosetta 2 is that good.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell the difference is by opening Activity Monitor and looking at the Architecture column: if it says <code>Apple</code>, it's ARM. If it says <code>Intel</code>, it's X86_64. Here's how I can tell that Zoom is an ARM process, while Spotify is an X86_64 process.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img1.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Zoom as an Apple process">
<img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img2.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Spotify as an Intel process"></p><p>If you're not sure about the terminal you're using, you can type <code>uname -m</code>. It'll say either <code>X86_64</code>, <code>arm64</code> (mac) or <code>aarch64</code> (linux). <code>arm64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> are both ARM - <code>uname</code> on Mac just reports it differently compared to Linux.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img3.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' as 'arm64'"></p><h2 id="brewissues">Brew issues</h2>
<p>One issue I encountered on both my M1 laptop and also a <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">MacStadium MacMini</a> instance that we use for Mac testing is that Brew randomly started to complain about git missing. Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.</p>
<p>(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)</p>
<p>Back to fixing the issue now. Using <code>brew doctor</code> I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: <code>xcode-select --install</code>. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew <code>git</code> via <code>brew uninstall git</code> and simply rely on <code>git</code> from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu">@vladaionescu</a>)</p>
<h2 id="usingdocker">Using Docker</h2>
<p>The Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>The Docker for Mac app comes packed with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are <code>curl</code>ing some binary that may need to switch from <code>X86_64</code> to <code>aarch64</code> in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg <code>shellcheck</code>).</p>
<p>The Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/thajeztah">Sebastiaan van Stijn</a>, member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499"><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png" alt="We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a &quot;best effort&quot;, and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture."></a></p>
<p>Almost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka">Kafka community image</a> is amd64 only. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis">Redis image</a> is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore">Docker Hub page for a tag (eg <code>latest</code>)</a> and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown"></p><p>To build an image for a different architecture, you can use <code>docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .</code> instead of the usual <code>docker build .</code>. For more details on building multi-platform images see <a href="https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2">Akihiro Suda's blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker pull</code> an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker run</code> an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img4.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms"></p><p>Docker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> for the service definition in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> if you'd like to be specific.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (<a href="https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7">abandoned PR here</a>). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. <strong>However</strong>, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.</p>
<p>Another issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443">@jasmas claims</a>. I've also seen some <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638">benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL</a>, and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.</p>
<h2 id="usingvscode">Using VS Code</h2>
<p>Native support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx">VS Code Insiders</a>.</p>
<p>An issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just that good). In some situations, this led to some strange issues when running Docker, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>We finished our second data bounty Monday, March 1. The target of the bounty was <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency">hospital prices</a>. The results surpassed our expectations. </p>
<p>We built a database of 1,400 of approximately 6,000 US hospital's chargemasters, representing over 72.7M prices, all in the same SQL schema. The bounty cost $10,000 and ran for six weeks. Bounties are the cheapest, fastest way to wrangle a dataset into existence. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-style versioning. It's the first SQL database you can branch and merge. <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> is a place on the internet to share and collaborate on Dolt databases. Without both, data bounties would not be possible. Bounty participants submit their proposed changes back to the repository with Pull Requests, just like code changes on GitHub. This makes it possible for over a dozen people to sanely collaborate on the same dataset at once. Dolt and DoltHub radically reduce the cost of collaborating on databases.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency">resulting database</a> is 19.4GB. That's a lot of prices. To get a copy of the database, <a href="https://docs.dolthub.com/getting-started/installation">install Dolt</a> and run <code>dolt clone dolthub/hospital-price-transparency</code>. You'll have a full copy of the database and its history. </p>
<p> <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency/query/master?q=SELECT+count%28*%29%0AFROM+%60hospitals%60%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=Tables">1400 hospitals</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency/query/master?q=SELECT+count%28*%29%0AFROM+%60cpt_hcpcs%60%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=Tables">3,287,818 CPT or HCPCS codes</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency/query/master?q=SELECT+count%28*%29%0AFROM+%60prices%60%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=Tables">72,724,852 prices</a> are represented in the database. 79 Pull Requests (PRs) from 14 bounty participants were accepted. Since there are just over 6,000 US hospitals, this means we gathered price data for about 23% of them in six weeks, at a cost of about $7 each. The top participant earned $5,318 by contributing 158,223,996 cells.</p>

<p>We can confidently say that this is the best open US Hospital Price database available. We can't wait to see what people do with it.</p>
<h2>How can this database be used?</h2>
<p>Since we just finished this bounty Monday, we haven't had much time to do analysis of the data. We'll have some follow up blog posts with analysis over the next few weeks. This database can be used to answer questions like: </p>
<ul>
<li>What hospitals are complying with the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">federal chargemaster regulation</a>?</li>
<li>What is the cheapest/most expensive hospital? </li>
<li>Which insurer gets the best deals?</li>
<li>How do prices vary across procedure within a hospital? ie. Are hospitals uniformly expensive for all procedures or expensive for some procedures and not others?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/bounties">DoltHub Bounties</a> are the fastest, cheapest way to build databases from open data. </p>
<p>Our plan is to run at least one bounty per month for the rest of the year across a number of distinct data disciplines. We're running a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-02-22-course-catalog-bounty/">US Course Catalog Bounty</a> right now. We'll be launching one more over the next week or so. Hang out in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord</a> to keep up to date. Start wrangling data as your new side hustle.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-6c2d97ef28007e66bdeb"><div><p>A metaskill is a master skill—a skill that magnifies and activates other skills. In a period of great change, such as the one we’re living in now, our most important metaskill may be imagination. Imagination lets us invent new business models, create differentiated brands, and reframe a growing number of problems as opportunities. Yet it’s also our most mysterious skill. How is it possible to conjure up images, feelings and concepts that we can’t perceive through our senses?</p><p>It turns out that when people talk about “dreaming up” an idea, they’re not far from the truth—imagination has been closely linked to dream states. Neuroscientists Charles Limb and Allen Braun studied the brains of jazz musicians, revealing a “disassociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex” when they played improvisational music. This pattern was absent when the musicians played memorized sequences. These disassociated patterns, they say, are similar to what happens during REM sleep. Dreaming is marked by a sense of unfocused attention, unplanned or irrational associations, and an apparent loss of control.</p><p>Dreams don’t simply visit us. While we’re asleep, we actively create them the same way we create our perceptions while we’re awake. What makes dreams so fascinating is the absence of logical narrative. Even though the scenes we create in our dreams may seem random, their emotional trajectory often makes complete sense; our emotions are fully engaged, while our reasoning is disconnected.</p><p>Dreaming can be harnessed for any purpose using what I call applied imagination. Once we learn the “trick” of dreaming—of disassociating our thoughts from the linear and the logical—we can become wellsprings of originality.</p><p><strong>The tar pits of knowledge</strong></p><p>It’s axiomatic that, to innovate, you need to move from the <em>known</em> to the <em>unknown</em>. You need to hold your beliefs lightly so that what you believe doesn’t block your view of what you might find out. &nbsp;</p><p>This is difficult for most people. When asked to imagine a new tool for slicing bread or a new melody for a song, they may stare blankly, as if to say, “How could there be such a thing?” They may recall many of the knives or popular songs they’ve known, but nothing new will come to mind. At most, they might try to combine the features of two or more existing examples to come up with a hybrid.</p><p>The number-one hazard for innovators is getting stuck in the “tar pits of knowledge.” While knowledge can free us to imagine new-to-the-world ideas, it can also trap us into believing opportunities are smaller than they are. When we’re stumped by a problem, or when we feel hurried to solve it, our brains can easily default to off-the-shelf solutions based on “what everyone knows.” You might say the problem-solving mind is a sucker for a pretty fact. What we know today may not be what we need to know tomorrow. So to avoid jumping to conclusions, we need to hold off on solving a problem until we can perceive the general shape of its solution.</p><p>There are three steps for generating a creative solution to a problem:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>discover <em>what is</em>;</p></li><li><p>imagine <em>what could be</em>;</p></li><li><p>and describe the <em>attributes of success</em>.</p></li></ol><p>Let’s examine each in turn.</p><p><strong>What is? </strong>This is the body of known facts about the problem: Why is it a problem? What is its history? What is the conventional thinking about it? How have similar problems been solved in the past, perhaps in other domains? And what are the practical constraints of the problem?</p><p><strong>Constraints </strong>are the limitations imposed by the context of a problem, which might include budgets, time, manpower, habits, conventions, or fears. They squeeze the problem down to a size you can focus on. Without constraints, solutions tend towards the ungainly, the unfocused, and the unimaginative. Unbounded challenges are anathema to innovators; bounded challenges provide not only a starting place, but a booster shot of adrenaline.</p><p>In a famous 1854 lecture at the University of Lille, Louis Pasteur said: “<em>Dans les champs de l’observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprit préparés.</em>” In the field of observation, chance favours only the prepared mind. Pasteur’s statement is often used to support the idea that hard work trumps talent, but it also suggests that the better you understand the facts and constraints, the better your chances of solving the problem.</p><p><strong>What could be?</strong> Facts and constraints are necessary but insufficient. To envision what’s possible, you also need imagination. One way to get started is by asking deeper questions. For example, when Thomas Edison imagined the light bulb, he didn’t frame the question as, How can we create an alternative source of light? Instead, he framed it as, How can we make electricity so cheap that “only the rich will burn candles”? While you can easily overreach the possibilities by thinking too big, it’s much easier to tame a wild idea than to reanimate a dead one.</p><p><strong>The attributes of success. </strong>The shape of a missing answer is formed at the intersection of affordances and desiderata.</p><p><strong>Affordances</strong> are the counterpoint to constraints: they are creative possibilities that are native to the subject, the method, the tools, or the challenge. For example, a movie about the early days of movies contains the affordance of being a silent film (<em>The Artist</em>); a car designed for the poor population of India contains the affordance of being extremely minimal (Tata Motors); and a company with a breadth of experience but a commoditized product line has the possibility to become a consulting firm (IBM).</p><p><strong>Desiderata</strong> are secondary objectives that support a goal or a solution, and this principle can be applied to any number of problems. It’s really as simple as compiling a wish list. Ask yourself this question and fill in the blank: Wouldn’t it be great if ______? When you finish your list, call out the wishes that would create the most compelling outcome. These will form a sort of matrix that defines the shape of your answer.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_16_1478736556189_73766"><div><p>To make your wish list more than an ordinary shopping list, you’ll need to engage your imagination. Imagination is the key to originality, and originality is the key to building sustainable businesses and brands. By definition, originality is the only thing that can’t be copied. Let’s take a look at how to get started.</p><p><strong>Reviving the play instinct</strong></p><p>Imagination is the child of obstinacy and playfulness: it comes from a refusal to settle for the comfortable answer while having fun doing it. During the Industrial Age, fun was discouraged. It took time to have fun, and time was the non-renewable resource that needed to be maximized and measured. Employees were paid by the number of pieces they could complete or the predetermined function they performed, not by the number of new ideas they brought to the table. Time was money, and money was time.</p><p>After the clock came to Europe in 1307, it took less than a century for mechanical time to sweep the continent. With clocks, you could agree on the delivery of a shipment, regularize the baking of bread, and estimate the completion of a brick wall. Clocks paved the way for sophisticated banking, transportation, mass production, and eventually computers. They brought precision to business; but they also brought an undue emphasis on quantity over quality.</p><p>The ancient Greeks understood that time comes in two flavours: objective time, called chronos; and subjective time, called kairos. <em>Chronos</em><strong> </strong>could be measured by the sun, the moon or the seasons. <em>Kairos</em><strong> </strong>could not be measured, only judged by the quality of one’s experience. My kairos is different from your kairos, but our chronos is the same. Today we use the term quality time to describe the experience of living in unmeasured time. We find that as soon as we measure or limit quality time, it quickly turns into quantity time.</p><p>Think back to a day in your childhood when you were so busy playing that you lost track of the clock. The minutes and hours blended seamlessly, one into the next, while your mind focused on some engaging activity. As you grew older, this play instinct began to fade. The requirements of society demanded more attention to objective time—an adherence to deadlines, agreements and social courtesies—until play became more and more associated with non-productivity, a kind of time that had no commercial value.</p><p>Yet quality time is the state in which imagination flourishes best. You can’t decide to produce an insight in 30 minutes, or to have an idea by 3:15. But you can decide to forget about the clock and focus on the challenge at hand, in which case you may well have an idea by 3:15—or even five ideas. Imagination takes as long as it takes, and rushing it usually slows it down. This is the central conflict between the world of business and the world of creativity. They need each other, but can’t seem to understand each other. They’re working in two different kinds of time.</p><p>The solution to this dilemma, in my experience, is for business ‘doers’ and creative ‘dreamers’ to focus on goals instead of deadlines. Goals form the common ground that unites both workstyles. Focus on goals, take away the clocks, and start playing as soon as possible. What you’ll find is that generating ideas ‘out of time’ can produce results much faster than holding yourself to a deadline. If you wait until the last minute, however, leaving little opportunity for play, you’ll find yourself clutching the first idea that floats by. Quantity time will enter the picture and force a mediocre result.</p><p>If you could pry the roof off of all the mediocre companies in the world, you’d see an army of adrenaline addicts working on perpetual deadline, madly checking boxes instead of thinking ahead. You can get an immediate buzz from getting things done, but innovation requires something more: unmeasured time spent in the ‘dragon pit’, the space between what is and what could be.&nbsp; But what should you be doing there? What are the rules of creative play? How do you know when you’re winning?</p><p>Here’s where quantity plays a crucial role. The best creative thinkers are …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Did your last Yubikey just break? Perhaps you forgot an offline backup password. Maybe you're just tired of <a href="https://gist.github.com/grugq/03167bed45e774551155">living like a spy</a> and never using smartphones. Whatever it is, you're here, and you're finally ready to <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp">give up on PGP</a>. That's great!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gtank.cc/content/images/2019/02/225357.jpg"><figcaption>We're here to help!</figcaption></figure><p>No one was sending you encrypted emails anyway, so that's easy enough. But the most widespread uses of PGP are machine-oriented, for needs like package signing and local file encryption. I recently got into this again on a thread that mentioned <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30141">deprecating Go's OpenPGP package</a> and people always ask the same question: if not PGP, then what?</p><p>The thing is, there can't be a direct modern alternative to PGP. It's a do-everything design that predates modern cryptographic engineering and hasn't worked out well. The "modern alternative" is to use a much more specific and much less configurable solution to your problem.</p><p>Here are the most common uses of PGP and their modern, focused alternatives.</p><h2 id="signatures-for-os-or-package-updates">Signatures for OS or package updates</h2><p><strong>Original need:</strong> <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu#0">Linux distributions</a> and many other software update mechanisms use PGP signatures to prevent malicious mirrors or network attackers from altering the contents of their packages.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative:</strong> a lightweight signing tool like OpenBSD's <a href="https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify">signify</a> or <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>, either of which you could quickly build in Go using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519">x/crypto/ed25519</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>After a recent debugging session, discovering I had once again been the victim of a dishonest function signature, I was... Well, let’s just say I was unimpressed. Two thoughts popped up in my head – the first one was «ahh.. this thing again..», and the second was «wait, why is this still even a thing?». It left me in a state of frustration.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>The language was JavaScript, and the function was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"><code>Array.prototype.sort</code></a>. Now, before we go on, let me just say that this is far from yet another JavaScript rant. Enough of those exists on the internet already. In fact, I don’t have a lot of problems with the language itself – this exact issue probably exists in most languages. I would like to say <em>all</em>, but I’m sure I would be proven wrong by someone on the internet.</p>
<p>But enough of that. As said, my problem was with <code>Array.prototype.sort</code>. It’s a sorting function. It sorts arrays. You give it an array and a comparator function, and get a sorted array back. Should be easy enough?</p>
<p>Let’s see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>unsorted </span><span>= [</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>99</span><span>, </span><span>50</span><span>]
</span><span>const </span><span>sorted </span><span>= </span><span>unsorted</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>a </span><span>- </span><span>b</span><span>)
</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>sorted</span><span>)
</span><span>// -&gt; [0, 50, 99]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, if we glance past the comparator function (which I dislike, but that’s the story of another blog post), there’s not too much going on here. The TypeScript definition makes a lot of sense as well:</p>
<pre><code><span>Array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;.</span><span>sort</span><span>(compareFn</span><span>?: </span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>T</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>T</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>number) </span><span>| </span><span>undefined</span><span>): T[]
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>sort</code> is a function on <code>Array</code>s. We can even see that if we don’t supply a comparator function it should work anyway, as the return type says we always receive an array.</p>
<p>Now, let’s alter our example just a bit</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>unsorted </span><span>= [</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>99</span><span>, </span><span>50</span><span>]
</span><span>const </span><span>sorted </span><span>= </span><span>unsorted</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>a </span><span>- </span><span>b</span><span>)
</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>unsorted</span><span>) </span><span>// &lt;-- this is the altered bit – we print the original array instead of the sorted one
// [0, 50, 99]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Wait a minute... What? Our unsorted array is now sorted, even though we never sorted it? Something weird is definitely going on here. Or, weird might be the wrong word – surprising and confusing are better alternatives.</p>
<p>Once you read the documentation over at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">MDN</a> the surprise starts to make sense quickly. <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> actually sorts the array <em>in place</em>. It’s even there in the absolute <em>first sentence</em>. There are at least two conclusions we can draw from this fact</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript definitions cannot tell the whole truth of how functions should be used</li>
<li>It’s the first thing mentioned in the documentation – I am probably not the first one to make this mistake</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, errors like these annoys me. It makes my day a lot harder than what it needs to be. I like making things. I don’t like wasting time when it could have easily been avoided.</p>
<h2 id="dishonest-functions">Dishonest Functions</h2>
<p>It’s easy to put the blame on me as a developer. I should have read the documentation, there’s no denying that. But, what if... what if I didn’t have to read the full documentation to understand this single function?</p>
<p><code>Array.prototype.sort</code> is an example of what I like to call dishonest functions. Functions that for some reason likes to hide who they really are, and surprise you when you least expect it. A function signature acts as a promise (an <em>actual</em> promise, not the programming construct) – a promise from the writer of the function to me as a user that this function will behave in a certain way. When a function breaks that promise, it acts dishonestly. Our example with <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> is a bit sneaky, though. The type system can’t tell me whether our unsorted array is mutated in any way, so you could argue that it doesn’t break any promises. But there is a catch here – by returning an array, there is an implicit expectation that it leaves the input alone. No matter how hard I try, I can’t see any valid case where mixing these two behaviors makes sense.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> is that there is no single best way of using it. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">examples at MDN</a> seems to favor ignoring the return value. This works, but ignoring return values from functions is a code smell. Return values are there for a reason – ignoring them is just as bad as catching and swallowing exceptions. There are even linting rules to stop us from making such mistakes. But as we have seen, <em>not</em> ignoring the return value gives us another problem. In our first example, our array named <code>unsorted</code> is in fact <em>sorted</em>, so our code communicates the wrong thing. This is a sleeping bug just waiting to make your day really bad.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a different example – this time from Kotlin</p>
<pre><code><span>fun</span><span> String.</span><span>toInt</span><span>()</span><span>: </span><span>Int
</span></code></pre>
<p>A straight forward function signature. You have a String, you call <code>toInt</code>, you receive an <code>Int</code>. You might already have guessed where this is going – let’s see what happens if we do something completely unreasonable, such as calling it with something that is not a number.</p>
<pre><code><span>val </span><span>myString </span><span>= "</span><span>not-a-number</span><span>"
</span><span>val </span><span>myNumber </span><span>=</span><span> myString</span><span>.</span><span>toInt()
</span><span>// --&gt; java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "not-a-number"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Oops! That’s not cool at all. You don’t want this in your production code. You might be thinking «yeah, as if I would ever do such a mistake...» right now, and I’m not here to argue with that. But what about your teammate who started programming professionally two months ago? Would they be able to catch these errors just as easy? I know <em>I</em> have done this mistake myself – several times.</p>
<p>The important part here is not the examples themselves, but rather that it’s impossible to know about these inconsistencies unless you have encountered them before, or happen to read the full documentation about every function that you use.</p>
<h2 id="honest-functions">Honest Functions</h2>
<p>Unlike dishonest functions, an honest function is, in lack of better words: honest. It tells you exactly how it behaves through its function signature, and possibly other, established norms. These norms might differ from language to language, but they should be consistent. In our world of honest functions, neither <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> or <code>String.toInt()</code> would exist in their current forms. They both hide their actual self, posing as something they’re not.</p>
<p>There are two important properties an honest function should honor: it has to be <em>pure</em>, and it has to be <em>total</em>. In essence, this means three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given the same input (or same arguments, if you will), it should always produce the same output (or return value)</li>
<li>There should be no side effects.</li>
<li>The function has to be defined for all possible values of its input type(s)</li>
</ol>
<p>If a function follows these three properties, there’s a good chance it is honest. Well, unless you intentionally name your function something completely unrelated to the implementation, but let’s try to keep our intentions good here. There is one problem, though. IO is a side effect, and not allowing IO is taking things a bit too far. Some languages have explicit constructs to indicate on a type level if a function needs to perform IO, but you don’t <em>need</em> this to have honest functions. If a function has to print or log something in addition to its main purpose, just name it accordingly! This won’t tick the "no side effects" checkbox, but I will argue that it makes your function honest.</p>
<h2 id="functions-are-like-friends">Functions are like friends</h2>
<p>Let me end this blog post with something that’s really cheesy, but that also somewhat works. I will compare functions to friendship. Yeah. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Just like we all favor honest friends, we should also favor honest functions. We can most likely tolerate the odd lie here and there as long as it’s small and doesn’t affect us too much, but once the lies grows too big, it starts to have real consequences. Programming is really not too different. If anything, it might be even less forgiving. We can tolerate small amounts of inconsistencies, but too much and it hurts both your ablity to deliver, and ability to reason about your code.</p>
<p>There is no reason we should tolerate dishonest functions when a clear and honest alternative version could be just as easily be implemented. And just to be clear: it <em>always</em> can. Don’t lie to your friends – stay honest, peeps!</p>

It was discovered by Sagi Tzadik, of Check Point Research<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a>, who released an in-depth write up of the bug the day the patch was released. The vulnerability received a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest level of severity . On Windows, a DNS server is a Domain Controller, and its Administrators are part of the Domain Admins group. By default, the Domain Admins group is a member of the Administrators group on all computers that have joined a domain, including the domain controllers<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[8]</a>.

When a client makes a DNS query for the“evil” domain to the victim server, the victim server will query the DNS server above it. The DNS server will respond back with an NS record indicating that the malicious DNS server is the authority for that domain, and the record will be cached by the victim. Afterwards, when a client sends the victim a DNS <strong>SIG</strong> query for the domain, the victim server will query the malicious DNS server. The malicious DNS server will send a malformed DNS <strong>SIG</strong> record as a response. </span></p><div id="viewer-69nme"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/anatomy-of-an-exploit-rce-with-cve-2020-1350-sigred" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_adb7b85135e44f38bcca549851f38d68~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_804%2Ch_567%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_adb7b85135e44f38bcca549851f38d68~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-8keh2"><span><em><span>How an attacker can exploit SIGRed</span></em></span></p><p id="viewer-72vq5"><span>The vulnerability is present in the function <strong>dns!SigWireRead </strong>(in the DNS service binary, <strong>dns.exe </strong>), which is used to cache a DNS <strong>SIG</strong> record response from another DNS server. </span></p><div id="viewer-6k85s"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/anatomy-of-an-exploit-rce-with-cve-2020-1350-sigred" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_ffb865d47c0b4f54925b8c2acb34b036~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_790%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_ffb865d47c0b4f54925b8c2acb34b036~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-77caj"><span><em><span>Decompilation of the vulnerable function, dns!SigWireRead</span></em></span></p><p id="viewer-9het0"><span>Refer to line 11 in the decompilation of the vulnerable function <strong>dns!SigWireRead. </strong>The function <strong>RR_AllocateEx</strong> is passed a 16 bit unsigned integer for the size parameter.

If the requested size of a buffer is more than 0xA0 bytes, it will request the memory from the Windows native heap manager (<strong>HeapAlloc</strong>). Otherwise, it will use a memory pool bucket (sizes 0x50, 0x68, 0x88, and 0xa0). The buffers in each of the buckets are stored in a singly linked list. If there are no more available buffers in the selected bucket, a memory chunk will be requested from the native heap, divided into separate buffers, then added to the list of the corresponding bucket. For buffers of sizes 0x50, 0x68, 0x88, and 0xA0 memory chunks of sizes 0xFF0, 0xFD8, 0xFF0, and 0xFA0 are requested, respectively.</span></p><div id="viewer-urta"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/anatomy-of-an-exploit-rce-with-cve-2020-1350-sigred" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_3601d110d2484f8198fa362f9253d1cc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_3601d110d2484f8198fa362f9253d1cc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-7bhic"><span><em>Approximate decompilation of dns!Mem_Alloc</em></span></p><p id="viewer-d2jcj"><span>When buffers in one of the memory buckets are freed, they are not returned to the Windows native heap.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Evolutionary forces drive a glaring gender imbalance in the occurrence of many health conditions, including autism, a team of genetics researchers has concluded.</p>
<p>The human genome has evolved to favour the inheritance of very different characteristics in males and females, which in turn makes men more vulnerable to a host of physical and mental health conditions, say the researchers responsible for a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00239-021-09999-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new paper</a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<i>Journal of Molecular Evolution</i>.</p>
<p>Their analysis shows that while there are certain conditions that occur only in women (cervical cancer and ovarian cancer, for example), or much more frequently in women (such as multiple sclerosis), men are more prone to medical conditions overall and, as a result, on average die sooner than women.</p>
<p>“Our cells have memories and they carry the accumulation of all the changes our ancestors have experienced over millions of years,” says Rama Singh, a McMaster biology professor who wrote the paper with his son, Karun Singh, an associate professor of neuropathology at the University of Toronto,&nbsp;and Shiva Singh (no relation), a biology professor at Western University.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at autism as an illustration of the general tendency for men to develop medical conditions more often than women. Though women and men inherit the same genetic blueprints from their parents, the way those blueprints are expressed is very different, depending on sex.</p>
<p>“If women and men were any more different, they would be different species,” jokes Rama Singh, the paper’s corresponding author.</p>
<p>The researchers’ work is part of a growing movement toward exploring genomic influences on health, using hereditary patterns to understand and project health impacts on individuals and populations.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons I think this is interesting is that it offers a perspective that is not well represented in the medical literature,” says Karun Singh. “This is a really good example of the perspective that geneticists and evolutionary biologists can add to health research.”</p>
<p>The paper explores hereditary forces that have evolved over millions of years, favoring mate selection and reproduction in the early years of male sexual maturity at the expense of longer-term well-being.</p>
<p>Though human behaviour regarding mate selection has changed, those genetic characteristics remain and continue to be expressed in the health and development of modern men.</p>
<p>Women, the researchers say, typically live longer and are less vulnerable to most health conditions because their genetic makeup has evolved in reaction to the unhealthy characteristics of the male genome, creating better immunity and greater longevity.</p>
<p>Understanding human health through the lens of genomics can and should guide the search for treatments and preventions, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Though the origins of mental health conditions are more complex, they are influenced by the same evolutionary factors, the authors say. Women are more prone to depression and anxiety, for example, while men are more likely to develop anti-social disorders.</p>
<p>In autism, male-female imbalance is especially pronounced.&nbsp;Boys are as much as four times more likely to have some form of autism and are also more likely to have severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Evolution appears to have created a higher threshold that protects more women from developing the condition, the authors say.</p>
<p>While autism is not solely attributable to inherited characteristics, it appears that boys are more likely to inherit characteristics that render them more vulnerable to environmental, developmental and other factors, creating more pathways that can lead to autism.</p>

The swedish car manufacturer plans to produce only pure electric vehicle before 2030, also aims at making online sales through the site.

The Swedish car manufacturer Volvo announced a few days ago that it will completely terminate the sales of gasoline and diesel engine cars in 2030. 
</p><p>
At the same time, in order to establish direct contact with customers, it plans to change the sales of electric vehicles from physical dealers to direct sales on the website.
</p><p>
Volvo said in 2018 that it plans to change half of its car models to all-electric in 2025. The latest plan is more aggressive than before.
</p><p>
In October last year, Volvo launched the first pure electric vehicle XC40 Recharge, and yesterday announced the latest C40 Recharge. 
</p><p>
Volvo has accelerated the pace of transformation because the group firmly believes that the fuel engine vehicle market is shrinking, and the internal combustion engine has no long-term future, so it decided to transform.
</p><p>
And now, the company has started working to become a pure electric vehicle manufacturer and complete the transformation ahead of schedule by 2030.

Volvo's method of selling cars will also be changed. Customers can order cars through the website in addition to the showroom or at home, and the price is controlled by Volvo centrally.
</p><p>
Current dealers also need to transform to provide Volvo with new car delivery, maintenance and repair services. They also need to provide test cars for customers who plan to buy cars, and cooperate to promote online sales.
</p>

<p>Error reporting is vital to web app development, and sentry is a popular solution for this. As such, it's now easier than ever to integrate it into your IHP app. Check out the plugin's readme for details on how to get it running inside your IHP app: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-sentry">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-sentry</a>.</p>

<h3>ihp-zip</h3>
<p>Sometimes your users want to download a lot of files at once. Especially with the DSGVO, users could always request all their data from your website. What better way to handle this than implementing a simple zip-download containing everything they ask for? Previously this might've been a hassle, but now with the new ihp-zip plugin, it's a breeze. Just like before, check out the plugin's readme for installation and usage instructions: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-zip">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-zip</a>.</p>

<h2>WebSockets</h2>
<p>IHP has always used websockets to update the frontend, and now you can easily use a custom websocket connection too! Just think of the possibilities: chat applications, real-time updates, games...</p>

<p>Of course, to get started you'll have to learn how to tap into this newfound power. Don't worry, we've got you covered: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/websockets.html">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/websockets.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Better Performance</h2>
<p>Everyone loves themselves a faster server. It's best when you don't even have to do anything to get the benefits. So, IHP v0.9 uses GHC's new non-moving memory, which should improve performance of all those awesome IHP apps out there! (Not that there was a performance issue before... But faster is always better, isn't it?)</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>We've already talked about error reporting. However, logging is just as important. And IHP now has its own Logging module ready for you to use! Say goodbye to <code>putStrLn</code>, and say welcome our new overlords <code>Log.debug</code>, <code>Log.info</code>, <code>Log.error</code>, <code>Log.warn</code>, <code>Log.fatal</code> and <code>Log.unknown</code>! You can even customize what a single line of logging looks like. Check out the detailed documentation: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/logging.html">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/logging.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Query Builder Functions</h2>
<p>There's a whole bunch of these:</p>

<h3><code>withTransaction</code></h3>
<p>...allows you to run multiple queries in a single database transaction.</p>

<h3><code>setJust</code></h3>
<p>...so you can simply do <code>project |&gt; setJust #userId (get #id user)</code> instead of <code>project |&gt; set #userId (Just (get #id user))</code>.</p>

<h3><code>distinct</code></h3>
<p>To remove duplicate rows from your query results.</p>

<p>...and more!</p>

<h2>Increased Magic</h2>
<p>Yepp, you heard that right. Actually this is related to AutoRoute. You can finally use more than just UUIDs and Id Project-like arguments for your controllers, without having to manually configure parseArgument. This simply means: less boilerplate, more magic, more productivity! We wrote it, so you don't have to.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This release held a bunch of awesome things, and we're happy that it's finally out there. If you want to read up on all the other awesome things that changed, here's the link to the changelog on Github: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.9.0">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.9.0</a>.</p>

Scientists will be <a href="https://iawn.net/obscamp/Apophis/" target="_blank">watching</a> the 370 meter-wide asteroid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis" target="_blank">99942 Apophis</a> fly by the Earth this Friday, albeit from a safe 0.11 AU away. On Friday the 13th, April 2029, however, Apophis will pass within 31,000 km of the Earth’s surface, inside the orbit of geostationary satellites. Fortunately, while originally estimated at a 1-in-37 chance of a collision in 2029, that possibility has since been ruled out. At the recent “<a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/apophis2020/program/" target="_blank">Apophis T-9 Years</a>” workshop there were proposals for CubeSats, small landers, and larger SLS-launched sample return missions targeting the 2029 flyby. It’s also possible that OSIRIS-REx, after dropping samples off at Earth, could head to Apophis as a mission extension with multiple flybys and finally a rendezvous. On average, an asteroid of Apophis’s size impacts the Earth every 80,000 years, and while Apophis won’t impact the Earth in 2029 or 2036, there is still a <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=99942" target="_blank">small possibility of an impact in 2068</a> (but this too will likely be ruled out by <a href="https://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/Apophis/apophis.2021.goldstone.planning.html" target="_blank">upcoming planetary radar measurements</a>). Until we are confident of a miss, however, we should be very careful because even “<a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4080/1" target="_blank"><em>[a] tiny change in Apophis’ velocity before the April 2029 flyby, caused by the collision of a small satellite with the asteroid, could shift the asteroid’s trajectory by several Earth radii in 2068</em></a>.” Jeff Foust has a <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4080/1" target="_blank">good discussion</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#heavy-delays">¶</a><strong id="heavy-delays">Heavy Delays.</strong> This past week we learned of schedule changes for three in-development heavy lift rockets with very different development histories. NASA, after SLS failed its full-duration hot fire test in January, has now <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/02/prevalve-issue-delays-sls-green-run/" target="_blank">postponed the re-test for at least three more weeks</a> due to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/02/26/green-run-update-nasa-inspecting-valve-continuing-hot-fire-preparations/" target="_blank">LOX pre-valves on the Core Stage</a> that won’t open fully (the LH<sub>2</sub> pre-valves were repaired in the fall). Platforms have to be installed so that technicians can use specially-fabricated tools to access and repair the valves. This continues the litany of delays, overruns, and failures for the incredibly expensive and under-powered giant. In a recent scathing critique, <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/02/24/sls-is-cancellation-too-good/" target="_blank">Casey Handmer calls for SLS’ outright cancellation</a>, claiming that its Shuttle heritage has hurt its safety, development speed, and ultimate usefulness, and that it is only propped up by lobbying, political maneuvering, and NASA’s unwillingness to acknowledge a failure. He quips, <em>“even if SLS wasn’t architecturally unsafe, poorly managed, incredibly expensive, a technological dead end, obsolete, and cursed by a low production rate, it would still have nowhere to go.”</em> SLS’s Block 1 design doesn’t have the power to send humans to the lunar surface (thus the need for the separately-launched <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/more-about-the-human-landing-system-program" target="_blank">Human Landing System</a>) or Mars, or to send large spacecraft to deep space exploration targets. While the allure of returning to the Moon permanently is strong, SLS feels more and more like an unrealistic way to accomplish that goal. Meanwhile, Blue Origin updated New Glenn’s first launch date to NET 2022Q4, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/so-what-really-happened-with-blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket/" target="_blank">roughly what CEO Bob Smith suggested it should be upon taking the helm in 2017</a>. New Glenn has struggled through development, in part due to its massive scale up from New Shepard—building a heavy lift rocket before ever reaching orbit is a monumental undertaking. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenns-progress-towards-maiden-flight" target="_blank">cast shade toward Space Force</a> for not selecting them in their recent contracting process—but blaming them can yield nothing positive for the company. It’s also probably not the real cause of the delay, with the company’s priorities being focused on leading the <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon/national-team" target="_blank">National Team’s bid to build the HLS</a> and delivering flight-qualified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4" target="_blank">BE-4 engines</a> to ULA for this summer’s maiden Vulcan Centaur launch—the staged-combustion methalox engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/ula-chief-says-the-be-4-rocket-engines-turbopump-issues-are-resolved/" target="_blank">suffered late-stage development hiccups with its turbo pump</a>. (Blue Origin recently released videos of their Cape Canaveral <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968313047162880?s=20" target="_blank">rocket factory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968720364429317?s=20" target="_blank">tank cleaning and testing facility</a>, and work at <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364969291746074628?s=20" target="_blank">Launch Complex 36</a>.) In stark comparison, last week Starship SN10 performed a static fire (<a href="https://youtu.be/XE9K3W0ojjk" target="_blank">video</a>), a Raptor engine was swapped out (<a href="https://youtu.be/iuoZjizF_J8?t=127" target="_blank">video</a>), and a second static fire was performed in less than 48 hours (<a href="https://youtu.be/CshqxSkzSYg" target="_blank">video</a>)—the engine was removed <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1364473175279620096?s=21" target="_blank">due to suspect data</a> produced during the initial test. SN10 is now cleared for a flight and triple-engine landing attempt NET today, pushed back from last Friday. While SLS is further along, it’s been under development in some form since the late ‘90s. The difference in development velocity (we’ll call it ∆v) between these three vehicles is striking.

Neutron is targeting 2024 and will require Rocket Lab to pursue different techniques from Electron’s all-composite body and 3D printed engines. The next generation, reusable rocket will be built at an undecided location near NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home" target="_blank">Wallops Flight Facility</a> in Virginia. Electron’s electric pump-fed 3D-printed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_(rocket_engine)" target="_blank">Rutherford engines</a> are only 26 KN, so something larger will be required (for comparison, the original Merlin 1 engine was 340 KN).

Given <a href="https://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEarth/ImpactEffects/#:~:text=The%20minimum%20impact%20velocity%20on,sun%20is%2072%20km%2Fs." target="_blank">comets’ exceptionally high velocities</a> (an average of 51 km/s vs. 17 km/s for asteroids), this new model isn’t something we’re thrilled about. ☄️</li><li>ESA’s <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cheops" target="_blank">Cheops</a> orbital telescope found a planetary system with six exoplanets locked into a pattern of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance" target="_blank">orbital resonance</a>. It’s similar to the 4:2:1 resonance of Io, Ganymede, and Europa, in which Io completes four orbits of Jupiter in the time it takes Ganymede to complete two and Europa, one… but with the six planets forming a 18:9:6:4:3 orbital pattern. “<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cheops/ESA_s_exoplanet_watcher_Cheops_reveals_unique_planetary_system" target="_blank"><em>The orbits in this system are very well ordered, which tells us that this system has evolved quite gently since its birth</em></a>,” making it surprising that their densities are in a seemingly-random order with a “<em>dense, terrestrial planet right next to a similar-sized but very fluffy planet ­­– like a mini-Jupiter, and next to [one that is] very similar to Neptune.</em>”</li><li>Speaking of resonance, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/saturns-moon-titan-drifting-away-faster-than-previously-thought" target="_blank">Titan and its other moons are moving away from Saturn faster than previously estimated</a>, at about 11 cm per year.

<p>In sales, business-to-business (B2B) lead generation refers to the first step of an outbound sales process. It consists of sourcing contact information about potential new customers.</p>

<p>B2B lead generation is an important step for both sales &amp; marketing teams. However, in this blog post, we will focus more on relevant tactics and strategies for B2B sales teams selling online (i.e. via email, social media, etc).</p>



<p>It’s simple. You don’t want to waste your team’s resources (money and time) selling ice to Eskimos. Even if you’re able to convince a few of them, they will soon realize that your product/service is useless to them.</p>

<p>Having a great lead generation process means getting the right people to use your product/service. This leads to higher conversion rates in your sales &amp; marketing funnels and happier customers to provide good reviews and referrals.</p>



<p>A great B2B lead generation process is able to generate a considerable amount of leads at the top of the funnel. Of course, numbers will differ a lot between companies and industries, but the idea is that you’re able to source enough leads and still make sure you are targeting the niche of customers that truly benefit from your product / service.</p>

<p>Your ultimate goal is to find <strong>the leads</strong> with the most potential to become your next customers, by looking for purchase intent signals online.</p>

<p>How? Let’s get practical with a few examples of B2B lead generation tactics.</p>



<h2 id="1generateleadsfrompeopleinteractingwithlinkedincontent">1. Generate leads from people interacting with LinkedIn content</h2>

<p>Every day, many professionals open their thoughts for discussion on LinkedIn. Every time this happens, lots of interactions are generated. </p>

<p>People that are liking or commenting on those thoughts are publicly showing alignment with a topic that is relevant to them. This opens the possibility to find an entire audience out there that might be ready to start a conversation with you. How amazing is that?</p>

<p>We’ve recently written an article about this lead generation strategy, you can follow the <a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/generate-leads-linkedin-content/?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">complete step-by-step guide</a> of this approach or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4yVFRuycZQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">watch our 15min webinar here</a>.</p>

<p>PS: If you’re already thinking about how you’ll have the time to gather data from all the profiles on these posts, here’s the solution. Extracting leads from LinkedIn content is a seamless experience with Amplemarket’s LinkedIn extension:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UMIcTfL.jpg" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="2generateleadsfromnewmanagersongrowingteams">2. Generate leads from new managers on growing teams</h2>

<p>Sales Navigator is a powerful tool for lead generation because LinkedIn has access to a lot of data that it’s virtually impossible to replicate. </p>

<p>This tactic uses Sales Navigator to find the decision-makers that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have available money to spend right now</li>
<li>Want to shake things up with new processes and tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, LinkedIn doesn’t give you the data like this, but there are 2 really good proxies you can use.</p>

<ol>
<li>Filter accounts by headcount growth and department headcount growth</li>
</ol>

<p>On account filters, you should target companies that are growing in general, but also in specific departments relevant to your product. This will signal higher purchase intent because growing teams are certainly looking to adopt new processes and tools to accommodate their tool.</p>

<ol>
<li>Filter leads by decision-makers that changed jobs in the last 90 days</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have your accounts list, you shouldn’t randomly target decision-makers within those companies. On lead filters, narrow to decision-makers that recently changed jobs. </p>

<p>Why? These people just entered a new role, on a growing team. This means, they are looking to shake things up internally and have available money to spend right now.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/how-to-find-purchase-intent-linkedin/?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">In this article about how to find purchase intent on Sales Navigator</a>, we explain this approach step-by-step. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xVPbzTX.jpg" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="3generateleadsfromconferenceattendees">3. Generate leads from conference attendees</h2>

<p>Industry-relevant events are a great way to connect with potential customers in your niche. Even with conferences going remote in 2020 (and expectably in 2021 too), this is a great opportunity to reach out to these people.</p>

<p>Using a lead generation tool like Amplemarket, you can easily filter for companies that are attending industry-relevant events. <a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">Check here</a> how this could work for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dBPC59D.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<p>You see? With a quick search, you can easily find hundreds or thousands of good leads to reach out to.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also purchase the tickets for each conference and have access to the attendees' page.</p>

<p>Still not convinced?</p>

<p>Some other great companies have tested this strategy with success. You can see what a <a href="http://goodsalesemails.com/campaigns/pandadoc-1?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">real outreach example from PandaDoc looks like here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4generateleadsfromconferencenonattendees">4. Generate leads from conference <em>non-attendees</em></h2>

<p>Many times, the decision-makers within your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) are not the ones attending the conferences. This strategy enables you to re-target companies that attended industry-relevant events with the "wrong" people. </p>

<p>Great! How?</p>

<p>You've got the companies from strategy #3. You just need to re-target your approach to decision-makers that better fit your ICP but didn't attend the conference and that's it!</p>

<p>In the end, you'll either have leads with more seniority or leads that belong to a different team.</p>

<p>Note: You can also add the companies that didn't convert in strategy #3.</p>



<p>Every day, you can find new lists online that feature / bundle companies in several topics. Depending on your industry, you might be interested in companies like: New Unicorn Companies in 2020 or Fortune 1000.</p>

<p>There are several ways you can find the relevant contacts for these companies. For instance, you may use advanced google searches or you may know some online resources. </p>

<p>Any tactic you choose, you can use these lists to leverage <em>relevancy</em> in a dedicated message.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Hint:</strong> You can add an extra point to relevancy and personalization if you know which technologies these companies use and you integrate with. </p>

<p>Note: Find this information on websites like Crunchbase, reviews pages like G2, Capterra, and Featured Customers, or on the tool's website under the customer testimonials section</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I found you on the 2020 Unicorns list"</em> - this alone might not be enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Adding more value:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Congrats, I just saw your company made into the Unicorns list in 2020. I’m reaching out because I see that you use {{tool}} which we integrate... "</em> - <strong>this type of message will make you stand out from the crowd</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On <a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo">Amplemarket</a>, we do this for you:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RizWaNy.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="6generateleadsfromyourparticipationinrelevantslacklinkedinandfacebookgroups">6. Generate leads from your participation in relevant Slack, LinkedIn, and Facebook groups</h2>

<p>Slack, LinkedIn and Facebook groups are a great and unexplored way of generating leads. While people ask questions about how to solve their issues, you can find unexplored opportunities by helping them out with your solution.</p>

<p>Whether your industry prefers Slack, LinkedIn or Facebook groups to hang out and debate relevant topics doesn’t really matter for the purpose of your lead generation efforts.</p>

<p>Example: For companies in the marketing technology industry, this Slack group has a channel where people share their issues with experts in the field. If your product solves the issue, you can easily jump into the conversation and potentially win a new customer. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZrvp8n.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<p>This strategy may not be the top source of leads in terms of volume, but with the right process, you can easily approach prospects that are just looking to solve the issue you solve for.</p>

<p>Manually checking for each message on the channel isn’t very efficient. With <a href="https://zapier.com/">zapier.com</a>, create customized notifications on your slack whenever someone mentions a relevant topic to you.</p>

<h2 id="7generateleadswhencompaniesareapprovingnewbudgets">7. Generate leads when companies are approving new budgets</h2>

<p>For most B2B SaaS companies the last 2 months of the year is a period when a lot of companies approve budgets, renew contracts, or evaluate new vendors for the upcoming new year. From a timing perspective, this is one of the best moments to jump into a conversation and eventually win some customers. </p>

<p>At this time of the year, you can easily search for companies using your competitor tools and create a dedicated message on Amplemarket. </p>

<p>Just as an example, a message like this will trigger their curiosity to learn more about your tool:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I noticed you’re using {{competitor_tool}}, I reached out because for a lot of companies the end of the year is usually a period when they evaluate renewals with vendors. Is that the case for {{competitor_tool}}? If so, I would love to connect, we at XYZ..."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="8generateleadsfromyourcompetitorproductreviews">8. Generate leads from your competitor product reviews</h2>

<p>Websites like <a href="https://www.g2.com/">G2</a>, <a href="https://www.capterra.com/">Capterra</a>, and <a href="https://www.featuredcustomers.com/">FeaturedCustomers</a> are a great knowledge source about your competitors. Not only you can use the reviews to learn more about issues that people usually feel, but you can also identify …</p></section></article></div></div>

How a brand is first positioned in the marketplace is often the snapshot people file in their minds.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, the same principles apply when branding a disease.</p>    <p>Maybe the best example is the Spanish Flu of 1918.</p>  <p>It is remembered as the deadliest pandemic in recent history, infecting one-third of the world's population and killing more than 50 million people worldwide. But the Spanish Flu has a very interesting — and telling — history. World War I&nbsp;was underway. As the pandemic began to spread like wildfire throughout Europe and the U.S., wartime media censorship was enforced.</p>  <p>Public officials in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States all chose to either suppress the pandemic news or downplay the severity of the virus.</p>  <p>The reason: Governments didn't want to lower morale or cause panic during the costliest war in history. That decision would eventually kill more people than the war itself.</p>  <p>The one country that wasn't subject to media censorship was Spain. It had declared itself neutral in the First World War. As a result, public officials and the Spanish press in Madrid reported freely on the pandemic as it spread through their country. Spain's King Alonso XIII also fell gravely ill due to the virus and that only heightened the attention.</p>  <p>This extensive — and almost solitary — reporting of the disease in May of 1918&nbsp;amidst a virtual media blackout in most other countries gave the world the false impression the disease had originated in Spain.</p>  <p>While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the 1918 pandemic, one thing was certain. It did not start in Spain.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Headlines proclaim the impact of the Spanish flu in Winnipeg on Oct. 26, 1918.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Manitoba Free Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>One of the earliest recorded outbreaks of the pandemic came from the United States. Specifically, rural Kansas, of all places. Soldiers were crowded into a training facility there and — on day one — hundreds of recruits started checking into the infirmary complaining of severe flu symptoms that included high fevers, violent coughing and excruciating pain.</p>  <p>Many of these young men were healthy farm boys who were suddenly flattened by the virus. 500 were bedridden by the end of the week.</p>  <p>When boatloads of American soldiers were shipped out, they took the virus with them. The influenza tore across Europe. It was so serious, it impacted the war, with over 200,000 French and British soldiers becoming too ill to fight. The British Grand Fleet could not even be put out to sea as 10,300 men reported sick. Soon, the German forces were felled with the same virus.</p>  <p>That summer, the influenza seemed to finally subside. But that hope was dashed when the pandemic came roaring back in the fall, more lethal than ever.</p>  <p>The link between the war and the virus was undeniable and crushing. Troops took the virus with them on ships, on trains, into the barracks and into the trenches. Then it jumped to China, India, Japan and the rest of Asia.</p>  <p>When Spanish Flu health messages of 1918 finally emerged, they looked strikingly similar to COVID-19 messages of today.</p>  <p>Newspaper ads implored people to wash their hands multiple times a day. People were asked to quarantine and not gather in groups. Other ads had big headlines saying, "Wear a mask and save your life!" There was disdain for people who flouted the rules.</p>  <p>Brands also picked up on the Spanish Flu name and reinforced it with the public. One typical ad said the virus came by way of Spain and stated: "The best way to stay safe was to apply Vicks VapoRub at the first sign of a cold."</p>  <p>Medical professionals and officials in Spain protested. They said the Spanish people were being falsely stigmatized. Not only did the flu <em>not</em> originate in Spain, the outbreak there was brief and was much more serious in other countries. Nonetheless, the worldwide media overwhelmed the facts.</p>  <p>If you've ever wondered about the staying power of a brand, the "Spanish Flu" is a case in point.</p>  <p>A full 100 years later, the "Spanish Flu" is still referenced — and still remains a source of irritation in Spain.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>For more stories about the Branding of Diseases, click or tap the "Listen" tab above to hear the full <a href="http://cbc.ca/undertheinfluence">Under the Influence</a> episode.

        <p>February 2021</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/jessewilson">Jesse Wilson</a> once said to me:
          </p>
          <p>

“What if we could give customers a button. They’d press it at the end of the year and it would automagically file their taxes for them.”
</p>
<p>
At the time I thought the idea was appealing, but didn’t think much more about it. Today, I think this is the way TurboTax gets dismantled. It’s taking consumer finance companies with massive distribution, combining them with a tax preparation API and real-time visibility into users tax position. Tackling TurboTax head on is probably a waste of money. Tackling TurboTax asymmetrically has a real shot.
</p>

<h2>TurboTax is functionally a monopoly</h2>
<p>
From the outside looking in, TurboTax has a near impregnable moat. In taxes, there’s no clear second player with near the level of distribution, automation, community, trustworthiness, brand recognition and regulatory capture that they have. They’re incredible at playing regulatory defense by constantly and subtly opposing any government efforts to simplify taxes[1], which simultaneously makes their product more valuable and raises the bar for new entrants. Even the Justice Department recognizes TurboTax as a functional monopoly, and forced Intuit to sell CreditKarma Tax in order to complete the acquisition.[2]

They’re also strong at sniping competition early, before it becomes a serious threat. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130808/a-techstars-first-startup-goodapril-gets-acquired-before-demo-day/">GoodApril</a> is an example; the company went through TechStars in 2013 and was focused on tax planning, initially for gig economy workers. Intuit acquired them before demo day, pre-empting their Series A.[3] 
</p>
<p>

More recently, from the outside looking in, you’d think they missed CreditKarma Tax by acquiring Credit Karma and selling the tax business to Cash App. I think more likely, CK gained scale before threatening Intuit by launching the tax product. The acquisition was at least valuable for a) securing CK’s distribution for TurboTax’s use and b) reducing the likelihood that a good competitor would emerge. You might bet that Cash App successfully executes on the transaction, but it’s at least not a guarantee, from Intuit’s perspective. 
</p><p>

TurboTax also owns the namespace for consumer taxes. Every year between January and April they become the top finance app and a top 10 app in the US Appstore. It’s possible someone builds a better direct to consumer product focused on tax prep, but I’m skeptical.
        </p>

          </p>
        <p>
            All things considered, I think TurboTax is a fantastic business, and will be tough to compete with head on. It’s more likely that the following pieces come together to obviate TurboTax.
</p>
          <p>

Consumer finance distribution + tax prep API + differentiated tax planning (eg real-time tax computation)


        </p>
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        
        <p>
Unseating TurboTax has been hard historically for a few reasons.
</p>

<h3>Superb distribution</h3>
<p>
As a startup, you have a 3.5 month window every year to acquire tax customers. During tax season, TurboTax already dominates the organic acquisition, Appstore rankings and paid acquisition channels. They’ve been doing it for years, they’re probably quite efficient, and you’re not going to outspend (or smartly out acquire) Turbotax from New Years day to tax day. [4]
</p>
      <div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/appstore.jpeg">
        </p>
        
      </div>
            
          

<h3>Perception &amp; Quality</h3>
<p>
Doing taxes well for mainstream consumers is complicated, and the consequences of getting them wrong are both bewildering and material. Every year the tax code gets more complex. This benefits the player who already has internally encoded the complexity, and for whom additional complexity is incremental rather than absolute (starting from 0). Simply put, you have one shot to build customer trust, and if you get it wrong you really screw up the customer’s life. Why would any consumer take that risk? 
</p>
<p>

TurboTax has been doing your taxes for years, already has your previous filings, and will use them to prefill tons of fields for you. All the while, you’ve probably never been audited. It just works.
</p>

<h2>It’s time to build (tax prep software)</h2>
<p>
To defeat TurboTax, a lot of the ingredients exist already. They’re just in the process of being assembled.
</p>

<h3>Consumer Finance Distribution</h3>
<p>
To defeat Turbotax, you need consumer distribution that’s as good or better than what TurboTax has. Without this, they’ll outspend you on customer acquisition every tax season, long before you can make a dent. It helps to already have established consumer trust with an adjacent offering, because if the only benefit of your product is tax preparation, you’ll be forced to acquire customers during tax season and compete head on, and you’ll be outspent.
</p>
<p>
Today, multiple consumer finance products already have the distribution necessary to compete. These include products like Cash App, Chime, Venmo, Robinhood and others, which have wide ranging customer trust and customer bases in the tens of millions each. Crucially, these products acquire customers upstream of tax season - they provide financial services to consumers all year around. They also already have a partial picture into a customer’s financial life, and they’re already thinking about customers’ tax needs. Cash App has taken a first party approach (by buying Credit Karma Tax).
</p>
<div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/robinhood.jpeg">
</p>
        
      </div>

<p>
 
Robinhood has taken a lead gen approach (by partnering with TurboTax). No one’s built on a tax API (because none currently exist). [5] For TurboTax this will be death by a thousand cuts - it will be years before a single player files more taxes than TurboTax. But the top 5 neobanks can drain enough volume to have a material impact.
</p>

<h3>Differentiated Tax Planning: Real time tax position</h3>
<p>
Turbotax is insanely focused on consumer tax needs during filing season. To date, this has been sufficient to win. Over the last 18 months, however, “new” things are possible around taxes that weren’t before. Today, high quality income and tax withholding data is available via API. With this data, you can compute your tax position in real time at any point in the year, which has two core financial benefits; a) you can know your tax liability at any point in the year with reasonable precision, and b) with that knowledge, you can optimize it. For instance, you could build a continuous W2 with Pinwheel’s <a href="https://docs.getpinwheel.com/docs/api/reference/pinwheel-api.v1.json/paths/~1accounts~1%7Baccount_id%7D~1paystubs/get">paystubs endpoint.</a>
</p>
<p>
This financial benefit wasn’t possible before the last couple of years, and it’s outside of TurboTax’s wheelhouse, because TurboTax optimizes and monetizes the tax transaction at year end, and essentially re-acquires taxpayers each season. Outside of tax season, I basically don’t log into TurboTax.
</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of years, several companies have emerged that provide programmatic, API based access to high quality income and wage data for consumers, including <a href="https://www.getpinwheel.com/">Pinwheel</a> (where I’m invested), <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a>, and <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a>. I suspect <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/deposit-switch/">Plaid's deposit switch</a> team will eventually offer this as well.


Any consumer finance company can now provide a few foundational benefits to customers: 
</p><ul>
<li>Building the customer’s tax forms (eg W2 or 1099) continuously throughout the year using their payroll data</li>
<li>Providing the user a rolling, real-time view of their tax position (taxes owed, refunds) as they earn and spend throughout the year</li>
<li>Trust from the customer that you’re the right company to help file their taxes at year end. At year end - customers press a button, answer some qualifying questions, and electronically file the taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
On top of these foundational benefits, there’s even more financial benefits that can be built. These are less straightforward, but no less valuable:
</p><ul>
<li><span>Tax refund factoring;</span> providing consumers access to refunds prior to tax season. There’s a bunch of regulatory complexity here and some fraud to account for, including users omitting crucial info to overstate their refunds. </li>
<li><span>Tax optimization;</span> recommending changes to income and spend behavior to improve year end tax liability positioning. This already happens a lot at the high end through concepts like tax loss harvesting and smb expense write offs; it’s just rarer for regular W2 and 1099 earners. In today’s world, by the time you’re logging into TurboTax, you’ve missed any shot at optimizing your tax position. Optimizations include amounts to save in tax advantaged accounts like HSA’s and 401Ks, tax allowances you’re eligible for, etc.</li>
<li><span>Spend categorization for tax purposes;</span> paired with an issued card, you can help categorize transactions and suggest which to save receipts for at year end. Mint and other PFMs focus on transaction categorization for budgeting; no one’s really focused on it for personal taxes. [6]</li>
<li><span>Advance capital gains optimisation;</span> tax loss harvesting tools exist, but with where rates are now there are interesting package strategies to allow customers finance instead of selling assets.[7] This starts with creating a live Schedule D and some scenario analysis tools which show customers their alternatives to getting cash today.</li>
</ul>


<p>
At its heart, this approach reaches the customer for a tax use case upstream of when TurboTax acquires them. This means a) you’re not competing at the time of year when TurboTax’s acquisition dollars will drown you, and b) you’re acquiring the customer mid-year, before taxes consume their attention. The best time to optimize your taxes are long before you have to pay them, and neobanks are well placed to provide this benefit.
</p>

<h2>What’s missing: tax preparation as an API</h2>
<p>
Today, there are lots of companies providing tax filing APIs, that would allow a tax preparer electronically file taxes that have already been prepared. From what I can see, no one’s building an API that manages the preparation of taxes. At a minimum you need a system that 
</p><ul>
<li>takes the various inputs (1099, W2 etc) and computes a tax position
asks a series of leading questions to learn more about the consumer (things like whether you’re married, head of household etc) to improve the tax …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>As a software engineer, I have spent (I figure) more than 10,000 hours writing
code, deconstructing simple to complex problems into pieces then weaving them
carefully together to create a program. It occurred to me that any piece of code
that is broken into different parts which call each other is itself a graph or
network. As my software career has also been firmly rooted in open-source,
I wondered what these graphs would look like for some of the most popular 
open-source projects. Being also a data engineer, and someone who has focused 
on development in the Java language, I decided to look at projects centered 
around data written in Java.</p>

<p>There are really two parts to doing this. First, find a way to parse Java code to
extract its network of logic. And second, to visualize then analyze it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the difficult part of #1 has already been done. The github project 
<a href="https://github.com/gousiosg/java-callgraph">java-callgraph</a> by Dr. Georgios Gousios
will read through a jar file, and output a file describing its class and method
references. Great! I also want to thank the tremendous amount of effort that has 
been put into these open-source projects. Without them, most of what I do in my 
job would not be possible.</p>



<p>Once I compiled the java-callgraph project and ran it against a jar file, I then 
had to write code which could parse that output and save it in a graph file format 
that Gephi could read for the visualization. A couple hours of coding/testing later 
and I had a nice flexible tool that could do this (as well as store it in any graph
database I want that's supported by the <a href="http://www.tinkerpop.com/">Tinkerpop Framework</a>).</p>

<p>Simply loading the entire graph leads to two main network components (two
separated graph sections). That's because java-callgraph maps two types of
connections: class dependencies, and method calls. For simplicity reasons, I
chose to just focus on the class dependency aspect of the code graph where a
more pronounced topology appears. Another post sometime looking at the method
call graphs would be interesting. I also am filtering the nodes to only those
authored by the project itself rather than dependencies it has to the native
Java classes or other libraries.</p>



<p>I'm doing a pretty simple visualization: coloring based on simple community
detection, force separation layout, and sizing the nodes based on degree (in
this case, in-degree to highlight the classes most frequently referenced).</p>



<p>Here are the results.</p>





<p>Hadoop is a wildly popular framework that provides reliable, scalable,
distributed computing. It has had a very disruptive effect on how data is used
across diverse fields and industries. Often when people use the buzzword 
"Big Data" the technology they are describing includes Hadoop in some way.</p>

<p>For this one, I used the hadoop-core v4.3.7 library.</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/hadoop-core-import-graph.png" alt="hadoop code graph network"></p>

<p>The top ten most referenced classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.util.StringUtils</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.io.Text</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.classification.InterfaceAudience</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.util.ReflectionUtils</li>
</ol>

<p>Prominent communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pink-purple community on the left roughly correlates to the HDFS,
datanode/namenode code.</li>
<li>The green community on the right has much of the map-reduce server code.</li>
<li>The yellow community at the top is mostly the map-reduce client and tracking code. </li>
<li>The red community at the top has a lot of map-reduce lib code. </li>
<li>The maroon community in the lower-left is the record.compiler package which is 
actually it's own isolated component.</li>
<li>And the violet community between the pink and maroon communities contains the HDFS 
web classes. </li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Spark brings many of the same concepts of reliable, scalable, distributed
computing and adapts it to the reality of falling RAM prices. As a result
you can experience 10-100x performance improvements in the latency of
distributed jobs which before worked primarily against disk in a Hadoop
environment. It isn't a competitor to Hadoop as much as it is an augmentation of
its capabilities; and it is showing tremendous potential to be just as
transformative as Hadoop was itself.</p>

<p>Here's the class import graph for spark-core v2.10-1.1.0:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/spark-core-import-graph.png" alt="spark code graph network"></p>

<p>This has some unique characteristics in its graph with nodes which fan out to
many other nodes. I believe this can be attributed to its being written in
Scala and the way that Scala code is packaged in jars.</p>

<p>Here are the top ten most referenced classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.apache.spark.Logging</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD (Note: Spark is an implementation of
the <a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ematei/papers/2012/nsdi_spark.pdf">RDD specification</a>)</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.util.Utils</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.util.JsonProtocol</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.SparkConf</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.ui.jobs.UIData</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.SparkContext</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.network.ConnectionManager</li>
</ol>

<p>Some prominent communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The green community on the right (not the top) generally has most of the RDD classes.</li>
<li>The pink/purple community below it is mostly made up of the spark.deploy 
package with master/worker code.</li>
<li>The purple community below it is made up of spark.ui package.</li>
<li>The yellow community in the upper left is mostly the spark.storage package.</li>
<li>The pink community on the left has the spark.scheduler package.</li>
<li>The darker purple community on the bottom has a lot of classes involved in
tracking/reporting job progress and task execution.</li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Cassandra is a distributed, reliable, and highly scalable columnar storage
engine which grew out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)">Amazon Dynamo</a>
specification. It too has been transformative and is used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra#Prominent_users">many companies and
institutions</a>
in many different industries and fields.</p>

<p>I looked at Cassandra v2.1.1 to create this class import graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/cassandra-import-graph.png" alt="cassandra code graph network"></p>

<p>The top ten most referenced classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.exceptions.InvalidRequestException</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.utils.ByteBufferUtil</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.config.CFMetaData</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamilyStore</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamily</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.utils.FBUtilities</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.config.DatabaseDescriptor</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.composites.CellNameType</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.Cell</li>
</ol>

<p>And a few of its communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The blue community in the upper-left, is made up of cassandra.transport and cassandra.cql.</li>
<li>The green community in the center contains cassandra.thrift, cassandra.hadoop, and cassandra.cli.</li>
<li>The yellow-ish orange community in the lower right is mostly cassandra.db, cassandra.io, and cassandra.utils.memory.</li>
<li>The orange community on the right is a mixture of packages involving SSTables and compaction.</li>
<li>The red community on the bottom is mostly NodeTool classes.</li>
<li>The reddish pink community on the left has cassandra.cql3 classes.</li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Neo4j is a leading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph database</a>.
Graph databases have gained popularity recently as highly interconnected datasets 
and use cases to understand those connections have grown. Big drivers for 
this are the rise of social media, increasingly interconnected datasets, 
and advances in systems sciences. This is the "problem of organized 
complexity" described by Warren Weaver. I go more into this in my 
<a href="http://allthingsgraphed.com/about">about page</a>. I've also done an 
<a href="http://allthingsgraphed.com/2014/10/23/intro-to-graphs/">intro to graph databases</a> which talks about 
what graph databases, gives examples of how they've been used, and frames 
the history of graph/network science (see first part of that video).</p>

<p>For Neo4j, I used v2.1.4 of it's kernel library:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/neo4j-kernel-import-graph.png" alt="neo4j code graph network"></p>

<p>The top most referenced classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.util.StringLogger</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.Function</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.Predicate</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.collection.IteratorUtil</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.collection.Iterables</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.StoreChannel</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.Record</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.FileSystemAbstraction</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.transaction.xaframework.LogEntry</li>
<li>org.neo4j.graphdb.Path</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of its communities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The green community on the bottom has much of the kernel.api and kernel.impl packages.</li>
<li>The red community on the right has neo4j.unsafe.impl.batchimport, kernel.impl.nioneo, 
and neo4j.helpers.</li>
<li>The orange community above that has a lot of kernel.impl.storemigration, 
kernel.impl.transaction, and kernel.impl.nioneo.store</li>
<li>The blue community in the upper-right has kernel.impl.transaction and 
kernel.impl.nioneo.xa.</li>
<li>Moving to the left, the yellow community has much of the graphdb.traversal classes.</li>
<li>Below that, the sea-green community has classes in the top-level neo4j.graphdb 
package, also has some in graphdb.traversal, and contains kernel.impl.core.</li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine. It has
become quite popular for real-time log analysis and visualization and is
commonly combined with <a href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a> and 
<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/">kibana</a> (making the ELK stack).</p>

<p>This is what the class import graph looks like for Elasticsearch 1.4.0:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/elasticsearch-import-graph.png" alt="elasticsearch code graph network"></p>

<p>Top classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.StreamOutput</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.StreamInput</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentBuilder</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.logging.ESLogger</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.ToXContent</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.ToXContent$Params</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchException</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.base.Preconditions</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of its communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The yellow community on the bottom is mostly elasticsearch.common.netty.</li>
<li>The orange community on the left is elasticsearch.search.</li>
<li>The blue community is a combination of elasticsearch.action, elasticsearch.cluster,
elasticsearch.discovery, elasticsearch.gateway, elasticsearch.index/indecies, 
elasticsearch.river, elasticsearch.snapshots, and elasticsearch.transport 
(a higher resolution of community detection would probably break these apart).</li>
<li>The red community on the right has the client and REST interface classes.</li>
<li>The purple …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Plugin GraphQL API for WordPress is now scoped. This means the plugin can be finally uploaded to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/talking-business.jpg" alt="Talking business" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"></p><p>To do it, I'm using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>. Using this library with WordPress does not go without its challenges, so I'll explain in this blog post how I managed to pull it out.</p><p>Sections:</p><ul><li><a href="#heading-taking-the-decision-to-scope">Taking the decision to scope</a></li><li><a href="#heading-checking-out-the-options">Checking out the options</a></li><li><a href="#heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing">Trying out Mozart, and failing</a></li><li><a href="#heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic">Checking PHP-Scoper, and coming out in panic</a></li><li><a href="#heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good">Coming back to PHP-Scoper, this time for good</a></li><li><a href="#heading-php-scoper-the-easy-way">PHP-Scoper, the easy way 😎</a> 👈🏽 Here starts my solution</li><li><a href="#heading-show-me-the-real-stuff">Show me the real stuff</a></li><li><a href="#heading-testing">Testing</a></li><li><a href="#heading-check-out-the-results">Check out the results</a></li></ul><h2 id="heading-taking-the-decision-to-scope">Taking the decision to scope<a href="#heading-taking-the-decision-to-scope"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>A few weeks ago, Matt Mullenweg announced he'll be <a href="https://youtu.be/QI3qCoiuG3w?t=2268">keeping an eye on "the GraphQL plugin"</a>, obviously referring to <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a>. His expression demonstrates that he believes there is only one GraphQL plugin, when in fact there are two (the one left out is, well, mine). That made me realize how little visibility my plugin has, and I felt bad about it.</p><p>Matt didn't know my plugin existed. Nor does most of the WordPress community, for that matter. Clearly I'm not publicizing it well enough. I know that I suck in marketing and social media; I'm just OK with technical stuff (or so I believe). So I decided to do something about it, at least within my capabilities.</p><p>So this is what I'm working on:</p><ul><li>I just finished coding this same website, <a href="https://graphql-api.com/">graphql-api.com</a>, and launched it 2 weeks ago (yay! 🥳 Btw, how do you like it? Be welcome to give me feedback, via <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz/">DM</a> or <a href="mailto:leo@getpop.org">email</a>)</li><li>3 days ago, I finally started scoping the plugin, and finished this task yesterday! (At 3 am, but it was worth it 😅)</li><li>And finally, I'm already working on the upcoming version <code>0.8</code>, which will be the first one available in the plugin repository</li></ul><p>Scoping the plugin is mandatory to upload it to the repository, because otherwise it could conflict with a different plugin, which requires the same dependency as my plugin, but with a different version. Having done it is a really big milestone; no other development is as important. For instance, I must still complete the GraphQL schema to fully match the WordPress data model, but that will be done steadily on each new release.</p><p>So in a few weeks from now, the plugin will show up when searching for "GraphQL", and the people who are actually needing to implement a GraphQL API will get to know of my plugin's existence.</p><p>Indeed, I do want my plugin to be seriously considered for the future of WordPress. I've been working on it for several years now. <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP">The repo</a> was started back in August 2016; that is even before WPGraphQL existed, and at the beginning of GraphQL. But I didn't know that the project would become a GraphQL server; it took that direction only around 1.5 years ago.</p><p>(The project is actually a framework to build applications using server-side components, and a GraphQL server could perfectly be built using this architecture. So then I just built it).</p><p>WPGraphQL is an established plugin, and rightly so: it was started a few years ago, and a community was built around it. The work by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbahl">Jason Bahl</a> (who is employed by Gatsby) and <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/graphs/contributors">the contributors to his project</a> has been outstanding: integrating WordPress into the Jamstack is now easier than ever.</p><p>But one thing is Gatsby and the Jamstack, and another thing is WordPress. WordPress is 40% of the web, not just an input to a static site generator.</p><p>So now, we can consider if WPGraphQL is the right option, without having this decision taken for us out of lack of alternatives. We can now analyze both plugins to see whose goals are more aligned to what's important for WordPress.</p><p>The GraphQL API for WordPress can also work with the Jamstack. But its main objectives are, I believe, more splendid: To "democratize data publishing", so that editing an API becomes as easy as editing a post (something everyone can do), and to make WordPress become the OS of the web.</p><p>Once the plugin is available on the repository, I hope more people will try it out and say "Hey, this is so friking awesome! How comes I didn't know about this stuff before?".</p><p>And then, the choice of "the GraphQL plugin" is not pre-determined, and the WordPress community can consider both WPGraphQL and the GraphQL API for WordPress based on their own merits.</p><p>Now that my motivations are out of the way, let's talk technical stuff 🤓.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-out-the-options">Checking out the options<a href="#heading-checking-out-the-options"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Scoping a plugin involves running some tooling, that takes the plugin code as input, and spits out the scoped plugin. No big deal, right? How hard can that be?</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/dog-scope-plugin.jpg" alt="Talking technical" loading="lazy" width="505" height="494"></p><p>Well, depending on the codebase, just executing the scope command alone won't be enough. After that, we need to check for errors in the console, fix them, test the application thoroughly, identify errors and why they happen, fix them, and iterate. To get it completely right, it might require some time.</p><p>There are 2 libraries for scoping, which have different goals:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart">Mozart</a>, for WordPress code</li><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>, for any PHP code, particularly when producing PHARs</li></ul><p>Because I have a WordPress plugin, I tried out Mozart first. Let's see how it fared.</p><h2 id="heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing">Trying out Mozart, and failing<a href="#heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>I tried Mozart around 1 year ago. For what it says in the documentation, "the <code>mozart compose</code> command does all the magic". So I expected it all to be very quick and simple, and go enjoy a daiquiri for the rest of the day.</p><p>Alas, Mozart never worked for my codebase. It kept running into issues, so the scoping never materialized. And I couldn't get the required assistance: I submitted a PR, but <a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart/pull/36#issuecomment-633013728">it was not considered for merging</a>, and I was not even notified about it, so I kept waiting until I naturally lost interest in this project.</p><p>I believe that Mozart couldn't handle some of the dependencies in my plugin. I'm making use of several of Symfony's components, including <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html">Cache</a> and <a href="https://github.com/symfony/dotenv">Dotenv</a>, with everything managed through Composer.</p><p>Scoping PHP is not just about PHP, so the scoper will have many hurdles to avoid and challenges to solve. For instance, Symfony DependencyInjection uses <code>YAML</code> files to set-up configuration, and these must be scoped too. And the <code>composer.json</code> file contains the configuration for <code>PSR-4</code> autoloading, and this must be scoped too. And, I believe, Mozart couldn't handle these complexities properly.</p><p>But I'm sure that my experience is not the only one, and that there are many happy users our there. Also, my failed attempt happened 1 year ago, so I wonder if the tool has been improved since then. And then, don't forget the saying: "All scoped plugins are alike; each unscoped plugin is unscoped in its own way", so possibly it fails just for me.</p><p>If your WordPress plugin is simple, with self-contained logic, and scoping must be performed within PHP code only, then chances are that Mozart will work. You just gotta find out.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic">Checking PHP-Scoper, and coming out in panic<a href="#heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So I headed for PHP-Scoper. However, I never even tried to try it, because I got frightened immediately by it.</p><p>To start with, <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper#wordpress">this tool does not naturally support WordPress</a>. And to continue, they recommend to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/Makefile">their own Makefile</a>, which looks like this:</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --warn-undefined-variables</span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --no-builtin-rules</span><br><span></span><br><span>.DEFAULT_GOAL :<span>=</span> <span>help</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>PHPBIN</span><span>=</span>php</span><br><span><span>PHPNOGC</span><span>=</span>php -d zend.enable_gc<span>=</span><span>0</span></span><br><span><span>IS_PHP8</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span>shell php -r <span>"echo version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '8.0.0', '&gt;=') ?

It looks like a riddle. Believing that I needed to understand that code just to scope my plugin, made me flee unceremoniously.</p><p>(Well, understanding that code is their recommendation to test the scoped application, but it is not required. We can also just run the command <code>php-scoper add-prefix</code>, let it do all the magic, and go drink our daiquiris.)</p><h2 id="heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good">Coming back to PHP-Scoper, this time for good<a href="#heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, 3 days ago, I took a decision to implement scoping, somehow. I had to make it happen.</p><p>I came back to PHP-Scoper, to try it out in earnest. I knew that WordPress could be scoped with it from reading <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/php-scoper-namespace-composer-depencies/">PHP Scoper: How to Avoid Namespace Issues in your Composer Dependencies</a> (by the brilliant folks from Delicious Brains). It was just a matter of attitude, and perseverence.</p><p>I explored some of the existing solutions, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/442#issuecomment-736598602">This one</a> by Lucas Bustamante</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/11.3/src/config/dependency-management.php">This one</a> by Yoast</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/80e3bd88317bf20bc5e5d6600428692fa8e3fc08/includes/loader.php">This one</a> by Google Site Kit</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/web-stories-wp/blob/main/scoper.inc.php">This one</a> by Google Web Stories</li></ul><p>But they all look not fully satisfying to me: either the code seems hacky, or fragile and waiting to break at some time or another.</p><p>For instance, the Google Web Stories plugin scopes the code, and then reverts back each one of the conflicts:</p><pre><code><span><span>return</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>  <span>'patchers'</span>                   <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>		<span>function</span> <span>(</span> <span>$file_path</span><span>,</span> <span>$prefix</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br>			<br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\_doing_it_wrong"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\_doing_it_wrong'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\__"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\__'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html_e"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html_e'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_attr"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_attr'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_url"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_url'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      <span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\do_action"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\do_action'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      </span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>]</span></span></code></pre><p>I understand why they do it, but I don't like it. Whenever a new WordPress function gets referenced, they need to make sure it also makes it to this list. It's too manual, too fragile.</p><p>So this was my challenge: Isn't there a simpler way to scope a plugin, and relying on code that we can present to our friends and colleagues …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this short guide I will show you how to quickly install an OpenVPN
 server using an existing Docker image. It is possible to install an 
OpenVPN server, but with Docker everything is much easier. You don't 
need to buy a third party service, everything is completely free.</p><p>You
 must have your own VPS server. If not, you can buy a VPS on 
DigitalOcean. You can buy the least expensive from
 $2 to $5 per month.</p><p>I will use an off-the-shelf VPN solution built on Docker: <a href="https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn" target="_blank">https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn</a><br></p><p><br>All you need for the first step is to install Docker. I use Ubuntu OS.<br>If Docker is installed, let's move on to the next step.</p><p>I will use the following variables: <br></p><p><b>ovpn-data-example-uk</b> - It is for data volume container.</p><p><b>vpn.yourdomain.com</b> - The value should be a domain name or IP Address.</p><p><b>uk.vpn.yourdomain.com</b> - It’ll be used as a client definition.<br></p><p><i>These variables are test variables. You must use your variables.</i><br></p>

<p>Let’s begin by creating docker volume.</p>
<pre>docker volume create --name ovpn-data-example-uk</pre>

<p>The next step is to initialize the container.</p>

<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_genconfig \
        -u udp://vpn.yourdomain.com</pre><p>The container will ask you for a passphrase to protect the private key used by the newly generated certificate authority.</p>

<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    -it \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_initpki</pre><p>After the previous process finished, we can start the OpenVPN server process.<br>
</p><pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    -d \
    -p 1194:1194/udp \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    kylemanna/openvpn</pre><p>We can generate a client certificate without a passphrase to be used on our local machine.<br></p>


<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    -it \
    kylemanna/openvpn \

Above-average compensation makes it easier to turn positive cash flow into investment capital that compounds over time. But more critically, owning equity in a startup offers an outside chance of exponentially increasing the financial baseline from which future compounding occurs.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a great startup mind does not necessarily translate into mastery of our complex financial and tax systems. Fortunately, there are a number of parallels between building startups and building wealth at startups that can help make the wealth building process a bit more intuitive.</p><p>The framework we’re introducing in this essay, <em>The Continuum of Building Wealth at Startups</em>, is borrowed from Will Larson’s approach to managing engineering teams outlined in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186/"><em>An Elegant Puzzle</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whether building products or building wealth, you need to know where you are before you can figure out the appropriate steps to reach your desired outcome. Like building a great product, you will need to put together a team with the skill sets that will best fit the financial future you want to build. And, like a product, your financial future will constantly evolve as you learn more about what’s possible.<br></p><h4><strong>Teams, a Continuum with Four States</strong></h4><p>Larson offers a model for viewing engineering teams on a continuum with four states:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Falling Behind</strong> (growing backlog of work)</li><li><strong>Treading Water</strong> (tackling critical work but not technical debt)</li><li><strong>Repaying Debt</strong> (paying down technical debt to create capacity for core product work)</li><li><strong>Innovating</strong> (creating something new because of sustainably low technical debt)</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d60577d7a6c5d1ac084a849/6033f615e2aa87a35299461d_Continuum%20of%20Building%20Wealth.PNG" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>p 36</figcaption></figure><p>He writes “Teams want to climb from falling behind to innovating, while entropy drags them backward. Each state requires a different tact.” When a team is falling behind, it may be necessary to add more engineers. Treading water might require focusing on the core obstacle to scale and begin repaying debt. Innovation is possible when teams correctly navigate the different states of the continuum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the risk of applying Larson’s map too literally, there are insights when used as a continuum of building sustainable wealth at startups.<br></p><h4><strong>Wealth, a Continuum with Four States</strong></h4><p><strong>1. Falling Behind</strong>, whether subjectively or objectively, can be a difficult burden. A variety of factors might influence it from a financial standpoint. Maybe salary from the current startup doesn’t even cover the bills or allow for 401(k) contributions. You may have launched a company that is yet to turn a profit and the debt is piling up. Or the opportunity cost of the current gig is unsettling relative to peers at FAANGs or other recently coronated unicorns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: In these situations, it’s important to focus on building resilience. Specifically, accumulating cash to lengthen the runway. It’s impossible to know what decisions or bets will pay off in the future. Building a safety net allows you to trust your intuition instead of letting scarcity drive your decisions.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>: </em>A financial coach or hourly financial planner (generalist) should be able to help with these needs. The goal is to establish or refine habits that will help transition to treading water with positive momentum. Relying on a TurboTax-like automated return preparer is probably sufficient unless you’re exercising ISOs or making an 83(b) election.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>2. Treading Water</strong> means there’s enough excess cash flow to meet current goals and obligations. But it may not feel like there’s enough forward momentum for things to be materially different in the near-term. You might be paying off the student loans on schedule, but they remain uncomfortably high. You may have a large number of vesting stock options but it isn’t clear when to exercise them or if they are even worth exercising in the first place.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: Decisions in this state set the foundation and create the ability to take risks over a longer timescale. Understanding conflicts in resource allocation over the next 3-5 years becomes a superpower. It also determines the investment risk allocated toward startup equity. An exit may be 3+ years down the road, but establishing systems in advance of the “yikes, my company just filed their S-1” scramble can be worth its weight in long-term capital gains rates (or QSBS exemptions).</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>:</em> This level of complexity may justify upgrading to a human tax preparer and certainly justifies proactive tax planning. For quality tax planning, look for a tax preparer (CPA or EA) or a financial planner (CFP®) specializing in equity compensation. If there isn’t much complexity beyond equity compensation, layering an automated investment solution (like Wealthfront or Betterment) on top of the tax planning is a great starting step to diversify across the public markets. <em>*Endnote has more info on types of firms and professionals that provide advice*</em><br></p><p><strong>3. Repaying Debt</strong> with new cash might be possible due to a promotion or a moderate liquidity event. Debt is commonly financial, but it could also be social or physical from years of deprioritizing your health and personal relationships. Repayment could look like eliminating student loans, taking a sabbatical for self-care, or reducing barriers to do something new in the future.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: Wise capital allocation is necessary for making the most of this state. Because repaying debt is often early evidence of scale, the advice is most useful when highly personalized and provided by niche expertise. Progress down the wrong path can be as frustrating as no progress at all. At this point, inefficiency and miscommunication are increasingly expensive. Greater complexity could warrant building a core team for tax return prep, tax strategy, financial planning, and investment management.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>: </em>If looking for a one-stop solution, a boutique RIA<em>*</em> or large, multi-billion-dollar RIA<em>*</em> would provide the best experience. The best firms that specialize in startup wealth will do tax work in-house and operate as a board of directors for your household’s wealth. They may not handle everything directly, but they ensure continuity. The downside is that many larger RIAs have investment minimums, so hiring them may need to wait until a larger exit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who prefer a DIY approach could hire an accounting firm<em>*</em> and pair that with DIY investing at a custodian<em>*</em> like Fidelity or Vanguard. Assets could also be parked at a wirehouse/bank<em>*</em>, like Morgan Stanley or First Republic, for more transactional investment services. This path is naturally less personalized, but some perks include niche banking features and discounts on lending rates. The responsibility of being proactive remains with you because of the nature of these types of relationships and the underlying business models.<br></p><p><strong>4. Innovating</strong> is easiest after a large exit or when investment capital produces enough cash flow to cover all lifestyle expenses. Uncertainty becomes less threatening because fewer things in the future need to be true to facilitate an experience you’d be happy with. You have the freedom to extend the timescale for strategic bets and leverage human capital for outsized impact and returns. New baselines of wealth allow for significantly greater control over your future and the financial flexibility that may have been unthinkable in the past.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: Advice in this state will be oriented around maintaining this state. To operate from a place of abundance over long periods of time, strategies should be comprehensive and coherent. Everything from customized investment strategies to risk management and estate planning to tax planning should be operationally efficient and aligned with your values.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>: </em>The same options make sense as for Repaying Debt but, depending on the size of the exit and desired client experience, a Family Office<em>*</em> style firm may be wise. A Family Office<em> </em>has a high-touch client experience like a boutique RIA does and offers a broader set of services such as lifestyle management and household staffing.<br></p><h4><strong>Deciding What’s Right for You</strong></h4><p>From a “jobs to be done” perspective, it’s important to prioritize function over features. Function helps you develop an intuitive understanding of trade-offs so you’re more confident navigating the continuum. Features are helpful to the extent they help staying engaged with the core function.&nbsp;</p><p>If DIY is not your style, be thoughtful about the team you put together. Consider the culture of the firm(s) you hire, their experience working with people like you, or alignment on the fundamental value exchange in the relationship. As part of due diligence, we encourage you to learn about the incentive structures and business model of the firm(s) you hire and make sure they always put your interest ahead of their own (not just when convenient). As you get the right team in place, you can be more attuned to what’s next.<br></p><h4><strong>Where Upstart Shines</strong></h4><p>We are world class at our craft but we aren’t right for everyone.</p><p>We work best with people who thrive on collaborative relationships and proactive planning. We do not have investment minimums and instead use complexity as a barometer for whether we’re the best fit for a prospective client. Upstart is structured to build long-term win-win relationships, whether that begins when a client is treading water or when they want help innovating.&nbsp;</p><p>Positioned somewhere between the boutique RIA and a Family Office, we serve as our client’s core team for strategizing about money and life. Our service offering reflects what we have learned is most relevant for folks in tech. Beyond the in-house tax return prep, this includes customized investment strategies - like integrating personal ESG values and managing concentrated stock positions - through individualized planning frameworks to navigate meaningful financial transitions from first principles.</p><p>A startup …</p></div></div>

            <div><p>These days the word "sustainability" gets thrown around a lot with respect to free and open source software (FOSS). What is sustainability, and what does it mean for your project?</p>

<p>The concept of sustainability didn't originate in the 1980s, but it gained a lot of mindshare at that time thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future" target="blank">Brundtland Report</a>, which was released by the United Nations in 1987 after three years of research by a cross-functional team of scientists, policy makers, and business people. The report defines sustainability as "…development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</p>

<h2>The Sustainability Spectrum</h2>

<p>The development in question here is corporate, but this definition applies well to FOSS development also. However, across different projects the practical interpretation of the definition will look very different. At one end of the spectrum, for a small but popular Python library, sustainability may mean increasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" target="blank">bus factor</a> by doubling the number of core contributors, avoiding maintainer burnout, and thereby ensuring there will always be someone available to work on the project. Achieving this could require additional documentation, automation, and training in how to mentor new contributors, so it's not necessarily something that a project can do overnight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, there are projects like <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="blank">Blender</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="blank">Let's Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="blank">Inkscape</a>, and <a href="https://signal.org/" target="blank">Signal</a>. Relative to the number of users of these projects (frequently counted in the millions), they have few contributors (no more than a few hundred). Bringing on more contributors could be a goal for these mega-projects, but it may be a lower priority than providing for community and financial independence, scaling up infrastructure, or contracting for key development.</p>

<p>Frequently, discussions of FOSS sustainability end up couched in financial terms, but as you can see from the examples above it's not that simple. Paying a maintainer is great, but it doesn't contribute to the sustainability of a project if that maintainer is still working themselves to death trying to keep up with even basic project and community maintenance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Focusing primarily on money ignores critical sustainability elements such as <a href="https://archive.org/details/ato2019-successionplanning" target="blank">project succession planning</a>, which can provide breathing space for the maintainers of today while guaranteeing there will be maintainers to continue carrying the project into the future. This is a people problem, not necessarily a financial one, and it's complex.</p>

<h2>4 Big Questions</h2>

<p>In fact, upon closer inspection many projects may find that their path to sustainability involves a combination of people and financial elements that need to be balanced and prioritized. This inspection itself can be a difficult process, but it gets a little easier if the project community works its way through the Big Four Questions of FOSS sustainability:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Where is the project now? </strong>Now, be honest…what's the real state of the project at the moment? What are its pain points and bottlenecks? How many contributors are there and how do they feel? What sort of technical debt is the project carrying, including important but frequently overlooked things like documentation, user experience, security, and accessibility?</li>
	<li><strong>Where does the project want to be?</strong> Every project maintainer carries a "One day…what if…" picture of the project in their head. Share those pictures with the community—no matter how unrealistic they may seem right now. Have an open dialogue to coalesce all these pictures into one shared image that can act as an answer to "what do we want the project to be when it grows up." That image isn't a reality, and may not be for several years yet, but it can unify the community toward a common goal and help set a direction to better ensure the project evolves in a sustainable way.</li>
	<li><strong>How does the project get from where it is now to where we want it to be?</strong> Here's where the prioritization and balancing act comes in. You're probably familiar with creating a roadmap for software development, listing out a plan of features to work on and in which order. In answering this question you're creating a roadmap for project development. "Double number of core contributors" is a good feature for that roadmap, but it may have prerequisites and dependencies on "add contributor documentation" and "increase test coverage." Similarly, "Reach $25000 USD in yearly donations" can help to pay for scaling infrastructure, but it has its own dependency on "create a non-profit" or "find a fiscal sponsor," since managing that amount of money and the taxes involved aren't a trivial matter. Just as with software, thinking through these dependencies in advance can make project development less frustrating and more successful.</li>
	<li><strong>How does the project stay where we want it to be?</strong> Finally, this is the sustainability question. You can't answer this one—how the project can meet the needs of the present without compromising future needs—without answering the previous three questions. Thankfully, in answering the first three, most projects find that they've already been chipping away at this question. Answering it becomes a matter of sitting down and collecting all the existing thoughts, sharing them with the community, and revisiting them regularly to make sure the project is still on track toward sustainability.</li>
</ol><h2>Plan Your Approach</h2>

<p>Where are we now, where are we going, how will we get there, and how will we stay there? Being able to answer these questions is very empowering and can lead to stronger, more sustainable projects and communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How long it takes to answer these questions will depend a lot on the project, its needs, and its culture. Some will feel comfortable with something more agile, developing minimally viable plans and then iterating on them on a regular basis. Others may prefer a waterfall approach, coming up with a detailed roadmap to impress potential sponsors and contributors. The only wrong way to do it is not to do it at all, incorrectly thinking that project sustainability is something that you can put off until later.</p>

<hr>
This is a short, but to the point, piece i wrote, describing my dream of the 
Emulation Scene.
<hr>
<center><b><span size="+1">The Emulation Dream</span></b></center>
<hr>
	Heed these words, for this is the truth I speak and it lies in my heart.
<p>
	I haven't elsewhere to turn, but this page of my thoughts that, 
even though through time I may be forgotten, my words will live on.<br>
</p><p>
	It isn't about stealing software because you don't have the ability
of getting it through legal means.<br>
</p><p>
	Nor about creating the best emulator the quickest and charging the
most money for it.<br>
</p><p>
	Neither is it to be defined as an 'underground scene' where people
turn to for free handouts.<br>
</p><p>
	I hear the evil echos...of 'rom begging'... complaining...<br>
</p><p>
	But I have an epiphany...The Emulation Dream.<br>
</p><p>	
	This is my dream, hear me out and you shall enter my world...<br>
</p><p>
	I see a world where people, young and old alike, relive days gone
by when video games first entered my world.<br>
</p><p>
       Where people work together to help each other realize this dream, the
dream I have and others share, where the emulation world and its Nostalgic 
value exsists for one reason:<br>
</p><p>
	'Fun'.<br>
</p><p>
	In the days we are in, where Technology is advanced, and we have games
that 5 years ago would have required more money than anyone could afford, 
and yet we ask ourselves, have we REALLY advanced?<br>
</p><p>
	Mine is a world where we all strive to bring back those days, not a 
world where you exploit this dream of mine, of ours, to make money, not a world
where you seek free handouts like a welfare line, nor a pirate's haven, nor a 
hacker's shelter.<br>
</p><p>
	This is the Emulation Dream. It's not about 'releasing the most roms'
and it is not about 'making the best emulator the fastest and making money off
of it'. It is about that one single solitary thing that many modern games
lack.<br>
</p><p>
	'Fun'.<br>
</p><p>
	And for all of the emulation 'scene' not to beg for these game images
that most of us treasure for its wonderous gaming value would be a new day and
age in the world of emulation.<br>
</p><p>
	Maybe some of us shall move on, maybe life will change, but this world,
this dream of mine will not expire with me.<br>
</p><p>
	Or With us.<br>
</p><p>
	It will go on, it will continue to grow, this isn't my world anymore,
this is OUR world.<br>
</p><p>
	And may it always remain as such.<br>
</p><p> 
	Emulation Forever.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The Korean Stockholders’ Alliance is located in Yeouido, Seoul’s financial and political district, on the fifth floor of an officetel building mostly occupied by financial companies. Jung Eui-jung, the 62-year-old head of the Alliance and the sole resident of its office, points out the window to a large, bright-yellow bus parked outside on Eunhaengro (“bank street”), so named because it is home to South Korea’s two main state banks. The Alliance is an advocacy group that represents retail investors, with around 41,000 members. Its current mission statement is displayed in block letters on the side of the bus: “I hate short selling!”</p>



<p>Jung unveiled the bus at the end of January, not long after retail investors in the U.S. gathered on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets to drive up the share price of the video game retailer GameStop by 1,700% in a meme-fueled challenge to hedge funds who had shorted — in other words, bet against — the company’s stock. Helmed by a single driver, the Stockholders’ Alliance bus shuttles between Gwanghwamun, a public plaza often used for protests, and Yeouido, passing the stock exchange, financial regulators, and the National Assembly, in the hopes of igniting a similar movement in Korea.</p>



<p>Retail traders like Jung say that short selling is an exclusionary method of profiteering used by hedge funds to drive down stock prices and run roughshod over the little guys. That’s why the “David vs. Goliath” narrative surrounding GameStop has been so enthusiastically received by small investors in South Korea, who are known locally as “ants” — a nickname that captures their underdog identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not a lot of people really knew what short selling was,” said Jung, who founded the Alliance in 2019. “But the GameStop incident provided the spark of curiosity and awakened the public to the problem.”</p>



<p>As the story made local headlines, it stirred talk of a Korean copycat movement online. On Naver Cafe, the South Korean equivalent of Reddit, Jung later named the Alliance’s anti-short-selling campaign “kstreetbets.” The forum is where most of the group’s organizing — planning protests, petitioning regulators, and writing letters to lawmakers — is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As South Korea undergoes a <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/979164.html">retail trading boom</a> during the pandemic that has sent the country’s benchmark KOSPI index to record highs, this sort of activism has turned ants into a symbol of “<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/982101.html">economic democratization</a>” and an unlikely political force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressure from retail traders like Jung pushed the government to extend a temporary ban on short selling, which was initially imposed in March of 2020. Now, with the current ban set to expire in May, Jung is campaigning for an additional <a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/2021/02/02/L67EV46KXBGGDEWOIAGAPSI2EU/">year-long extension</a>, if not an outright abolition of the practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>South Koreans have historically tended to steer clear of stocks, preferring to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/04/03/2020040302464.html%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259A%2525B0%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%25259D%2525BC%2525EC%252597%252590%2525EC%252584%25259C%252520%2525EA%2525B0%252580%2525EA%2525B5%2525AC%2525EB%25258B%2525B9%252520%2525EB%2525B6%252580%2525EB%25258F%252599%2525EC%252582%2525B0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EC%252582%2525B0,%2525EC%25258B%2525AC%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%25258F%252584%252520%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%2525B9%2525A0%2525EC%2525A7%252580%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">invest in real estate</a>. Recently, however, government curbs on property investments, stagnant wages, low interest rates, and high property prices have left people searching for a quicker buck. Jung estimated that the number of active ants has increased from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html">6 million to 10 million</a> over the past year alone.</p>



<p>Much of that increase has been among <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">millennials</a> — known as the “2030 generation” — who are <a href="http://economy.chosun.com/client/news/view.php?boardName=C03&amp;page=3&amp;t_num=13609701">approaching stocks</a> with a generational pessimism, embodied in <a href="https://imnews.imbc.com/news/2021/society/article/6076397_34873.html">terms like <em>yeoung-ggeul</em></a><em> </em>(a Korean portmanteau that translates to “scraping together your soul to invest”) and <em>bittu</em> (taking out debt to invest). <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">Shunning conventional long-term investment vehicles</a> like index trackers or exchange-traded funds, they <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html%2523:~:text=%2525EA%2525B1%2525B0%2525EB%25259E%252598%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25259D%252580%25252065.8%252525%2525EB%2525A1%25259C,%2525EB%2525B0%2525A9%2525EC%25258B%25259D%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B0%2525B8%2525EC%252597%2525AC%2525ED%252595%252598%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">have</a> preferred to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">buy and sell their stocks directly</a>, seeking mid-to-high returns. For many, according to one <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">poll</a>, stocks <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/1Z5HQ1TAEZ">represent</a> a ticket to home ownership.</p>

<p>Technology has also lowered the barrier to entry since Jung began investing in stocks as a salaryman bank worker in the mid-1990s. The new wave of retail investors tends to gravitate toward easy-to-use <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/a-retail-trading-army-has-been-roiling-korean-stocks-for-months">brokerage apps</a> with low commissions and to finding trading strategies and tips online. “Back in the day, you’d study by reading books about stocks, but now the overwhelming trend is watching YouTube videos, especially for the 2030 generation,” Jung said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That has brought its own perils. YouTube can be a valuable resource for the wise, but a minefield of fraudulent advice for the gullible. In legally ambiguous KakaoTalk or Telegram group chats known as “<a href="http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/48901.html">leading rooms</a>,” anonymous stock tipsters (“leaders”) sweet-talk credulous ants with promises of windfall profits before bilking them. Some leaders <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2021/01/39881/">turn out to be running pump-and-dump schemes</a>. Or “they’ll pull tricks like pretending to be offering a free service before directing you to a room with a subscription fee,” said Jung, who noted that he has reported some of the chat rooms to financial regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jung is also concerned by what financial experts have <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/03/06/2017030603181.html">cautioned</a> is the tendency of ants to go after risky, short-term bets. “South Korea might have one of the highest literacy rates in the world, but our level of financial literacy is very poor,” said Jung. “Ants do a lot of quick-hit trading — selling when prices rise a little but also when prices drop just slightly.” One popular <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23875703">rule of thumb</a> for young ants has been “hitting five,” or cashing out whenever you reach a 5% return or make $45 (50,000 won) in profit. Many have also turned to margin trading, essentially borrowing money to buy stocks, which has recently become <a href="https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0102_202101181804220081">more popular</a> than ever. With the Korean stock market <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228425122_Why_are_Korean_markets_so_volatile">notoriously volatile</a>, investors can easily end up losing more than they put in.</p>



<p>But when the ants work together, they can move markets. Last March, foreign and institutional investors, worried about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sold off a combined $46 billion (50 trillion won) of the benchmark KOSPI, pushing the market down to a dismal 1,457.64 points. <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/977810.html">Ants countered</a>, buying $43.58 billion (47.4 trillion won), propelling the KOSPI index over the 3,000 mark for the first time in history, in January of this year. The feat has been named the <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/976027.html">Donghak Ant Movement</a>, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Donghak Peasant Revolution, an 1894 uprising of farmers against corrupt government officials and economic destabilization at the hands of foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players. Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The stock market index has historically fallen before rebounding in times of crisis, and it seems like retail investors anticipated this scenario this time,” said Kim So-young, a finance professor at Seoul National University. “Once it became apparent that a lot of them were holding the line, more piled on, causing the surge.”</p>



<p>The ants’ ability to collectively flex their power has given them <a href="https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=5090525">undeniable political leverage</a>. In late 2020, the Alliance <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/11/03/2020110302008.html">successfully rallied against a government proposal</a> to expand capital gains taxes on stock investments for the top 5% of retail investors. Since December 2020, over 200,000 people have signed a <a href="https://www1.president.go.kr/petitions/595214">presidential petition</a> calling for the abolition of short selling, meeting the requirement for an official response from the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proponents of short selling argue that it functions as a kind of safety valve for the stock market. By allowing investors to bet in both directions, the practice skims the fat off overvalued stocks and keeps the market efficient. But “the problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players,” said Jung. “Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p>



<p>Short selling comprises only about 4% of total trades in South Korea, compared to around 40% in other major markets, but the point, according to Jung, is the inequality. “The dynamic is always one side disproportionately profiting, while retail investors are losing,” said Jung. “That’s what needs to change.”</p>



<p>Shorting a stock requires first borrowing the shares, which you then later buy back at a lower price to make a profit. Individual investors <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210113116200502%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EB%2525B3%2525B8%2525EC%25258B%25259C%2525EC%25259E%2525A5%2525EB%2525B2%252595%252520180%2525EC%2525A1%2525B0%2525EB%25258A%252594,%2525EB%2525B6%252588%2525EB%2525B2%252595%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B7%2525A8%2525EA%2525B8%252589%2525EB%252590%252598%2525EB%25258A%252594%252520%2525EA%2525B2%252583%2525EC%25259D%2525B4%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">face high collateral rates and fees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/ko-kr/money/markets/%2525EA%2525B3%2525B5%2525EB%2525A7%2525A4%2525EB%25258F%252584%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25258B%2525AC-%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525ED%252585%25258C%2525EC%25259D%2525BC%2525ED%252592%252580%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EB%2525B0%252580/ar-BB1cDqVv">limited selections</a> of shares, and a repayment period capped at 60 days. Foreign investors and institutions, on the other hand, have no fixed repayment deadline — although lenders can technically recall their shares at any time. Moreover, capital gains from short selling are untaxed. Consequently, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/view/2019/12/1054426/">just 1%</a> of short sellers in South Korea are small investors.</p>



<p>Retail investors, particularly those trading on margins, are also uniquely vulnerable to market volatility, which short selling can amplify — particularly in small stocks that are already sensitive to large movements. “There is definitely an aspect of short selling that stokes volatility,” said Kim So-young, the finance professor. “For stock that might not fall as dramatically if it weren’t being shorted, a short sell can exacerbate the decline.”</p>



<p>This has heightened the sense among ants that big institutional and foreign investors can use short selling to siphon money from retail traders. A <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/17/2021011700419.html">recently published study</a> by researchers at Hanyang University found that short sellers in Korea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/short-sellers-under-siege-everywhere-have-it-really-bad-in-korea">averaged about $2 million in daily profits</a> from 2016 to 2019, while investors who traded on margin lost an average of $900,000 per day. “The rule here is that the money flows out from the wallets of individual investors to short sellers,” Jung said. “It’s a staggering gap.”</p>



<p>Although short selling alone is unlikely to cause the index to plummet, some analysts worry that the market is approaching a bubble and that <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210203165200004">overleveraged new ants</a> could soon find themselves in trouble.</p>



<p>Jung said that authorities should use this moment to put in place protections and education for retail investors so that they can better handle volatility. He is also studying the fallout from the r/WallStreetBets incident. Many retail investors lost out as GameStop shares slumped again after the rush was over.</p>

                        <p><span>31-01-2021</span></p><h2>Using LiveView and GenServers to track BTC price</h2>

                        <p>My assumption was that price of Bitcoin varies from one cryptocurrecy exchange to another and that I could earn just by buying and selling BTC on different platforms. In order to check that I could just get prices from last few days from few exchanges and use Excel to do the comparison or I could use this idea to improve my knowledge on <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a>. As you have already guessed I picked latter option.</p>

                        <p><img src="https://cmdarek.com/images/ebisu.svg"></p>

                        <p>Our solution consist of two application: ebisu and ebisu_web. First one is responsible for periodically check BTC price in exchanges, saving this data in db and notifying ebisu_web about new pices. Ebisu_web is simple web application that shows BTC price from few exchanges in real time. To not add unnecessary complexity I'm going to describe solution only for <a href="https://bitbay.net/">BitBay exchange</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cmdarek.com/images/ebisu.gif"></p>

                        <h3>Main components</h3>
                        <p>To fetch data from exchanges we use <a href="https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison">HTTPoison</a> which is simple yet powerfull HTTP client. Ebisu.Utils.Http is wrapper around this library. It is done that way to reuse it in multiple places and to mock it in tests. This component should be moved to separate application where we could test it with real api and in tests for ebisu app we should use mocks.</p>                       
                        <pre>                        <code>
defmodule Ebisu.Utils.Http do
  @timeout 5000
  @callback get(String.t()) :: term() | no_return() | {:error, term()}

  def get(url) do
    case HTTPoison.get(url, [{"content-type", "application/json"}], recv_timeout: @timeout) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body, status_code: 200}} -&gt;
        Jason.decode!(body)

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} -&gt;
        {:error, body}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} -&gt;
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end

  def new do
    Application.get_env(:ebisu, :http_client)
  end
end
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>To simplify code we have yet another layer of abstraction for http client. For each exchange we have specific http client. In <a href="https://bitbay.net/">BitBay</a> example we are going to fetch BTC price in PLN which we then convert to USD.</p>
                        <pre>                        <code>
defmodule Ebisu.Bitbay.Clients.Http do
  alias Ebisu.Utils.Http

  def get_ticker do
    Http.new().get("https://bitbay.net/API/Public/BTCPLN/ticker.json")
  end

  def get_rate do
    rate = Http.new().get("http://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/rates/a/usd/?format=json")

    rate
    |&gt; Map.get("rates")
    |&gt; Enum.at(0)
    |&gt; Map.get("mid")
  end
end
                        </code> 
                        </pre>

                        <p>In heart of our application is exchange module which main responsibility is to get last price of BTC, converte it to USD and save it to db. Data is going to be stored in PostgreSQL using Ecto. For this to work we also have to define schema and migration.</p>
                        <pre>                        <code>

<![CDATA[How to Make a Contract Legal]]>

March 3, 2021 | https://www.lawdistrict.com/articles/how-to-make-a-contract-legal | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lawdistrict.com/articles/how-to-make-a-contract-legal">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
          <p>A <strong><a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/">legal contract</a></strong> is an enforceable set of promises made between two or more parties. Both written and oral contracts can be legally valid, as long as all of the elements required to form a valid contract are satisfied.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-legal-contracts">Types of Legal Contracts</h2>
<p>There are <strong>two types of legal contracts</strong>: bilateral contracts and unilateral contracts.</p>
<p>The majority of contracts are bilateral. In a <strong>bilateral contract</strong>, <strong>each party makes a promise to the other party</strong>. A contract to purchase goods is a classic example of a bilateral contract. The seller agrees to deliver the goods to the buyer, and the buyer agrees to pay the buyer for the goods once they are received.</p>
<p>In a <strong>unilateral contract</strong>, <strong>one party makes a promise</strong> to be carried out on a future date in exchange for a present action <strong>by the other party</strong>. A good example of this type of contract is a liability Insurance policy: you perform a present action by paying your monthly premium in exchange for the insurance company's promise to pay your claims in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-contract-legal">What Makes a Contract Legal</h2>
<p>Contract law is governed by both the <strong>common law and statutory law</strong>. The <a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/legal-dictionary/common-law">common law</a> is created through decisions made by judges, whereas statutory law is written by state and federal legislative bodies, such as Congress. </p>
<p>Generally, contracts do not have to be committed to writing to be enforceable. However, each state has its own <strong>“<a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/legal-dictionary/statute-of-fraud">Statute of Frauds</a>”</strong>, which requires certain types of contracts to be written to be legally valid. However, all legally binding contracts must involve the exchange of something of value, such as goods, services, or money.</p>
<p>Legal contracts must also <strong>clearly and accurately describe the agreement between the parties.</strong> Errors, ambiguous or omitted terms, and mistakes can all render a contract invalid. For a contract to be as clear as possible, it should specify all the terms of the contract, accounting for any possible contingencies that may occur, when and how the contract will terminate, and any <a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/non-disclosure-agreement/">Non-Disclosure Agreement</a> the parties want to include in the contract.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-a-contract-legally-enforceable">Elements of a Contract: Legally Enforceable</h2>
<p>Every legally enforceable contract must satisfy four basic elements: Offer, Acceptance, Consideration, and Legality. Each of these elements must exist to make a contract legally valid.</p>
<ul><li>An <strong>offer</strong> occurs when one party makes a promise to do something or refrain from doing something.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> occurs when the offer is accepted unambiguously by the other party. Acceptance can be given through words, actions, or performance of the promise required by the contract.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration</strong> means that the accepting party promised something of value in exchange for the offered action or nonaction. Consideration law is what distinguishes a contract from a gift. </li>
<li>The <strong>legality</strong> element requires that the contract serve a legal purpose. A contract cannot be used to enforce illegal and/or criminal activities. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-a-contract-be-signed">How Can a Contract Be Signed?</h2>
<p>For a written contract agreement to be valid, it must be signed by both parties. The signatures are legally recognized as each party’s agreement to the terms of the contract and to be bound by the obligations of the contract. </p>
<p>Contracts can generally be <strong>signed either by hand or electronically</strong>. Until recently, “wet ink” physical signatures were the only type of legally-accepted signature. However, with the increase in international business and the improvements in modern technology, <strong>digital signatures are now a common and legally-recognized practice</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="termination-of-a-contract">Termination of a Contract</h2>
<p>Most written contracts will <strong>include terms that explain when the contract will terminate</strong>. Contracts generally terminate on a certain date, upon the performance of the duties of the contract, or at the request of either party.</p>
<p>Many written contracts will also include terms regarding <strong>how parties can terminate the contract</strong> if the one party fails to perform their duties under the contract. This failure to fulfill contract obligations is called a “breach of contract”, or just a “breach”. If the contract does not contain terms allowing for the termination of a contract upon a breach, then the non-breaching party can pursue compensation from the breaching party through the court system. </p>
<p>In court, there are <strong>several remedies for a breach of contract</strong>. Most commonly, the non-breaching party can sue for damages, requesting that the breaching party compensate for the loss suffered because of the breach. However, in certain situations, a judge may order that the breaching party perform the obligation required by the contract (this is called “specific performance”) or terminate the contract.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-contract-invalid">What Makes a Contract Invalid?</h2>
<p>There are a variety of reasons why a contract can be considered invalid. Generally, a contract that was made with someone who did not <strong>have contractual capacity is not considered a binding contract</strong>, nor is a contract that was not mutually assented to.</p>
<p>People who are under the legal age of consent, who are mentally disabled or mentally ill, or who are intoxicated are not considered to have the mental capacity to form a contract. This means that any <strong>contract that is made with someone without contractual capacity is voidable by that party</strong>. The party who lacked capacity can choose to honor the contract or they can render it invalid.</p>
<p>Additionally, for a contract <strong>to be valid, all parties must have agreed to the terms of their own free will</strong>. This concept is called “mutual assent”. If one party induced the other party to agree to the contract through <strong>fraud, force, threats of violence, or other undue influence</strong>, the agreement is a <strong>voidable contract</strong>. Contracts may also lack mutual assent if both parties had the same mistaken belief about a fact at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p>Finally, a contract may be invalidated if <strong>one party fails to perform its duties.</strong> For example, in a contract for the sale of goods, if the seller never delivers the goods, the buyer will not have to pay. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><strong>In short:</strong> Microsoft Teams iOS client login screen can be bypassed after organization mandated login (refresh token) expiration has expired by dismissing the login view and tapping on the enabled user-interface elements. This behavior can be repeated an unlimited amount of times to browse section of the app and view protected data meant for a successfully authenticated user.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expiration example: <em>Organization mandates re-authentication period of 18 hours. The user is no longer authenticated 19 hours after initial login.</em></li>
  <li>Cached data such as notification, teams, and chat are available.</li>
  <li>New Teams voice calls can be successfully joined with two way voice communication.</li>
  <li>The only thing needed for this is quick fingers.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7rak6WZwSI&amp;feature=youtu.be"><img src="http://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/team_poc_2_sanitised.gif" alt="MS Teams iOS vulnerability proof of concept 2"></a></p>

<p><em>Click above image for video version of PoC screen recording.</em></p>

<p>This behavior can be viewed in the iOS Microsoft Teams app on at least version 2.3.1 (tested working on 03MAR21). I have not tested this on the equivalent Android Teams app. Steps to access user data after your login expires are below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Login to MS Teams account under an organization with a relogin (refresh token) expiration time of N. (Ex: Max lifetime of refresh token of 18 hours) MS Teams may be set to use a authentication method similar to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2">OAuth 2.0</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait N hrs for the refresh token to expire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open Teams iOS app. iOS client app will popup webview loading a login page at <em>https://login.microsoftonline.com/XXX/oauth2/v2.0/<strong>authorize</strong></em>.
&nbsp; - Before the login webview popup, the iOS client will find that the refresh_token is expired by a response from a request to <em>https://login.microsoftoline.com/XXX/oauth2/v2.0/<strong>token</strong></em>.
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> for details on the <em><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2#grant-type-authorization-code">Authorization Code</a></em> grant type login flow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>“Cancel”</strong> button in upper-left of the popup webview containing login page. The popup webview will dismiss by sliding down off the screen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Full interaction and information viewing is possible in the iOS client app for a brief period. Examples of tested data access:
&nbsp; - Bottom tab bar can be clicked to view different Teams data such as notifcations, chats, calendar.
&nbsp; - Pull to refresh on notifications view will intiate a refresh and load new data
&nbsp; - Clicking “join” meeting on calendar view will successfully join a team meeting and audio. (connection to <em>api.flightproxy.teams.microsoft.com</em> made) Creation of the meeting is logged and can be seen in the “chat” view of an event showing who entered the meeting.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/teams_call_history_blur.png" alt="MS Teams call chat history"></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>iOS client app may display a dialog indicating auth failure and an option to sign out. Click <strong>“cancel”</strong>. iOS client app will popup the login webview again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to step 4. Repeated user privileged data access is possible by cancelling the popup login webview and tapping on parts of the graphical user interface during the few seconds before the login alert and webview pop up again.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This login bypass and information disclosure vulnerability was submitted to Microsoft and assigned case #63474. Screen recordings demonstrating bypass of the login screen and ability to successfully join a call were shared as well. 
A month later, Microsoft replied that this “behavior is considered to be by design”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We determined that this behavior is considered to be by design because after the tokens expire, the device still has cached data locally which is accessible to the Teams client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caching data locally to alleviate the need to redownload user Teams data is a normal design philosophy. However, the graphical user interface should not be designed to allow free access to cached data once the user access to the data is known to be expired/invalid. The separate data storage and data presentation functionalities of the Microsoft Teams iOS client application should be designed to mask or hide the cached data from view until the user has successfully reauthenticated.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s response also suggests that being able to join, speak, and hear Teams calls when not authenticated is expected behavior.</p>

<p><img src="http://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/teams_separation_clipart_diagram.jpg" alt="MS Teams Backend/Frontend role separation"></p>

<p>A simple and effective solution would hide visibility of the main Teams user interface when the user authentication has expired. Once the user has successfully reauthenticated, enable interaction and make the main GUI containing cached user data visible again. The Teams call infrastructure should also be patched to check if the authentication has expired before allowing a client to join a call.</p>

<p>If this is apparently intended functionality - maybe a helpful feature to peek at messages and join Teams calls when the user’s authentication is not verified - people should know more about the functionality of <strong>“Quick Fingers”</strong> when the user “forgets” their password.</p>

<p>01FEB21 - Reported bug to <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) Researcher Portal</a></p>

<p>02MAR21 - MSRC informs me that login bypass and information disclosure described is unavoidable “by design”.</p>

Why does the number of YAML files have an impact on the satisfaction level with the GitOps approach? To explain this, I came up with the following thought-experiment.<br></p><p>You’re tasked with building a factory lane. The inputs are pre-processed pieces of steel. You need to build an assembly line that takes those pieces and presses them to different screws. Those screws will go into extremely sensible medical equipment. If this equipment fails, this has severe implications. You need to have end-to-end auditability of what screw came from what piece of steel.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><span id="hs-cta-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><img id="hs-cta-img-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e.png" alt="Webinar: GitOps from the Trenches"></a></span></span></p><p>‍<br>So far, so good. Not a simple exercise but doable if you can control the input, right? If you get the exact same piece of metal in the exact same quality every time, it’s straightforward to ensure that the output is consistent.<br></p><p>Let’s assume the assembly line is perfect and is never the cause of failure. This assumption leaves the input as the only reason a screw can fail. Let’s say we only have one screw. This case can be characterized with the following graphic:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d784ef0c349adb1e5b5_screw-from-1-supplier.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If the probability that the steel delivered by &lt;it&gt;supplier 1&lt;it&gt; works by 90%, the system’s (the medical equipment) overall probability to function as expected equals the probability of &lt;it&gt;screw 1&lt;it&gt; to work. This takes us to the following likelihood to fail:<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails) = 1- P(steel supplier 1 fails)<br></blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong> In the single supplier example, the failure probability equals 10%.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, life is more complicated. You now have three steel suppliers. Again, for sake of simplicity, we assume that steel from each supplier is used for exactly one screw in the machine. And our machine now consists of three screws that can each fail. In a graphical representation, it looks something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d9aec665260b33367f8_screws-from-supplier-1-2-3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To keep the formula easy, we will assume the steel from all three suppliers works with the exact same probability of 90%.<br></p><blockquote>P1=0.9, P2=0.9, and P3=0.9<br></blockquote><p>The combined probability of the medical equipment to function as expected can be calculated by multiplying all probabilities.<br></p><p>We can simplify:</p><blockquote>P(system works) = P1*P2*P3 to P(system works)=P^n<br></blockquote><p>Which means the likelihood of the system not to work equals:<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails)=1-p^n<br></blockquote><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Putting in the actual numbers this leaves us with 27.1% likelihood that this system fails at some point.<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails) = 1-0.9^3 = 0.271 or 27,1%<br></blockquote><p>Reality is even more screwed (haha). You will have several screws made from steel from different suppliers. We will refrain from complicating this further. You get the idea now.<br></p><p>&lt;it&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;it&gt; With an increasing number of suppliers (with their own unique likelihood of supplying failing pieces), your overall probability of failure rises. Remember, the likelihood of failure with a single supplier and screw was 10%. Where with three suppliers of three screws, the likelihood of failure equals 27.1%.<br></p><p>It also tells us that if you start simple, you can go for quite some time without experiencing any failures; You can actually statistically calculate how long you can go on before you experience the first failure.<br></p><p>In general, with a growing number of processes, failure will hit. Once failure hits, it also gets increasingly hard to ensure your audit trail. You’ll soon find yourself trying to understand what piece of steel - by which supplier - was used to produce the specific screw that then failed.<br></p><h2>So what?<br></h2><p>Why am I telling you this nonsense about screws, you ask?<br></p><p>Because it’s a good way to understand the fundamental problem with GitOps. The problem is not the toolchain (although mostly immature at the moment), but in particular, the nature of its input. Let’s translate the above example into our software world!<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Your assembly line is your GitOps toolchain and workflow.&nbsp;</li><li>Your suppliers are individual developers.&nbsp;</li><li>Steel is now a set of configuration files written in YAML</li><li>Your screws are microservices.</li><li>The machine you’re building is an application.<br></li></ul><p>If we have one service from one supplier, the world looks like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7dc23cb13acb7b1e9b65_microservice-from-one-developer.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, let’s add microservices from different developers:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7de3741d50926b298565_microservices-developer-1-2-3-yamls.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Your likelihood of failure rises with the same formula. It depends on the number of YAML files from individual developers that configure an individual microservice and the number of suppliers.<br></p><p>You will likely go without any trouble for some time and YAML volume. But the time will come where it will fail. And when it fails, GitOps becomes a nightmare to audit where the system failed: Finding what introduced the problem and why becomes a real challenge.<br></p><p>Using a version control system to browse and try to trace an error in <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/tame-your-zoo-of-scripts">unstructured scripts</a> is a horrible endeavor (and gets more horrible with the total number of YAML files rising.)<br></p><p>Let’s change our original screws graphic. Also, we can swap the Y-axis with the probability of <strong>not</strong> experiencing failure of the system:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7df94572daa055338527_probability-of-working-system-vs-number-of-yaml-files.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This matches well with how the Director of Platform of a huge global delivery company has recently described his experience with the GitOps approach:<br></p><blockquote>“GitOps is like magic if it works, and like magic if it doesn’t.”<br></blockquote><p>In short, as you do not control the quality and consistency of the input, and the system is hard to audit, throwing an assembly line (or automation framework) on top is a terrible idea. It will not fail immediately, but it will eventually. If it does, it’s bad. Things get worse with time and the number of services in the system.</p><h2>So what to do now?</h2><p>You have exactly one way of solving this problem: You focus on the input.<br></p><p>Your problem lies with the unstructured nature of the “YAML” format. If you can solve this, you can use the GitOps approach (or anything else), and it will work. But if you decide not to eradicate the root cause, you’ll run into GitOps’ scalability and auditability problems.<br></p><p>Ádám Sándor from Container Solutions actually wrote a <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/gitops-limitations">great piece</a> on this. So how do you fix the input? How is configuration as code possible (with all its advantages), while load balancing the down-sides (the unstructured format and the lack of control.)?<br></p><p>The key is to remove or minimize the human error when creating those YAML files, which is the main cause of an increased probability of failure. The fewer “suppliers” you have, the less likelihood of failure you’ll have.<br></p><p>So how do you actually do that? You cannot erase it entirely, because it’s unlikely to believe that a.) a single set of manifests can rule them all and b.) the Ops team can write all manifests themselves. The solution is to work with “baseline configurations'' and let developers apply changes to those baseline configurations in a standardized way. Developers can create different baseline configuration profiles.<br></p><p>In those profiles, they set specific standards such as “the default CPU allocation on a workload always equals 0.25.”&nbsp; Developers can make changes against these default templates via a centralized UI or CLI. At deployment time, a tool (an <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform">Internal Developer Platform</a>, for instance) can apply the changes to the baseline configurations and create the manifests.<br></p><p>As you can see, we are now “creating” new manifests from a set of clearly auditable rules for every single deployment. This is an immutable record of the state of application configurations at deployment time. Whether you use GitOps to then execute those configurations or any other method doesn’t really matter. As we are now tightly controlling the input, the assembly line isn’t as important.<br></p><p>This strategy provides the Ops team with more control over the YAML files and prevents any “surprise” changes by developers while still giving them the needed freedom to configure their applications.<br></p><p>In other words, developers aren’t restricted as they can still apply all changes if necessary while you eradicate input variability. But the nature of creating one set of new manifests per deployment makes it traceable, auditable, and simple to roll back to the previous version.<br></p><h2>Do you have a different experience?&nbsp;</h2><p>Look at our little formula. If you are a small team, or you work with a limited amount of services, your likelihood of regularly hitting problems is low, maybe very low.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><span id="hs-cta-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><img id="hs-cta-img-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e.png" alt="Webinar: GitOps from the Trenches"></a></span></span></p><p>If this makes it feasible for you, I’m not saying you should change anything. But if you are running 5+ apps with 10+ services, each in production, you should seriously consider whether getting into GitOps is a good idea.<br></p><p>&lt;it&gt;From my experience: it isn’t.&lt;it&gt;<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Today I am going to discuss quite a new idea for Python users, an idea of making tests a valuable part of your application.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into it.</p>


      <h2 id="current-status">
        
        <a href="#current-status">Current status</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Right now the status-quo for source code/tests dualism is that you ship source code to your library users and most often do not include your tests in any manner.</p>

<p>Sometimes people also attach the <code>tests/</code> folder to a release, so they are just laying around just in case. Most of the time they are useless to the end-user.</p>

<p>And what is the most important part of it all is that our users are often find themselves in a situation when they have to reimplement some tests for library-specific things.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example: you have a Django view for authorized users only.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.decorators</span> <span>import</span> <span>login_required</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>,</span> <span>HttpResponse</span>

<span>@</span><span>login_required</span>
<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HttpRespose</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, in our tests we would have to write at least two tests:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For the successful auth case and our business logic</li>
  <li>For the failed auth case</li>
</ol>

<p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could just skip the second one and rely on some existing test-logic that we can re-use from the library itself?</p>

<p>Imagine an API like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># tests/test_views/test_my_view.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>myapp.views</span> <span>import</span> <span>my_view</span>

<span>def</span> <span>test_authed_successfully</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Test case for our own logic."""</span>

<span># Not authed case:
</span><span>my_view</span><span>.</span><span>test_not_authed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then - boom - we have our second use-case tested with just a single line of code!</p>

<p>And it goes further than this. For example, in Django you can stack function <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/decorators/">decorators</a> to do multiple things. Imagine this situation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>django.views.decorators.cache</span> <span>import</span> <span>never_cache</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.decorators</span> <span>import</span> <span>login_required</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.views.decorators.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>require_http_methods</span>

<span>@</span><span>require_http_methods</span><span>([</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>
<span>@</span><span>login_required</span>
<span>@</span><span>never_cache</span>
<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HttpRespose</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the API might be a little more magical to include a test for all the possible cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># tests/test_views/test_my_view.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>myapp.views</span> <span>import</span> <span>my_view</span>

<span>my_view</span><span>.</span><span>run_tests</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it can potentially execute:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tests for http methods that are not allowed</li>
  <li>Tests for http methods that are allowed</li>
  <li>Test that <code>Cache-Control</code> header is there and has a correct value</li>
  <li>Test that unauthorized users are not allowed</li>
  <li>And possibly others!</li>
</ol>

<p>All you have to do is testing your green path with a possibility to customize some particular generated test cases if you have some specifics, like returning a custom http code for unauthorized users.</p>

<p>The bad part of this chapter is that the discussed API does not exist. And probably won’t ever exist in Django.</p>

<p>But, there are other less-known projects (but ones that I help to maintain) that already have these features. Let’s see what you can do with them!</p>


    
      <h2 id="deal">
        
        <a href="#deal">deal</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/life4/deal"><code>deal</code></a> is a library for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design-by-Contract</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, it allows decorating your functions and classes with some extra checks that are not representable by types (at least in Python-land).</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a function to divide two positive integers (which are just <code>int</code> in Python):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>b</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>raises</span><span>(</span><span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>)</span>  <span># this function can raise if `b=0`, it is ok
</span><span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has all the contract information in the function’s definition:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>@deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)</code> checks that passed arguments are positive</li>
  <li><code>@deal.raises(ZeroDivisionError)</code> allows this function to explicitly raise <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> without breaking the contract, by default functions cannot raise any exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: type annotations like in <code>(a: int, b: int) -&gt; float</code> are not enforced, you should use <code>mypy</code> to catch typing errors.</p>

<p>Usage (remember, it is still just a function!):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok
</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok, runtime ZeroDivisionError
</span>
<span>div</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span># not ok
# deal.PreContractError: expected a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0 (where a=-1, b=1)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, the simple use-case is clear. Now, let’s put a bug in this function on purpose:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>b</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>raises</span><span>(</span><span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>)</span>  <span># this function can raise if `b=0`, it is ok
</span><span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>50</span><span>:</span>  <span># Custom, in real life this would be a bug in our logic:
</span>        <span>raise</span> <span>Exception</span><span>(</span><span>'Oh no! Bug happened!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Luckily, <code>deal</code> follows the core idea of this article and ships tests with itself. To run them all we need to do is write just a single test case:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>from</span> <span>my_lib</span> <span>import</span> <span>div</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>cases</span><span>(</span><span>div</span><span>)</span>  <span># That's all we have to do to test deal-based functions!
</span><span>def</span> <span>test_div</span><span>(</span><span>case</span><span>:</span> <span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>TestCase</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what the output would be like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>» pytest test_deal.py
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 1 item

test_deal.py F                                                            [100%]

    def div(a: int, b: int) -&gt; float:
        if a &gt; 50:
&gt;           raise Exception('Oh no! Bug happened!')
E           Exception: Oh no! Bug happened!

============================== 1 failed in 0.35s ===============================
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see our tests did find the bug! But how?</p>

<p>There are a lot of questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where did the data for the test come from?
It comes from another awesome library called <a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis"><code>hypothesis</code></a>. It smartly generates lots of different test data according to some specific rules we define.</p>

    <p>In our case, we have two rules. First rule generate two <code>int</code> arguments as defined in <code>def div(a: int, b: int)</code>. The second rule is that these integers must be <code>&gt;= 0</code> as defined in <code>@deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)</code>.</p>

    <p>We can control how many examples would be generated and do other small tweaks.
More about it is in the <a href="https://deal.readthedocs.io/basic/tests.html">docs</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> didn’t break the test while raw <code>Exception</code> did?
Because that’s how contracts work: you clearly define all possible cases. If something strange happens - the contract is violated. In our example, <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> is a part of the contract via <code>deal.raises</code> decorator. So, we know that it can (and will) happen. That’s why we don’t treat it as a test failure, while raw <code>Exception</code> is not a part of our contract and we treat it as a failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it find all bugs in my code?
That’s the most interesting question. And the answer is <strong>no</strong>. Sad, but true.
There are endless use-cases, logic, combitations, and bugs in them. And I know for sure that it is impossible to catch all bugs your app has.</p>

    <p>But, in reality, it will catch <strong>a lot</strong> of bugs. In my opinion, it is still worth it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can even go one step further and represent our contracts as <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Theorems to be proved</a>.
For example, <code>deal</code> has an ongoing research companion project - <a href="https://github.com/orsinium-labs/deal-solver"><code>deal-solver</code></a> - that can help with that. But, this is a subject for another article of its own, so let’s move on for now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns"><code>dry-python/returns</code></a> is a library with primitives that make typed functional programming in Python easier.</p>

<p>Inside we have a bunch of interfaces that our users can extend for their own primitives/objects. In the recent article about <a href="https://sobolevn.me/2020/10/higher-kinded-types-in-python">Higher Kinded Types</a> I have shown how this can be done in a type-safe way.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to show that it is not enough on its own. And most likely you will need some extra laws on how your objects should behave.</p>

<p>We call this feature “Monad laws as values”.</p>


    
      <h3 id="identity-laws">
        
        <a href="#identity-laws">Identity laws</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Let’s start from the easiest Higher Kinded Interface we have: <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/master/returns/interfaces/equable.py"><code>Equable</code></a>. It is an interface that allows type-safe equality checks. Because you can use <code>==</code> for everything in Python. But, our <code>.equals()</code> method will allow us to only check the object of the same type which has real values inside.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>returns.io</span> <span>import</span> <span>IO</span>

<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>  <span># type-checks, but pointless, always false
</span>
<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span># does not type-check at all
# error: Argument 1 has incompatible type "int";
# expected "KindN[IO[Any], Any, Any, Any]"
</span>
<span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>IO</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>other</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok, might be true or false
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how it looks like at the moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_EqualType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_EqualType'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>'Equable'</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Equable</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>:</span> <span>_EqualType</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>_EqualType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
        <span>"""Type-safe equality check for values of the same type."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s say we want to create a bad implementation for this interface (because of science):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>returns.interfaces.equable</span> <span>import</span> <span>Equable</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>Equable</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>inner_value</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_inner_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>inner_value</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>'Example'</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>  <span># it breaks how `.equals` is supposed to be used!
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is clearly wrong because it always returns <code>False</code> without actually checking the <code>inner_value</code> of an object. But, it still satisfies the interface definition: it will type-check. That’s how we can tell that just the interface is not enough. We need to test the implementation as well.</p>

<p>But, equality has known laws from math to catch cases like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reflexive law: a value must be equal to itself</li>
  <li>Symmetry law: <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code></li>
  <li>Transitivity law: if <code>a</code> equals <code>b</code> and <code>b</code> equals <code>c</code>, then <code>a</code> equals <code>c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We can create a test that will ensure that our implementation holds these laws. Or we might forget about it. Or make a mistake in our test logic.</p>

<p>That’s why it is important for library authors to think about their users and ship tests with their apps.</p>

<p>For example, we encode laws into the interface definition itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>ClassVar</span><span>,</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>from</span> <span>typing…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Django 3.2 is just around the corner and it's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2/" rel="noopener">packed with new features</a>. Django versions are usually not that exciting (it's a good thing!), but this time many features were added to the ORM, so I find it especially interesting!</p>
<p><strong>This is a list of my favorite features in Django 3.2</strong></p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Image from the Django welcome page</figcaption>

<p>A lot of great people worked on this release and none of them is me. I included links to the tickets of each new feature to show my appreciation to the people behind it.</p>
<details open="">
    <summary>Table of Contents</summary>

<hr>
<details markdown="1">
<summary>⚙ Setup local environment with the latest version of Django</summary>
<p>To setup an environment with the latest version of Django start by creating a new directory and a virtual environment:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> mkdir django32
<span>$</span> <span>cd</span> django32
<span>$</span> python3.9 -m venv venv
<span>$</span> <span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>


<p>To install the latest version of Django you can either install using <code>pip</code>, or if it hasn't been released yet, install directly from git:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> pip install git+https://github.com/django/django@3.2a1
</pre></div>


<p>Start a new project and app:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> django-admin startproject project
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py startapp store
</pre></div>


<p>Add the new app to the list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>, and configure a PostgreSQL database:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># settings.py</span>

<span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>'store'</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'default'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'ENGINE'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.db.backends.postgresql'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django32'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'USER'</span><span>:</span> <span>'postgres'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To try out some of the new features, create a <code>Customer</code> model:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># store/models.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>

<span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>joined_at</span><span>:</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>DateTimeField</span><span>()</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>1000</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, create the DB, generate and apply the migrations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> createdb django32 -O postrges
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py makemigrations
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py migrate
</pre></div>


<p>Great! Now add some random customer data:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>string</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>random</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>

<span>DAY</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>timedelta</span><span>(</span><span>days</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>bulk_create</span><span>((</span><span>Customer</span><span>(</span>

<span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>__</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>_000</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations! You now have 10K new customers, you are ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="covering-indexes"><a href="#covering-indexes">Covering Indexes</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30913" rel="noopener">Ticket #30913</a></p>
<p>Covering indexes let you store additional columns in an index. The main benefit of a covering index is that when a query only uses fields that are present in the index, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">database can use an index-only scan</a>, meaning the actual table is not accessed at all. This can make queries faster.</p>
<p>Django 3.2 added support for PostgreSQL covering indexes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Index.include and UniqueConstraint.include attributes allow creating covering indexes and covering unique constraints on PostgreSQL 11+.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If for example you are searching for names of customers that have joined during a certain period of time, you can create an index on <code>joined_at</code>, and include the field <code>name</code> in the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>indexes</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Index</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>%(app_label)s</span><span>_</span><span>%(class)s</span><span>_joined_at_ix'</span><span>,</span>
<span>                <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,),</span>
</span><span>                <span>include</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,),</span>
</span>            <span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>include</code> arguments makes this a covering index.</p>
<p>For queries that only use the fields <code>joined_at</code> and <code>name</code>, the database will be able to satisfy queries using just the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at__lt</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>.</span><span>localize</span><span>(</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2021</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>explain</span><span>()</span>
<span>... </span><span>)</span>

<span><span>Index Only Scan using store_customer_joined_at_ix on store_customer</span>
</span><span>  Index Cond: (joined_at &lt; '2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'::timestamp with time zone)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The query above finds names of customers that joined before February 2021. According to the execution plan, the database was able to satisfy the query using just the index, without even accessing the table. This is called an "index only scan".</p>
<p>Index only scans can be a bit confusing at first. As described in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">official documentation of PostgreSQL</a>, it might take some time before PostgreSQL can actually use <em>just</em> the index:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is an additional requirement for any table scan in PostgreSQL: it must verify that each retrieved row be “visible” to the query's MVCC snapshot [...]. Visibility information is not stored in index entries, only in heap entries; so at first glance it would seem that every row retrieval would require a heap access anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to check if a table page can be viewed by the current transaction is to check the table's visibility map, which is significantly smaller and faster to access than the table itself. It may take some time for PostgreSQL to update the visibility map, so until then you might see an execution plan like this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Bitmap</span> <span>Heap</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>27.07..117.02</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Recheck</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>Bitmap</span> <span>Index</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer_joined_at_ix</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>0.00..26.86</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>Index</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To check if your index can really be used for index only scans, you can speed up the process by manually issuing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" rel="noopener">vacuum analyze</a> on the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>VACUUM</span> <span>ANALYZE</span> <span>store_customer</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Executing <code>VACUUM</code> will also <a href="https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unused-index-size#index-and-table-bloat">reclaim some unused space</a> and make it available for re-use.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE 2020-03-04</em>: I originally suggested using <code>VACUUM FULL</code> instead of plain <code>VACUUM</code>. <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien_nayrat/status/1367153917239427078?s=20" rel="noopener">A commenter on twitter</a> mentioned that using <code>VACUUM</code> will be sufficient for this purpose, and will be much less intrusive and disruptive, so use that instead!</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that inclusive indexes are not free. Additional fields in the index will make the index bigger.</p>

<h2 id="provide-timezone-to-truncdate"><a href="#provide-timezone-to-truncdate">Provide Timezone to TruncDate</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31948" rel="noopener">Ticket #31948</a></p>
<p>I write a lot about <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts">mistakes in SQL</a> and timezones are usually at the top of the list. One of the most dangerous mistakes when working with timestamps is <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts#be-aware-of-timezones">truncating without explicitly specifying a timezone</a>, which can lead to incorrect and inconsistent results.</p>
<p>In Django 3.2 it becomes easier to avoid this mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new tzinfo parameter of the TruncDate and TruncTime database functions allows truncating datetimes in a specific timezone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous Django versions, the timezone was set internally according to the current timezone:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># django/db/models/functions/datetime.py</span>
<span>tzname</span> <span>=</span> <span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>get_current_timezone_name</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>USE_TZ</span> <span>else</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As of Django 3.2, you can explicitly provide a timezone to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/database-functions/#django.db.models.functions.TruncDate" rel="noopener"><code>TruncDate</code></a> functions family:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>TruncDay</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>timezone</span><span>(</span><span>'America/New_York'</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC(</span>
<span>#     'day',</span>
<span>#     "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'</span>
<span># ) AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A step in the right direction!</p>

<h2 id="building-json-objects"><a href="#building-json-objects">Building JSON Objects</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32179" rel="noopener">Ticket #32179</a></p>
<p>Building JSON objects in PostgreSQL is very handy, especially if you are working with unstructured data.</p>
<p>As of Django 3.2, the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>json_build_object</code> from PostgreSQL</a> that accepts arbitrary key-value pairs was added to the ORM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added the JSONObject database function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One interesting use case is serializing objects directly in the DB, bypassing the need to create ORM objects:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>F</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>JSONObject</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>=</span><span>JSONObject</span><span>(</span>
    <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'obj'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>()</span>

<span>({</span>
    <span>'id'</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'Haki Benita'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>:</span> <span>'2021-04-25T00:00:00'</span><span>,</span>
<span>},)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We already showed how crucial <a href="https://hakibenita.com/django-rest-framework-slow">serialization performance</a> can be, so this is something to consider.</p>

<h2 id="loud-signal-receiver"><a href="#loud-signal-receiver">Loud Signal Receiver</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32261" rel="noopener">Ticket #32261</a></p>
<p>A while back I <a href="https://twitter.com/be_haki/status/1335921247306264579?s=20" rel="noopener">twitted about a mysterious bug</a> I had that went unnoticed for a long time because it happened inside a signal receiver.</p>
<p>When you use <code>send_robust</code> to broadcast signals, if the signal fails, Django keeps the error and moves on to the next receiver. After all of the receivers processed the signal, Django returns a list with the receivers' return values and exceptions. To check if any of the receivers failed, you need to go over the list and check for instances of <code>Exception</code>. Signals are often used to decouple modules, and handing exceptions from receivers this way defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>To make sure I don't miss exceptions in signal receivers again, I created a "loud signal receiver" that logs exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.dispatch</span> <span>import</span> <span>receiver</span>

<span>def</span> <span>loud_receiver</span><span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>logger</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Subscribe to Django signal and log errors from the receiver function.</span>

<span>    When using `send_robust` to send Django Signals, errors happening in the</span>
<span>    receivers are kept and returned. Because signals are mostly used for decoupling</span>
<span>    modules, the return value from `send_robust` is often dismissed.</span>
<span>    To make it easier not to miss errors from Django signal receivers, use this decorator</span>
<span>    instead to log the exceptions to a specific logger.</span>

<span>    NOTE: Not necessary as of Django 3.2</span>

<span>    Example:</span>
<span>        logger = logging.getLogger('some.logger')</span>
<span>        @loud_receiver(signals.SomeSignal, logger=logger, dispatch_uid='uid')</span>
<span>        def receiver_func():</span>
<span>            pass</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_decorator</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>loud_func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>):</span>
            <span>try</span><span>:</span>
                <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>)</span>
            <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
                <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>exception</span><span>(</span><span>'exception from signal receiver'</span><span>)</span>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>A couple of weeks ago I read an interesting post on Reddit (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/jvjskn/anyone_have_experience_with_chinese_zynq_boards/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/jvjskn/anyone_have_experience_with_chinese_zynq_boards/" target="_blank">here</a>, and also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackaday/comments/jwf3h4/hacking_the_fpga_control_board_from_a_bitcoin/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackaday/comments/jwf3h4/hacking_the_fpga_control_board_from_a_bitcoin/" target="_blank">here</a>). Seems like some crypto-mining farms were closed or reworked and therefore the online market was flooded with what seems to be crypto-miner control boards. The interesting stuff is that these are based on a Zynq z7010 and are sold for as low as 10€ per piece on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=zynq+7000" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=zynq+7000" target="_blank">Aliexpress</a>. If you compare these PCBs with the price of the Zynq alone, this is really really cheap! Although there are already multiple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205" target="_blank">posts</a> mentioning the schematic and hardware in use, most of them lack details on the FPGA and Linux point of view. In the upcoming series of posts, I will try to tests its functionality, document problems or pitfalls (if any) encountered during the hardware “bring-up”, and provide some form of BSP (Board Support Package) for the board so that it can be used in any project.</p>



<h2>The Hardware</h2>



<p>No matter where you order, usually have two options, the board as is (with boot device NAND Flash) or with modifications so that the boot mode is set to SD-Card. I ordered the version with SD-Card, UART- and JTAG-Header already mounted. The condition of the board was quite nice, with only some small scratches on the bottom. After I cleaned the soldering pads, the PCB was almost perfect.</p>







<p>Some of the main components on the board, including headers, are highlighted below. The best resource for the schematic is probably <a href="https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. However, be aware, that the schematic does not reflect the state of the board to 100% when ordered with “SD-Card mounted”, since the boot mode pins were altered!</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Zynq XC7Z010-1CLG400C (green)</li><li>Ethernet PHY 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX (orange)</li><li>EtronTech 256MB DDR3 (yellow)</li><li>Winbond NAND Flash 128MB (blue)</li><li>33.333MHz Oszillator for PS (orange)</li><li>UART-Header J7 (white)</li><li>JTAG-Header J8 (magenta)</li><li>…</li></ul>




</div>
</div>



<h2>The Setup</h2>



<p>With the version of the PCB that I received, it was not possible to power the board with J4 (power connector at the bottom right in the image above). The reason for this is, that D24 is marked on the schematic as NC (not connected), and indeed, the diode is missing on the PCB. Therefore I had to use Pin 1/3 on any of the connectors DATA1-3. The board requires 12V on these pins and uses about 60mA if no SD-Card is inserted (in case you want to make sure it does not light up when connected for the first time). A simple USB to UART module connected to the pins on J7 (see above) will provide us a debugging interface.</p>

<h2>The Software</h2>



<p>I used the following <a data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wQKpiYsH0gQ7KmnnYMrmFdCxwkF3WS4/view?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wQKpiYsH0gQ7KmnnYMrmFdCxwkF3WS4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Buildroot image</a>, which was already verified to work in order to boot the board for the first time. I also created a <a data-type="URL" data-id="https://mega.nz/file/sN4kgQCS#7P3qanUhiiZYH8z0iqO4ExUfTPlSWlgE7A2JuavI8C4" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mega.nz/file/sN4kgQCS#7P3qanUhiiZYH8z0iqO4ExUfTPlSWlgE7A2JuavI8C4" target="_blank">mirror</a> in case the link does not work any longer (MD5 of the image: e5349351fc30bfcf91e4fa5b8e3b3cbe). If you are on Windows, Win32 Disk Imager can be used to write the image to an SD-Card. On Linux, using dd is probably the simplest method.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="205" src="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/win32_disk_imager.png" alt="" srcset="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/win32_disk_imager.png 405w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/win32_disk_imager-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"></figure>



<p>Once the system is up and running you are greeted with a serial terminal. For this image the login is <em>root/root</em>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="938" height="68" src="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb.png" alt="" srcset="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb.png 938w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb-300x22.png 300w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb-768x56.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px"></figure>



<p>At this point, we have come quite far with minimal work. We already know that the Power Supply, Zynq, DDR, and hardware modifications for SD-Boot are fine! I decided that the PHY/Ethernet is probably something that also needs to be checked at this point. Therefore, I modified the existing network configuration in <em>/etc/network/interface</em>s to make use of DHCP:</p>



<pre><code>auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp</code></pre>



<p>Finally, I made sure that the Port on my local gateway supports 100MBit (correlates with the PHYs capabilities) and also that DHCP is enabled. The figure below shows the end of the boot process when <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://udhcp.busybox.net/README.udhcpc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://udhcp.busybox.net/README.udhcpc" target="_blank">udhcpc </a></em>gets an IP address assigned and we are able to send some greetings to google.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="942" height="680" src="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb.png" alt="" srcset="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb.png 942w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb-300x217.png 300w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb-768x554.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></figure>



<p>I know, there is still some part missing in our verification – the NAND Flash, however, since there was no device in <em>/sys/class/mtd/</em>, I assume that the flash was not part of the device-tree and/or the driver is not compiled into the kernel. TBH, I don’t really care about this right now and will deal with it at a later point.</p>



<h2>What’s next</h2>



<p>I think we came quite far with only a couple of minutes of work! Of cause, this post relied on work that has previously been done by others, but it acts as a starting point. We did not write a single line of code, nor we had to deal with Yocto, Buildroot, or a bare-metal application for verification, and still, we can be quite certain that our hardware works.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://embed-me.com/ebaz4205-recycle-cheap-crypto-miner-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2</a> of this series, we will make our own FPGA design using Vivado. This will then act as a starting point for our custom Linux distribution for the EBAZ4205 board.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Hot on the heels of Linode offering up AMD EPYC processors, DigitalOcean has
started to offer “premium” CPUs as part of their Shared CPU Basic plans.
Unfortunately, this new offering comes with a slightly elevated price, clocking
in at $6 per month instead of $5.</p>
<p>This new product offering lines up with Vultr’s “High Frequency” plans, with not
just a choice of Intel or AMD processor, but also NVMe SSDs. With the price
being a bit higher, I won’t be reviewing that particular plan on this post. If
the trend happens to continue with another provider, I’ll probably end up doing
a $6 Showdown as well as this $5 one.</p>
<p>As always, I spun up 3 instances of each provider’s $5 instances, in or around
the New York area, running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I’ve averaged the results where
applicable.</p>

                    <p>Cloud provisioning is a critical element of the modern cloud computing model.
We live in the age of microservices, where <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/the-benefits-of-it-automation-and-why-you-should-start-using-it-now/" title="Post about automation benefits">automation</a> is not a
nice-to-have anymore. It became an integral part of everyday operations.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a wide variety of <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to configuration management">automation and orchestration
tools</a> out there. Those tools can save us time while simultaneously
increasing the performance and accuracy of provisioning and configuration
management processes.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the benefits of <strong>cloud automation with
Ansible</strong>.  We will discuss several use cases that illustrate the power this
tool presents in the areas of provisioning, configuration, and compliance.</p>
<h2 id="ansibles-role-in-cloud-automation">Ansible’s role in cloud automation</h2>
<p>Ansible is, first and foremost, an automation tool. Given the right content
(roles, modules, and other plugins), Ansible can automate almost anything. And
cloud management is no exception, which means that we can automate our
provisioning processes with relative ease.</p>
<p>With a little help from continuous integration and continuous deployment
(CI/CD) products, Ansible can transform into a mighty orchestration tool. We
can start combining standalone tasks into complex workflows that automate
complex IT processes.</p>
<p>And if we bind workflow executions to events from our monitoring systems, we
made some serious steps towards self-healing infrastructure.</p>
<p>But none of the previously described things are possible if we do not have
<strong>Ansible integration for the cloud provider</strong> of our choice.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-cloud-providers-have-ansible-integrations">Why should cloud providers have Ansible integrations?</h2>
<p>The traditional model for many businesses is to have infrastructure
provisioning processes separated from the configuration management workflows.
And while configuration management is often (at least partially) automated, it
is not uncommon for system administrators to manage infrastructure manually,
which is slow, laborious, and error-prone.</p>
<p>By provisioning cloud infrastructure with Ansible, system administrators can
perform day one and day two operations using a modern and reliable tool. And
the Ansible playbooks used to manage cloud resources also serve as
human-readable and machine-executable documentation.</p>
<p>Many users already use Ansible for their non-infrastructure automation needs.
Having a high-quality Ansible integration offers a seamless transition for such
users, unifying their management tools.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Ansible integration as a cloud provider will raise the confidence
and improve cloud customers’ user experience.</strong></p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-ansible-for-cloud-automation">Benefits of using Ansible for cloud automation</h2>
<p>Ansible is not the only tool that we can use to manage cloud resources. But
because of its simplicity and flexibility, it does offer quite a few advantages
compared to similar utilities.</p>
<p><strong>No need for a separate configuration management tool.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible is so
powerful, we can provision cloud resources, configure the operating system, and
then install and configure the application on top. We can do this using a
single Ansible playbook if we wish. Chaining together multiple Ansible
playbooks is a more flexible alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Less vendor lock-in.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible modules serve as a thin abstraction layer over
the cloud provider’s application programming interface (API). Abstraction gives
the freedom and flexibility to switch between different cloud providers at any
time with minimal effort. And it enables us to work with multiple clouds
simultaneously without risking the cloud-specific tools overload.</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly automation layer.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible playbooks are YAML files that
describe the desired state of the system we want to manage. Writing Ansible
playbooks requires no prior development or programming experience. And there
are plenty of online resources to help us with the Ansible playbook authoring
process.</p>
<h2 id="ansible-use-cases-for-cloud">Ansible use cases for cloudÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As already stated before, we can use Ansible to manage almost anything. But in
this section, we will look at three different cloud-related use cases that
benefit significantly from Ansible’s involvement.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-cloud-resources">Creating new cloud resources</h3>
<p>Creating a new virtual machine does not sound too complicated. We need to click
a few buttons, and that is it. Right? Well, in reality, things are never this
simple. Because before we create a new virtual machine, we may need to create a
virtual private cloud that will host our resources. And set up a security group
(think firewall). And create an internet gateway. And make sure we have our SSH
keys ready. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>We can describe all those steps in a reusable Ansible playbook once and then
run them as many times as needed. We can also parameterize our Ansible
playbook. Parameterization allows us to modify the deployment process without
having to edit the Ansible playbook. And with a little help from Ansible Tower,
we can package our parameterized Ansible playbook into a self-service catalog
item anyone can use.</p>
<h3 id="managing-existing-cloud-resources">Managing existing cloud resources</h3>
<p>Ansible can use a cloud provider as a source of information about existing
resources. This dynamic approach makes manual inventory management a thing of
the past. We can now manage hundreds of servers without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Combining dynamic inventory with Ansible’s ability to execute operations in
batches, we get a potent tool for performing rolling updates of clusters.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-compliance">Ensuring compliance</h3>
<p>If we follow the best practices when authoring our Ansible playbooks, we will
produce a concise description of the desired state. We already know that
Ansible will, when executing the instructions, robustly enforce this state on
the managed node.</p>
<p>But we can reuse the same description to detect unauthorized or unintentional
configuration changes, commonly referred to as configuration drift. Running
Ansible in check mode will produce a list of deviations from the desired state.
For example, we can detect changes to security group rules.</p>

<p>Although we focused our attention on the cloud today, we looked at it through
the eyes of an Ansible user. For example, we talked about the desired state of
resources and change detection, which are the two most fundamental things
Ansible users expect from Ansible integration.</p>
<p>Cloud providers often only think about the cloud functionality they offer when
setting up an Ansible integration. Typically, this leads to poorly-designed
Ansible content that feels out of place when used in Ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>Creating a high-quality Ansible integration is far more than just wrapping an
existing cloud API. Ensuring modules have a public API that follows Ansible’s
best practices, setting up a robust test suite, and properly documenting the
content are just a few things each high-quality Ansible Collection needs.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/should-you-build-or-outsource-the-development-of-ansible-collections/" title="Article with pros and cons of outsourcing Ansible Collection development">outsourcing the development of Ansible Collections</a> to experts,
cloud providers get a high-quality Ansible integration while allowing them to
focus their efforts on their primary product.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Ansible is probably the only widely-used automation tool that <strong>allows us to
describe the whole deployment uniformly</strong>: from the provisioning phase to the
holistic configuration of the applications that run on top of the cloud
resources.</p>
<p>Ansible Collections play a central role in Ansible’s flexibility. They provide,
among other things, integrations with cloud providers that unlock
cloud-management capabilities. If appropriately designed, Ansible Collections
significantly improve user experience and remove barriers to adoption, bringing
benefits to both customers and cloud providers.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>For this sonification project, our team chose to map the contemporaneous spread of the Coronavirus from China to the rest of the world. This is obviously a phenomenon that is ongoing, so being able to update the sonification as new data came in was an important consideration.</p>

<p>After initial discussions, we developed a game plan to create our sonification using widely-available data from John Hopkins, CDC, etc. on the following parameters of the pandemic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Confirmed cases</li>
  <li>Total Recovered</li>
  <li>Total Fatalities</li>
</ol>

<p>Our initial idea was to create a worldwide “orchestra” of sounds by superimposing the layout of a traditional symphony orchestra over a map of the world. By rotating the symphonic layout 90 degrees counter-clockwise, we centered the strings over China with the rest of the orchestra fanning out in a westward direction (see fig.1). We quickly realized that it would be better to assign instruments by general region rather than country, because with over 80 countries reporting at the time of this writing, we would not only quickly run out of instruments, but also run the risk of creating sonic soup out of the data.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows our initial thinking on how to approach the instrumentation by region.</p>

    <figcaption>Fig 1 Initial Instrument Assignments By Region</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This mapping made sense to us, as the strings make up the traditional core of the symphony orchestra, and situating them over the “epicenter” of the pandemic puts the bulk of the instruments in the same area where the bulk of the data is coming from. At the same time, our hope was that the remaining instruments, representing areas with much less data, would still be distinct in the overall soundscape.</p>

<p>Our plan was to sonify the data in the following way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Daily-updated confirmed cases data for each region would be assigned to pitch data and sent to individual instruments in a DAW. As the number of cases reached a certain threshold, a new note would be triggered, and the sound would become more complex.</li>
  <li>Recovery data would be represented by a percussion instrument, such as crotales, which would sound a single note each time the data crossed a pre-set threshold.</li>
  <li>Fatalities would be represented in the same way as recoveries, using a lower- pitched percussion instrument such as the tympani to place it in a different sound spectrum to keep it distinct.</li>
</ol>

<p>As we will describe later, we decided to drop the second and third points in this plan, focusing only on the confirmed-cases data. However, we did add one additional data stream we had not noticed initially, the daily rate of increase in the numbers. After observing a few large spikes in these numbers, we decided that this was important data that could not be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Python programming for real-time data delivery was done by Simon in Trondheim. The program is designed to grab the needed data from the web and send it to Pd as OSC messages. Although we did not wind up using the Python program in our final demonstration on Friday (06.22.20), as the Oslo contingent had set up Pd to read data from a static csv file, this work will not be wasted, as we will need this to further implement our sonification in a dynamic webpage (see: Future Work, below.)</p>

<p>Rayam, Paul, and Dongho on the Oslo side collaborated on implementing the sonification in PureData and Logic. The first task was to separate the data by region, and assign an instrument or set of instruments to each. We created eight regions, with each region’s center point represented by it’s latitude and longitude. See fig. 2.
Every reporting country’s coordinates are compared with these set numbers to determine which region they belonged in. Using the Pythagorean theorem (a2+b2=c2) we triangulated the location in comparison to the predetermined set points, and then sent each data string to one of eight channels assigned to each one of the selected regions.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://mct-master.github.io/assets/image/2020_03_09_aleksati_Instrumentation_By_Region.png" width="640" height="180">
    <figcaption>Fig. 2 Final Orchestral Layout</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each incoming data string consists of Country, Lat, Long, Day #1, Day #2, etc. Each day’s number represents the increase in either confirmed cases, recovered cases, or deaths. Using the (zl slice) object in Pd, we separate the map coordinates from the daily numbers. Each data string is then separated by region, using the method described above. The daily numbers are used to trigger midi notes, a new note being added every time the daily numbers exceed a certain threshold, and sent to the DAW.</p>

<p>After working with the “confirmed cases” data for a while, we became aware of an important parameter in the numbers that we had initially ignored. The day-to-day cases occasionally registered huge spikes in the numbers that seemed quite significant. We wished to devise a way to represent this in the sonification. For this reason, we decided to focus on only the sonification of the confirmed-case data for this stage of the project, in consideration of our time constraints.</p>

<p>In order to make sense of the spikes in the numbers, we created a sub-patch in Pd that compares each day’s number with the previous day, subtracting the prior day’s number from the current. This number is converted to midi note information and sent to DAW, triggering an arpeggio that becomes more complex as the numbers grow in value. Hence, larger daily spikes in daily case numbers are reflected in the soundscape as arpeggios covering a wider note range.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the assignment of instruments by region. Instrument one represents the daily increase in confirmed cases, while instrument two represents the rate of increase between consecutive days.</p>

<p>Implementation in Logic was reasonably straightforward, though involved quite a bit of routing work and setting proper ranges for each instrument, setting up the arpeggiator, etc. We tried to stay within “appropriate” ranges for each instrument, although properly constraining each instrument with its idiomatic bounds would take more time than we had for the project.</p>

<h3 id="sonification">Sonification</h3>

<p>There was a huge amount of data to work with, and we needed to narrow our focus on just a few data points in order to be able to create a sonification that was faithful to the data without creating an aurally confusing soundscape. Therefore, we chose to work with only the confirmed cases dataset, from which we also derived the daily rate of increase. Extracting the data, making sense of it in Pd, then configuring the DAW took quite a bit of time, with much thanks to Georgio, Jarle and others for their invaluable input.</p>

<p>Each day’s worth of data is allotted 3000ms of sonic space to unfold. Each region’s data is delayed slightly from the prior region to allow the data sonic space to be better understood by the listener. See fig. 3.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://mct-master.github.io/assets/image/2020_03_09_aleksati_Delay_Onset.png" width="398" height="304">
    <figcaption>Fig. 3 Delay Onset By Region</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the final mix, care was taken to level each track so that all instruments could be heard. Binaural panning was used to give each region (and its instruments) its own position in the sonic landscape, though this only apparent when listening through headphones.</p>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>

</p>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>

<p>There is still much that could be done to fully implement this data.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Implement more data. The recovery and fatality data could be added to the overall sonification, with some care taken toward not overloading the listeners’ ears with too much information. One possible way to convey meaning with the recovery and fatality data is to consider them as “resolved” cases, and at set threshold levels in the resolved cases, remove a commensurate amount of confirmed cases from the sonification. In this way, the composition would eventually come to an end as the coronavirus is either contained and defeated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instrumentation. We feel that the data is mostly well-represented by our instrument choices, but with careful listening and experimentation, it’s quite possible that we could improve the clarity of the sonification by changing instruments, adjusting range parameters, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dynamic webpage. A very worthy addition to this project would be to create a dynamic webpage that incorporates a time-elapsed heat map to provide a visual reference for the unfolding sonification, as well as tools for the viewer/listener to rewind, change speed, and play the data by region. This would involve the creation of an online orchestra using a sample library, as we would not be able to use Logic. Also we would need to implement the ongoing updates pulled from the GitHub database that Simon created tools for in Trondheim.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Although there is a lot more work that could be done to fully implement all of our ideas, we are encouraged by our results and will continue to work towards a full implementation of this sonification.</p>

<p>It can take weeks to train a neural network on large datasets. Luckily, this time can be shortened thanks to model weights from pre-trained models – in other words, applying <strong>transfer learning</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Transfer learning </a>is a technique that works in image classification tasks and natural language processing tasks. In this article, you’ll dive into:</p>


<div>
<ul><li>what transfer learning is,</li><li>how to implement transfer learning (in Keras),</li><li>transfer learning for image classification,</li><li>transfer learning for natural language processing</li></ul>
</div>


<p>Well then, let’s start learning! (no pun intended… ok, maybe a little)&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="transfer-learning-overview">What is transfer learning?</h2>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-from-pre-trained-models-f2393f124751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Transfer learning is about leveraging feature representations from a pre-trained model</a>, so you don’t have to train a new model from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pre-trained models are usually trained on massive datasets that are a standard benchmark in the computer vision frontier. The weights obtained from the models can be reused in other computer vision tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These models can be used directly in making predictions on new tasks or integrated into the process of training a new model. Including the pre-trained models in a new model leads to lower training time and lower generalization error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transfer learning is particularly very useful when you have a small training dataset. In this case, you can, for example, use the weights from the pre-trained models to <strong>initialize the weights</strong> of the new model. As you will see later, transfer learning can also be applied to natural language processing problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advantage of pre-trained models is that they are generic enough for use in other real-world applications. For example:</p>


<div>
<ul><li><strong>models trained on the ImageNet</strong> can be used in real-world image classification problems. This is because the dataset contains over 1000 classes. Let’s say you are an insect researcher. You can use these models and fine-tune them to classify insects.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>classifying text requires knowledge of word representations</strong> in some vector space. You can train vector representations yourself. The challenge here is that you might not have enough data to train the embeddings. Furthermore, training will take a long time. In this case, you can use a pre-trained word embedding like GloVe to hasten your development process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>


<p>You will explore these use cases in a moment.</p>



<h3>What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?</h3>



<p><strong>Fine-tuning </strong>is an optional step in transfer learning. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/What-is-the-difference-between-Transfer-Learning-vs-Fine-Tuning-vs-Learning-from-scratch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fine-tuning will usually improve the performance</a> of the model. However, since you have to retrain the entire model, you’ll likely overfit.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Overfitting is avoidable. Just retrain the model or part of it using a <strong>low learning rate</strong>. This is important because it prevents significant updates to the gradient. These updates result in poor performance. Using a callback to stop the training process when the model has stopped improving is also helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why use transfer learning?</h3>



<p>Assuming you have 100 images of cats and 100 dogs and want to build a model to classify the images. How would you train a model using this small dataset? You can train your model from scratch, but it will most likely overfit horribly. Enter transfer learning. Generally speaking, there are two big reasons why you want to use transfer learning:</p>


<div>
<ul><li><strong>training models with high accuracy requires a lot of data</strong>. For example, the ImageNet dataset contains over 1 million images. In the real world, you are unlikely to have such a large dataset.&nbsp;</li><li>assuming that you had that kind of dataset, you might still <strong>not have the resources required to train a model </strong>on such a large dataset. Hence transfer learning makes a lot of sense if you don’t have the compute resources needed to train models on huge datasets.&nbsp;</li><li>even if you had the compute resources at your disposal, you still have to<strong> wait for days or weeks to train such a model</strong>. Therefore using a pre-trained model will save you precious time.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>


<h3>When does transfer learning not work?</h3>



<p>Transfer learning will not work when the high-level features learned by the bottom layers are not sufficient to differentiate the classes in your problem. For example, a pre-trained model may be very good at identifying a door but not whether a door is closed or open. In this case, you can use the low-level features (of the pre-trained network) instead of the high-level features. In this case, you will have to retrain more layers of the model or use features from earlier layers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When datasets are not similar, features transfer poorly. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper</a> investigates the similarity of datasets in more detail. That said, as shown in the paper, initializing the network with pre-trained weights results in better performance than using random weights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might find yourself in a situation where you consider the removal of some layers from the pre-trained model. Transfer learning is unlikely to work in such an event. This is because removing layers reduces the number of trainable parameters, which can result in overfitting.&nbsp; Furthermore, determining the correct number of layers to remove without overfitting is a cumbersome and time-consuming process.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="transfer-learning-implement">How to implement transfer learning?</h2>



<p>Let’s now take a moment and look at how you can implement transfer learning.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Transfer learning in 6 steps</h3>



<p>You can implement transfer learning in these six general steps.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="40785" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/transfer-learning-guide-examples-for-images-and-text-in-keras/transfer-learning-steps" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?fit=921%2C68&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="921,68" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Transfer-learning-steps" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?fit=300%2C22&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?fit=921%2C68&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="921" height="68" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=921%2C68&amp;ssl=1" alt="Transfer learning steps" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?w=921&amp;ssl=1 921w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=300%2C22&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=768%2C57&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=270%2C20&amp;ssl=1 270w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=21%2C2&amp;ssl=1 21w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=140%2C10&amp;ssl=1 140w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=50%2C4&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>











<h4>Obtain the pre-trained model</h4>



<p>The first step is to get the <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-trained model</a> that you would like to use for your problem. The various sources of pre-trained models are covered in a separate section.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Create a base model</h4>



<p>Usually, the first step is to instantiate the <strong>base mode</strong>l using one of the architectures such as ResNet or Xception. You can also optionally download the <strong>pre-trained weights</strong>. If you don’t download the weights, you will have to use the architecture to train your model from scratch. Recall that the base model will usually have more units in the final output layer than you require. When creating the base model, you, therefore, have to remove the final output layer. Later on, you will add a final output layer that is compatible with your problem.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="40787" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/transfer-learning-guide-examples-for-images-and-text-in-keras/transfer-learning-base-model" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?fit=1367%2C1000&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1367,1000" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Transfer-learning-base-model" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?fit=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?fit=1024%2C749&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=512%2C375&amp;ssl=1" alt="Transfer learning base model" width="512" height="375" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=1024%2C749&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=768%2C562&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=98%2C72&amp;ssl=1 98w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=21%2C15&amp;ssl=1 21w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=55%2C40&amp;ssl=1 55w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=41%2C30&amp;ssl=1 41w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<h4>Freeze layers so they don’t change during training</h4>



<p>Freezing the layers from the pre-trained model is vital. This is because you don’t want the <strong>weights in those layers to be re-initialized</strong>. If they are, then you will lose all the learning that has already taken place. This will be no different from training the model from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>base_model.trainable = <span>False</span></pre>







<h4>Add new trainable layers&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The next step is to <strong>add new trainable layers</strong> that will turn old features into predictions on the new dataset. This is important because the pre-trained model is loaded without the final output layer.&nbsp;</p>







<h4>Train the new layers on the dataset</h4>



<p>Remember that the pre-trained model’s final output will most likely be different from the output that you want for your model. For example, pre-trained models trained on the ImageNet dataset will output 1000 classes. However, your model might just have two classes. In this case, you have to train the model with a new output layer in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, you will add some new dense layers as you please, but most importantly, a final dense layer with <strong>units corresponding to the number of outputs expected by your model</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Improve the model via fine-tuning</h4>



<p>Once you have done the previous step, you will have a model that can make predictions on your dataset. Optionally, you can improve its <strong>performance through fine-tuning</strong>. Fine-tuning is done by unfreezing the base model or part of it and training the entire model again on the whole dataset at a very low learning rate. The low learning rate will increase the performance of the model on the new dataset while preventing overfitting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The learning rate has to be low because the model is quite large while the dataset is small. This is a recipe for overfitting, hence the low learning rate. Recompile the model once you have made these changes so that they can take effect. This is because the behavior of a model is frozen whenever you call the compile function. That means that you have to call the compile function again whenever you want to change the model’s behavior. The next step will be to train the model again while monitoring it via callbacks to ensure it does not overfit.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Pretty straightforward, eh?</p>



<h3>Where to find pre-trained models?</h3>



<p>Let’s now talk about where you can find pre-trained models to use in your applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Keras pre-trained models</h4>



<p>There are more than two dozen pre-trained models available from Keras. They’re served via <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Keras applications</strong></a><strong>.</strong> You get pre-trained weights alongside each model. When you download a model, the weights are downloaded automatically. They will be stored in `~/.keras/models/.` All the Keras applications are used for image tasks. For instance, here is how you can initialize the MobileNet architecture trained on ImageNet.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNet(
    input_shape=<span>None</span>,
    alpha=<span>1.0</span>,
    depth_multiplier=<span>1</span>,
    dropout=<span>0.001</span>,
    include_top=<span>True</span>,
    weights=<span>"imagenet"</span>,
    input_tensor=<span>None</span>,
    pooling=<span>None</span>,
    classes=<span>1000</span>,
    classifier_activation=<span>"softmax"</span>,
)</pre>



<h4>Transfer learning using TensorFlow Hub</h4>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Keras applications are not your only option for transfer learning tasks. You can also use models from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>TensorFlow Hub</strong></a>.</p>



<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
 hub.KerasLayer(<span>"https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector/4"</span>,
                   trainable=<span>False</span>), 
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=<span>'softmax'</span>)
])</pre>



<h4>Pretrained word embeddings</h4>



<p><strong>Word embeddings </strong>are usually used for text classification problems. In as much as you can train your word embeddings, using a pre-trained one is much quicker. Here are a couple of word embeddings that you can consider for your natural language processing problems:</p>

<p>Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.</p>

<p>Remember when we used to hug our friends with a slightly different political view than us. Remember when we switch on the news and make fun of whatever dumb shit those politicians were pulling of. Remember when opinions were objective and not personal.</p>

<p>Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well formed, so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument. I have seen decade old friendships end, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of differing political opinions.</p>

<p>We do have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn’t make everything a part of their identity. Where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a fist fight. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.</p>



<p>There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us it was that point when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it’s glorious forms aren’t  inherently bad, it’s when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep tabs of your friends and family, start to keep tabs on you.</p>

<p>Advertisement has always been about attention, that’s why big billboards are lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won’t need. The sole purpose is to turn your head and to make you take notice. They don’t care who sees it, they just care a lot of us do.</p>

<p>A lot of advertisement on the early days of the internet were similar, they would put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather the most eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in ad town from  then on, and the companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the ones who didn’t started dying out. (Too far ? yeah too far)</p>

<p>After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladly served them up on a plate.</p>

<p>But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do, they started manufacturing them.</p>

<p>Big Social realized that the people who  engage  most, who  drive the most revenue are the ones obsessed with the content. They are the most  revenue generating cattle of the ranch, and since everything is a numbers game they started to maximize obsessiveness. Well how do you manufacture people who would die for their views ? How do you manufacture obsessiveness ? Bubbles.</p>

<h2 id="enter-bubbles">Enter Bubbles</h2>

<p>The more the number of positive reinforcement that a person receives about their already existing viewpoints and the more number  of negative reinforcements they see around the opposing ones, the more likely they are to believe their beliefs are true. The more they are engrossed in their bubbles the more they are susceptible to being obsessed.</p>

<p>The  first  time we sign-up for it, they don’t know anything about us. So they ask us for our interests and to add our closest friends. Based on that they show us some generic content  based on our and  our friends interests. Then we start interacting with them, each and every interaction, each and  every pause is recorded and measured and converted  to a  data point. Initially the content is neutral, leaning just to the side  of our interests and our beliefs. The more we interact with it, the more the virtual  profile of ourselves get optimized. With our likes and shares and comments  we build an echo chamber around ourselves, with help from a  black box algorithm designed to optimize  for obsessiveness.</p>

<p>But an echo chamber doesn’t make you and obsessed radical, what makes you one is shock.</p>

<h2 id="enter-shock">Enter Shock</h2>

<p>Shock is what pushes your towards the edge of obsessiveness. Content that has high shock value are borderline impossible to believe. They rock your belief system and lingers on the edge of possibility. It’s purpose is not to make you believe the content right away, but to expand and reinforce your viewpoint so much so that you believe a little more polarized content than what you are used to. That is how you manufacture obsessiveness, that’s how your manufacture  polarization. The cycle is repeated indefinitely nudging you little by little to the edge, until you fall  o ver. Is  it  intentional or  a  byproduct  of an algorithm optimized for profit and engagement maximization is up for debate.</p>

<p>Consider me and Youtube. Like every teenager I had trouble with the ladies and like any other teenager I turned  to the internet for help. I started with dating videos, content which I  was looking for. Then slowly my recommended feed stared to show just one or two videos on how women were the problem of modern society, not enough to turn me to a believer but just enough to shock me. Having been exposed to that I started to normalize videos that bash feminism, SJW’s being owned and rants about how women are the problem. Then my feed started to get populated with  even more  anti-women and videos around red-pill and the manosphere. I am not saying these viewpoints are right or  wrong, but they were shocking  and normalized  a lot  of stuff that I would never have accepted if I was shown then from the start. After a while I started believing a lot of the what was being said, I was starting to suffocate in my own bubble. Luckily I used to read a lot outside the internet and hence had access to contrasting view points. That’s when I realized how deep in the rabbit hole I was. This prompted me to seek out alternate viewpoints and form my own opinions.  If I had kept going I would most probably have turned  into an angry fanatic thirsty for blood on the internet, shouting on some obscure forum on the edge of the internet.</p>

<p>That’s what  the algorithms are designed to do. They have the maximum engagement and attention from how obsessed their users  are. For being obsessed it’s not only vital that you  push the view point forward but also to demean and dehumanize the opposing one, so much so to the point that you believe the views that they hold are clearly wrong.  It pushes us into an us vs them mentality, where we are on right ones  and they are the wrong ones.</p>

<p>After a while we start to internalize what we interact with, it becomes a part of your identity.You start to believe the extreme content that you are exposed to as your own, you start to defend it with all your might.  You can’t entertain an  argument  because it is no  longer an argument  against your opinion,but one against  your identity. To entertain any argument is to acknowledge you are wrong and to prove everything you have interacted with for a long time to be wrong. This is  what  polarizes  us, this is what makes having a friendly conversation about opposing  views impossible in this  day and age. This is what is being done to us. We are divided  by opinions cocooned in our own bubbles, our own  echo chambers which enforce our beliefs and makes us immune to any counter  argument no matter how right or wrong.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-out">Breaking Out</h2>

<p>It’s not easy and fun getting out once you are inside. It’s like the matrix you see and hear and interact with an artificial world designed to hook you in, and like Neo it’s one hell of a ride to unplug. It’s hard but it’s possible, this is how I  did it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear the data that they have on you, take away the data and take away the power.</li>
<li>Humanize the opposing view points and the people who make  them. Realize they too have a valid point and that they believe it enough to defend it with all their heart.</li>
<li>Seek out alternate view points, it’s kind of a fun exercise. When you start everything looks stupid and dumb, persist and after a while you will feel a switch inside your brain, when you realize they also have a valid point.</li>
<li>Take some time off and  think deeply about everything and put together a version of the reality and form your own opinions based on them.</li>
<li>Refine those opinions  as you learn more about reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<li>Logout of all your Social Media, it’s not that useful anyway</li>
<li>Get a Flip Phone,  looks cooler than  a dumb phone</li>

<h2 id="org9a27545">What to expect from this Essay</h2>
<p>
I’m going to clear up common misconceptions, explain what’s important for a first programming language, introduce the most interesting languages and point to the best (free) learning resources and books.<br>
</p>
</div><div id="outline-container-org2b3e512">
<h2 id="org2b3e512">The hard Part</h2>
<div id="text-org2b3e512">
<p>
“Learning a programming language” is what applies foremost to programmers who already know how to program. For them, picking up a new language is possible within a couple of weeks (and for you too, once you’ve gained some experience), and it does’t matter really that much which one – because the patterns how to accomplish most things are roughly overlapping.<br>
</p>

<p>
But if you start out, you don’t need to just learn a programming language. <b>First, you want to learn how to program</b>. It means learning how to analyze a problem you want to tackle, finding a solution and express it in code, which is often not intuitive. Plus, you still have to learn a programming language with syntax and semantics, too. So that is two things at once.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div><div id="outline-container-org0cd2593">
<h2 id="org0cd2593">What do you want to do?</h2>
<div id="text-org0cd2593">
<p>
Is it your plan to become a software developer? Software is built in different areas – the most obvious within the web, is obviously the development of itself. But there are other areas than web frontend and web backend; like fintech, aircraft systems, robotics, telecom, water supply or internet of things. If you know exactly what your intentions are, you could start with a language of your specific field and go form there. Or maybe better not?<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“It’s crucial that you understand<br>
the principles behind programming<br>
that transcend the specifics<br>
of any specific language.”<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The industry workhorse is probably not the right one, because it could be either highly specific and/or come with a lot of distracting things that don’t matter for you right now. There’s a reason one doe not take first driving on a bucket wheel excavator, but on a … yes, car. Or motorbike.  If you pick the wrong one, you might not follow through. Life changes and programming is hard. So you should go with a language that’s interesting to you – for whatever reason – and which is particularly suitable for learning, according to the criteria I lay out below. Read on, I will describe the most interesting languages further down.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may want to learn programming, even if you have no plans to become a part of the software producing workforce, like me. I’ve worked quite a long time as a designer and in the online marketing industry, but have barely written any code at all, since there were always developers working alongside me and tasked with the wizardry.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I have always been interested in computer stuff, so I’ve dabbled a lot with Linux, server administration and tweaking my configs as a means of procrastination. Real programming was the magical border I haven’t crossed – until recently.<br>
</p>

<p>
For my part, I want a tool in which I can think, and I’d like to be able to prototype an idea if I have one. Further, I think programming can help us tremendously to develop our minds. I must say that hated mathematics in school and have been really bad at it, but I’m fascinated and eventually I want to know what is this all about.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Life is short –<br>
pull down the curtain,<br>
cast some spells<br>
and wield some magic!”<br>
</p>

<h2 id="orgae6d7f1">What makes a Programming Language beginner-friendly?</h2>

<div id="outline-container-org96ebe92">
<h3 id="org96ebe92">Available Learning Materials</h3>
<div id="text-org96ebe92">
<p>
For which programming language is the right learning material available? This point is huge!<br>
</p>

<p>
Most programming books or courses are not made for absolute beginners, but for programmers who want to <i>learn yet another language</i>. Remember, you want to <i>learn programming</i>, not just a language.<br>
</p>

<p>
“Regular” programming books are not “too advanced” to grasp; it’s just that they <b>teach you the wrong things</b> instead of what you actually need to learn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beware, there’s a lot of crap out there. And the more popular a programming language, the more crap you’ll run into. First, learn how to learn things by yourself (in a way that fits your personality). That skill is likely the most valuable one you’ll ever develop.<br>
</p>

<p>
I recommend a textbook or e-textbook <b>with exercises</b> as your main forge of knowledge, because books are still the most accessible media – you can read a chapter even if you’re queueing up somewhere, re-read each chapter until you got it, and <i>do the exercises</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Generally, I suggest to use material from university profs and/or other reputable personalities to make sure you adopt a well rounded foundation and good style, instead of jumping between random tutorials and bootcamps.<br>
</p>

<p>
I’ve linked the best books below. Most of them come for free! Prepare to dabble with your textbook for quite some time. <i>So you really want an enjoyable one!</i> The most recommended book may not neccesarily be the right one for you; individual taste matters a lot.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="org2d02828">What kind of Animal are you?</h3>
<div id="text-org2d02828">
<p>
It seems there are two different groups of programmers. Those that see programming languages primarily as a means of production (category 1) and those who see it as instrument of human reason (categories 2 and 3):<br>
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Pragmatic languages:</b> conservative, efficient, worse-is-better, boring.<br>
<i>“A programming language is a tool to get the job done”</i><br>
(C, Java, Go)<br></li>
<li><b>Hackish languages:</b> multi-paradigm, anything goes, flexibility, unopinionated.<br>
<i>“I pursue absolute freedom and like to explore the problem domain interactively”</i><br>
(Lisp, Scheme, Javascript)<br></li>
<li><b>Constraining languages:</b> single-paradigm, protecting you from yourself, the-right-thing, opinionated.<br>
<i>“I prefer one correct way according a fixed set of rules”</i><br>
(Elm, Haskell, Python)<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Programming languages are created by different minds, within different eras, significantly influenced by fashion. One language may be a natural fit for a certain personality type, and a less fortunate choice for another. That even applies to programming itself – it’s easier for some and harder for others (doesn’t mean those are more stupid – ok, some really are).<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcbae123">
<h3 id="orgcbae123">Readability and Syntax</h3>
<div id="text-orgcbae123">
<p>
As a novice coder, you’ll need enough brain capacity left to maintain focus on the concepts and what (your) code does, without the language getting in your way. So you want a simple syntax that’s easy to pick up and remember. You don’t want surprises and gotchas.<br>
</p>

<p>
Code is also more often read than written. A clean syntax enables the reader to understand what’s going on in the program. Consistency enables you to derive further things from things you already have learned before and speeds up your learning process.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd46675f">
<h3 id="orgd46675f">Expressive Power and Abstraction</h3>
<p>
Expressivity means how simple it is to say certain things. There are a couple of factors who determine how expressive a programming language can be:<br>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd1205f4">
<h4 id="orgd1205f4">Low-level or High-level?</h4>
<div id="text-orgd1205f4">
<p>
Low-level does not mean “worse” or “inferior” than high-level – it just refers to the fact that computers are built in many layers on top of each other, and the levels close to the physical machine are called the “low level”. You could also call it “foundation”, if you prefer a less judgementally sounding term xP<br>
</p>

<p>
High-level languages tend to be more expressive than low-level languages, because with each layer up, the grade of <i>abstraction</i> increases and more powerful ways to express complex things come into play.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeab952a">
<h4 id="orgeab952a">How simple is it to build Abstractions?</h4>
<div id="text-orgeab952a">
<p>
What is abstraction? It means hiding the foundational workings of the level(s) below (eg. the physical machine) so you don’t have to deal with them directly and can focus on your problem/idea instead.<br>
</p>

<p>
An analogy: A console used to control the lightshow of a concert is an abstraction over fumbling with the electricity cables and tieing them together to make light bulbs glow in a certain order. Now think about doing the light show only by messing with the wires. This is dangerous and way harder (nearly impossible) than using the console. And so it is with programming, too.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org22c2451">
<h4 id="org22c2451">Is it a wordy or concise Language?</h4>
<div id="text-org22c2451">
<p>
Do you have to write a lot of boilerplate or repeat yourself? In most cases you want an expressive high-level language; not overly verbose but also not too concise, so there’s just the right amount of redundancy left to keep it comprehensible.<br>
</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd52f0e3">
<h3 id="orgd52f0e3">Usability and Programming Environment</h3>
<div id="text-orgd52f0e3">
<p>
Your language of choice ideally comes with tooling that’s easy to use. Tooling means things like editor support (syntax highlighting, “jump-to-definition”, looking up documentation), helpful (or at least comprehensible) error messages, and package management for libraries.<br>
</p>

<p>
Libraries are pieces of code written by other programmers that can be re-used, so a developer has less work and doesn’t need to code everything from scratch. A good selection of libraries determines what you can do with a language. Having many libraries is desirable for industrial use, but it doesn’t matter so much in the beginning. Many languages can also use libraries from other programming languages/ecosystems.<br>
</p>

<p>
Consider to pick a language that comes with a <i>REPL</i>, sometimes called <i>console</i> or <i>toplevel</i>. That’s basically like the command line running in a terminal emulator, but instead of shell commands you can run single pieces of your code. Well, nowadays many languages come with a REPL. But some go even further than that and enable true <i>interactive development</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Can you get started without huge ceremonies and fumbling for days?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org998904b">
<h3 id="org998904b">Popularity and Commmunity</h3>
<div id="text-org998904b">
<p>
<i>“Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it’s especially so in programming languages. More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular. Programs often have to work with existing programs, and this is easier if they’re written in the same language, so languages spread from program to program like a virus. And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.”</i><br>

<p>
Popular means just that: popular. It does not mean technically “superior”. Popular languages have some benefits though – for …</p></div></div></div></div>

    <div>
      
<p>The decision by a half dozen of the largest social media companies in the United States to ban President Trump and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/technology/twitter-removes-70000-qanon-accounts.html">thousands</a> of his supporters after their posts instigated the violent invasion of the Capitol building on January 6 raised all kinds of difficult questions about the meaning of freedom of speech in the United States. Was the deplatforming a condemnable act of censorship or a necessary means of preventing future attacks? In what circumstances could incendiary and duplicitous speakers like President Trump justifiably be excluded from the platforms? And who should be responsible for determining the speech rules that govern the social media public sphere? These questions pervaded public debate about what some began to call the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-01/jonathan-zittrain-great-deplatforming">Great Deplatforming</a> and they generated a wide range of answers.</p>



<p>Despite the vigorous debate about freedom of speech raised by the deplatforming, there was wide agreement—at least among lawyers—that the First Amendment provided no help in answering them. Almost all litigators and law professors who weighed in the Great Deplatforming agreed that, while it raised difficult policy questions, it raised no serious First Amendment questions because the social media companies were private actors to whom the First Amendment did not apply. Jameel Jaffer, the Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, eloquently expressed this view when he <a href="https://twitter.com/JameelJaffer/status/1347970483879292928">tweeted</a> that “The First Amendment question is easy. All the other questions are hard.”</p>



<p>The idea that the First Amendment was irrelevant here shocked many outside the law world. Republican politicians in particular <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/first-amendment-regulation/617827/">continued to insist</a> that the social media companies had violated the First Amendment when they banned the President because of his speech.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>The Great Deplatforming may have illuminated many other things, but one thing it clearly spotlighted is how poorly equipped contemporary First Amendment doctrine is for conceptualizing, let alone doing anything about, the threats to freedom of speech that result from private control of the mass public sphere.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The First Amendment’s irrelevance flows almost ineluctably, however, from the rigid framework that the contemporary cases apply to determine its scope. Under existing rules, the Constitution limits only state actors. Private persons confront the Speech Clause in very few circumstances: mostly when they exercise a function that has traditionally been the exclusive prerogative of the government, or when their conduct is coerced or very strongly encouraged by government actors.</p>



<p>Doctrinally, then, the conclusion that the social media companies were private rather than state actors was easy to reach.&nbsp; Running a social media platform is not a public function that has traditionally been performed by the government. Nor did government actors dictate the companies’ deplatforming decisions or even strongly encourage it. Twitter and Facebook came to those decisions on their own.</p>



<p>Most scholars and litigators who assessed the merits of the Great Deplatforming also endorsed the view that the social media companies ideally should not be subject to the Speech Clause, given the significant constraints that it would impose on their ability to regulate user speech that flowed through their platforms. Under existing interpretations, the First Amendment prohibits state actors from almost ever discriminating against speech because of its viewpoint or message. If they were subject to that rule, social media platforms would find it extremely difficult to exclude lies or misinformation, to ban encouragement of violence that did not amount to explicit incitement, or to prohibit the repetition of odious racist stereotypes. Were courts to analogize the platforms to “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/88-2031.ZD.html">quintessential public forums</a>” like public streets, parks, and sidewalks, they would impose even greater constraints on the companies’ ability to regulate. Because the government is generally prohibited from discriminating against speech because of its content when it regulates the traditional public sphere, the extension of these duties to the social media companies would prevent them from being able to engage in the content-based acts of filtering, recommending, and ranking speech that play such an important role at present in organizing the digital public sphere.</p>



<p>It is not difficult, therefore, to understand why even enthusiastic advocates of free speech were unwilling to argue that the social media companies should be subjected to those rules. Doing so appeared very likely to make the platforms, as Jack Balkin <a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/free-speech-is-a-triangle/">put it</a>, “far less valuable to end users, if not wholly ungovernable,” and no one wanted that.</p>



<p>The result was nevertheless to lead most scholars and litigators to agree that the most important legal guarantee of freedom of speech in the United States provided no protection whatsoever against what the ACLU rightly <a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1347734205430591490">described</a> as the “unchecked power” of the social media companies “to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable to the speech of billions.” And not only that.</p>



<p>In recent years, the Court has interpreted the First Amendment not only to not prohibit private acts of speech discrimination but also to actively protect the right of private actors to discriminate free from <em>legislative</em> control. So in concluding that the social media companies were private actors, those who weighed in on the Great Deplatforming at least implicitly endorsed a view of the First Amendment that could be used to render those companies immune not only from judicial checks on their decisionmaking, but from legislative checks as well. The ACLU’s public statement certainly appeared to recognize as much. After warning darkly of the great power that the social media companies possessed, the statement identified voluntary transparency as the only mechanism for checking that power—the ACLU said it could only “hope that these companies will apply their rules transparently to everyone.”</p>



<p>We think it is an impoverished view of freedom of speech that leaves such weak means for protecting the expressive and democratic freedom of so many people. The Great Deplatforming may have illuminated many other things, but one thing it clearly spotlighted is how poorly equipped contemporary First Amendment doctrine is for conceptualizing, let alone doing anything about, the threats to freedom of speech that result from private control of the mass public sphere. Because virtually every forum of mass communication in the United States is privately owned and controlled, the First Amendment today sharply limits the ability of the democratic government to oversee the operation of its most important forums.</p>



<p>We do not want to have to choose between John Roberts and Mark Zuckerberg as the guardians of democracy, though that is what current doctrine seems to require. Luckily, the contemporary framework is not the only one available to us.</p>



<h2>A Spectrum of Public Duties</h2>



<p>If we look to an earlier epoch of First Amendment jurisprudence—the era of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s—what we find is a far less formalistic approach to the delimitation of the First Amendment’s boundaries, one that is much more attentive to the problem of private power than the current framework tends to be, and far less antagonistic to the possibility of democratic supervision of the mass public sphere. This is a model that would better equip courts, lawyers and legislatures to think through the difficult free speech questions raised by events like the Great Deplatforming.</p>



<p>To get a sense of how this earlier approach operated, one need only look at one of the most famous but also perhaps most misunderstood cases in the First Amendment canon—the 1946 <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/326/501">decision</a> in <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em>. <em>Marsh</em> is almost always misremembered today as a decision that held that private corporations can be considered state actors when they perform a traditional government function, like running a town. But that is not what <em>Marsh </em>held. Neither the majority nor the dissent ever suggested the possibility that the corporation involved in the case—the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation—was a state actor. (Gulf wasn’t in fact a party to the case.) All nine members of the Court instead agreed that the relevant state actors were the three Alabama state courts that either convicted or affirmed the trespass conviction of a Jehovah’s Witness who Gulf tried to kick out of the town it owned because it disliked her religious proselytizing but who refused to leave. The <em>Marsh </em>majority reversed the trespass conviction because it concluded that otherwise the corporation could use state property law to dictate what views could be expressed in the town’s public spaces, thus denying the town’s residents of a full opportunity to exercise their First Amendment rights.</p>



<p>The <em>Marsh </em>Court concluded, in other words, that a private corporation—a private actor!—had a duty to respect the free speech interests of other private persons because of the role it played in the regulation of the public sphere. More specifically, the Court held that the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation had a duty to make sure the channels of communication in its town remained open because it had voluntarily, and for its own profit, turned its property into a part of the public realm. This was because, the Court noted, “[w]hether a corporation or a municipality owns or possesses the town, the public . . . &nbsp;has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free.” It followed from this that “the managers appointed by the corporation [could not] curtail the liberty of press and religion of these people” any more than the government could.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Private actors who open up their property more, and thereby acquire more of the attributes of government control, have a concomitantly greater responsibility to honor the statutory and constitutional interests of the public who use …</p></blockquote></figure></div></article></div>

<p>Myrtle called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035254/http://myrtlehocklemeier.blogspot.com/2008/07/article-that-launched-thousand-posts.html">The article that launched a thousand posts…</a>, and counting comments on <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">this</a> <a href="http://rationalmathed.blogspot.com/2008/07/devlin-on-multiplication-or-what-is.html">and</a> <a href="http://www.textsavvyblog.net/2008/07/devlins-right-angle-finale.html">several</a> <a href="http://vlorbik.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/be-fruitful/">other</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/07/teaching_multiplication_is_it.php">blogs</a>, that may not be too much of an exaggeration. Yet the discussion feels incomplete — I have not been able to put into words all that I want to say. Thus, at the risk of once again revealing my <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/01/31/confession-i-am-not-good-at-math/">mathematical ignorance</a>, I am going to try another response to Keith Devlin’s <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_06_08.html">multiplication</a> <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_0708_08.html">articles</a>.</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I speak as a teacher, not as a mathematician. I am not qualified, nor do I intend, to argue about the implications of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeanosAxioms.html">Peano’s Axioms</a>. My experience lies primarily in teaching K-10, from elementary arithmetic through basic algebra and geometry. I remember only snippets of my college math classes, back in the days when we worried more about nuclear winter than global warming.</p>
<p>I will start with a few things we can all agree on…</p>

<h2>We All Agree on Some Things</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary students will use addition</strong> to solve beginning multiplication problems. What else could they do? They have not yet learned multiplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The multiplication table is initially built by repeated addition</strong>, as our students add up (or count by) the numbers in each row and column. Even adults, when they get stumped by a math fact they’ve forgotten, will use repeated addition to figure out the answer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeated addition does give the correct answer</strong> for any multiplication of whole numbers. Sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth — who wants to add up 957×842? But by using the Distributive Property, any multiplication of whole numbers can be reduced to a repeated addition calculation:<br>
4 ×&nbsp;3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ×&nbsp;3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rational number multiplications can be calculated as addition of parts.</strong> This is how the Egyptian scribes handled multiplication of fractions. But be careful! To calculate the parts, one needs multiplication — or rather, its inverse, division. So to use this as a definition, one must resort to circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally, I think we can all agree that repeated addition is an important problem-solving tool.</strong> Repeated addition can help students think their way through simple multiplication word problems. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it is the quickest way to understand a situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So What’s the Problem?</h2>
<p>So what is wrong with the definition, “Multiplication is repeated addition”? Perhaps <em>wrong</em> is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep, theoretical sense, the statement is true, at least for the whole numbers — I’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians. (See, for instance, <a href="http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-multiplication-is-really-defined-in.html" title="How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic">How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic</a>.) But speaking as a teacher, the phrase can definitely be misleading.</p>
<blockquote><p>To define multiplication as repeated addition is to make multiplication a sub-species of addition.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is as if there were two types of addition: regular, random, “wild” addition and the specially-bred variety of addition to which we give the name <em>multiplication</em>. Is that really how we want our students to think? Multiplication is not a mere sub-species of addition. Multiplication is its own animal, an independent operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation of addition has its <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/identity-element">identity element</a>. </li>
<li>The operation of multiplication has its <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56032.html">identity element</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Every number has its own <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/a/additive_inverse_number.htm">additive inverse</a>. </li>
<li>Each number has a <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/m/multiplicative_inverse_of_a_number.htm">multiplicative inverse</a>, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Addition has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34bx2.htm">subtraction</a>.</li>
<li>Multiplication has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34cx2.htm">division</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same, because the operations are not the same.</p>
<p>[Sidetrack: Oops! I forgot that zero does not have a multiplicative inverse. <a href="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7002833&amp;tstart=0">Jonathan</a> pointed out my mistake.]</p>
<p>[Another side note: I find it interesting that repeated subtraction can be a useful tool in solving some division problems, just as repeated addition can be a useful tool in understanding multiplication. Subtraction plays an important role in the <a href="https://denisegaskins.com/2010/04/12/the-cookie-factory-guide-to-long-division/">algorithm for long division</a>. I suppose someone will argue that this is evidence multiplication is repeated addition after all.]</p>
<h2>Dimensional Reasoning</h2>
<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Dimensional+analysis">Dimensional analysis</a> means looking at the dimensions (units of measurement) of a quantity to help you solve a science or engineering problem.</p>
<p><strong>Addition requires identical units.</strong> The sum must always have the same units as the addends:</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges = ?? </p>
<p>What does that second equation give you? Fruit salad? In order to add quantities with unlike units, we need to find a <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/common+denominator">common denominator</a>. Apples and oranges are both pieces of fruit, so…</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges =</p>
<p>2 pieces of fruit + 3 pieces of fruit = 5 pieces of fruit </p>
<p><strong>Multiplication requires different units.</strong> The product does not have the same units as either the multiplier or the multiplicand.</p>
<p>2 baskets ×&nbsp;3 apples per basket  = 6 apples </p>
<p>How can we make multiplication come out the same as repeated addition? The only way to do it is to change the units.</p>
<p>3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm </p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>2 cm ×&nbsp;3 cm = 6 cm<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>We need…</p>
<p>2 lengths ×&nbsp;3 cm per length = 6 cm</p>
<p>We do not normally think about dimensional analysis when we work with plain numbers in math class. But the fact remains that <em>multiplication changes things in a way that addition does not</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Addition is one-dimensional, but multiplication is multi-dimensional.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why the rules for fraction addition and fraction multiplication are so different. When you add positive rational numbers, you always get a sum that is bigger than either addend. But when you multiply rational numbers, all bets are off — the product may be bigger, smaller, or somewhere in between the numbers.</p>
<h2>Language Does Matter</h2>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> addend + addend = sum. The addends are interchangeable. This is represented by the fact that they have the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> multiplier ×&nbsp;multiplicand = product. The multiplier and multiplicand have different names, even though many of us have trouble remembering which is which. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiplier</strong> = “how many or how much”</li>
<li><strong>multiplicand</strong> = the size of the “unit” or “group”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Different names indicate a difference in function.</em> The multiplier and the multiplicand are not conceptually interchangeable. It is true that multiplication is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Commutative.html">commutative</a>, but (2&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;3&nbsp;chairs/row) is not the same as (3&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;2&nbsp;chairs/row), even though both sets contain 6&nbsp;chairs.</p>
<h2>A New Type of Number</h2>
<p>In multiplication, we introduce a totally new type of number: the <em>multiplicand.</em> A strange, new concept sits at the heart of multiplication, something students have never seen before.</p>
<p>The multiplicand is a this-per-that ratio.</p>
<p>A ratio is a not a counting number, but something new, much more abstract than anything the students have seen up to this point. </p>
<p>A ratio is a relationship number.</p>
<p>In addition and subtraction, numbers count how much stuff you have. If you get more stuff, the numbers get bigger. If you lose some of the stuff, the numbers get smaller. Numbers measure the amount of cookies, horses, dollars, gasoline, or whatever.</p>
<p>The multiplicand doesn’t count the number of dollars or measure the volume of gasoline. It tells the relationship between them, the dollars per gallon, which <em>stays the same whether you buy a lot or a little.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>By telling our students that “multiplication is repeated addition,” we dismiss the importance of the multiplicand. But until our students wrestle with and come to understand the concept of ratio, they can never fully understand multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How Then Shall We Teach?</h2>
<p>If we accept this argument, if we agree to no longer define basic multiplication as repeated addition, then what? How does that affect the way we teach?</p>
<p>Mainly, we need to change our focus from <strong>how</strong> to <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p>We can teach multiplication in much the same way that we do now, using manipulatives arranged in groups or rows, pictures of multiplication situations, and rectangular arrays of dots or blocks. But instead of drawing our student’s attention to the <em>process</em> of adding up the answer, we want to focus on the fact that the items are arranged in <em>equal sized groups</em>. </p>
<p>In other words, we teach our students to recognize the multiplicand: </p>
<ul>
<li>Teach children the useful word “per” and how to recognize a “this per that” unit. </li>
<li>Have them label the quantities in their workbook: 3 cookies per student, 5 flowers per vase, 1 eye per alien, or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need a simple, elementary-level catchphrase to replace “multiplication is repeated addition,” how about this? </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Multiplication is counting by this-per-that groups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As with any such phrase, this statement fails to capture all that multiplication entails. The definition will have to be expanded as students learn about rational numbers. “Oh, look! We can count just part of a group, and we can measure with a unit that is not a whole number.” Our students will someday have to learn about real numbers, complex numbers, and matrix multiplication. Even so, the phrase captures an important aspect of many multiplication situations our students will meet in K-12: that there is a multiplicand, some “this per that” quantity.</p>
<p>This approach should be especially helpful to those frustrating students — you know, the ones with the blank stare — who read a word problem and then ask, “Do I add or multiply?”</p>
<h2>A Useful Tool</h2>
<p>Completing the circle, I come back to the point of <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">my first “repeated addition” post</a>. I would like you to consider the teaching power of bar model diagrams to represent arithmetic operations. These diagrams are used in the <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm">Singapore Primary Math</a> books, and according to <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/09/02/pre-algebra-problem-solving-2nd-grade/#comment-12305">one commenter</a> they are popular in Russia and Australia. They are even beginning to show up in newer American textbooks, where they are sometimes called “tape diagrams.” </p>
<p>Here are some advantages of the bar diagram model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar diagrams chunkify the number line and make number relationships less abstract. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They provide elementary students with a pictorial algebra that can help them think through complicated word problems. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is easy for students to see the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction, or between multiplication and division. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because …</li></ul></div></div>

March 3, 2021 | https://sammorrowdrums.com/going-ad-free-with-micropayments | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sammorrowdrums.com/going-ad-free-with-micropayments">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having recently decided that I was fed up with seeing ads and paywalls on countless websites every time I open links (on news sites in particular), while still wanting content producers to get payed, I felt I needed to look into options for micropayments and see if they are any good. I simply won't subscribe to sites for which I am only a casual reader, so I needed another option.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dMP9PflY.png" alt="Scroll payment breakdown"></p>

<p>There are actually now several micropayment providers, and Mozilla seem to be very motivated to help push the field forwards<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/03/web-monetization-coil-and-firefox-reality/" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="https://firstlook.firefox.com/betterweb/" rel="nofollow">2</a>. Interestingly JavaScript pioneer and Mozilla co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" rel="nofollow">Brendan Eich</a>, is also one of the pioneers of micropayment systems with <a href="https://brave.com/" rel="nofollow">Brave web browser</a> and their <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/" rel="nofollow">Basic Attention Token</a> system. Unfortunately, I ruled out Brave early on because:</p>
<ul><li>There are numerous accusations of dubious activity such as:
<ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology" rel="nofollow">Inserting affiliate links</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/brave-software-publishers-respond/" rel="nofollow">They tried blocking ads, but then injecting their own</a>
<ul><li><strong>UPDATE</strong> Apparently this is a widely held misconception, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18744481" rel="nofollow">here</a> is some more conversation around it.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18734999" rel="nofollow">Taking tips for people without consent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/brave-browser-leak-exposed-user-domain-info-months" rel="nofollow">Including Tor, but Leaking DNS</a>, which is now fixed but a false sense of security is a dangerous thing</li></ul></li>
<li>I'm not convinced by Basic Attention Token and tips implementation, nor chances of mass adoption of Brave for their system to get enough market share to succeed.</li>
<li>I want to choose what browser I use – and still be able to read monetized content without ads.</li></ul>

<p>So that left me mostly with the two services Mozilla is working with, <a href="https://coil.com/" rel="nofollow">Coil</a> and <a href="https://scroll.com/" rel="nofollow">Scroll</a>. Here is a basic breakdown:</p>
<ul><li>Coil
<ul><li>$5/month</li>
<li>Works with browser plugins</li>
<li>Pays out continuously based on time spent on site / watching content</li>
<li>On mobile requires <a href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/" rel="nofollow">Puma browser</a> (due to lack of plugin integration in mobile browsers), which is basically Firefox Mobile + Coil support</li>
<li>Uses open <a href="https://interledger.org/" rel="nofollow">interledger</a> protocol:
<ul><li>To monetize your own content, just add an HTML tag (or if doing conditional ads, you can do a small bit of JS to check).</li>
<li>Paying out goes to any wallet provider that supports the protocol, I use <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="nofollow">Uphold</a> for my blog, which can pay out in Fiat currency</li>
<li>Other providers than coil can emerge and use the same protocol</li></ul></li>
<li>Enables various other kinds of Monetization, so can be used with Twitch, Imgur, Newgrounds and all kinds of other services.</li>
<li>Coil doesn't have to pre-approve monetized content providers</li></ul></li>
<li>Scroll
<ul><li>$5/month</li>
<li>Works with browser cookie as far as I can tell</li>
<li>Pays out to its partners as a split share of your subscription fee</li>
<li>Works on basically all browsers (but you might not notice if you get signed out at first, from clearing cache for example)</li>
<li>Does deals with specific content providers, such as The Atlantic and Bloomberg.</li>
<li>Centralised payment system, officially only available in USA currently
</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2 id="using-coil">Using Coil</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/HBt9YM2z.png" alt="Coil Homepage"></p>

<p>Coil was very easy to set up. Just sign-up,  grab the browser extensions and go. Then you can see a little green dollar sign when you visit pages that take payments. Unfortunately we don't have the ability (yet) to add the extension to mobile browsers, so in order to benefit from Coil on mobile I needed to install Puma Browser (effectively Firefox Mobile). Which, after a while of delaying I eventually decided to do. My one gripe was that neither LastPass nor 1Password currently recognize it as a browser, so it couldn't fully replace my mobile browser (yet), as they would offer to add passwords for the entire app rather than just the page you were on  – I did flag this with 1Password.</p>

<p>I am very happy with the service Coil provides (including their <a href="https://coil.com/explore" rel="nofollow">curated list</a> of monetized sites). I find that the broad range of independent publishers it supports makes it an incredibly viable option. The open protocol in particular should enable future iterations, competitors and support from more financial institutions over time, and it seems like its biggest perk is it is decentralized, and so I was able to experiment with the other side of the coin with ease.</p>

<p>With my blogging provider <a href="https://write.as/" rel="nofollow">Write.As</a>, I was able to instantly try out monetizing my own content. I just needed to add my “interledger payment pointer”, which I obtained via <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="nofollow">Uphold</a> to automatically pay out in Euros.</p>

<p>Now, before getting excited, my low volume blog does not make any real money. Here's how it's gone so far:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/GsnyTHdQ.png" alt="My uphold wallet balance"></p>

<p>But, I am hopeful should I write anything of consequence and should more people start using Coil, I would end up getting payed a much greater amount. I'd be interested to see how the more commercial partners are doing.</p>



<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/eSKZyL15.png" alt="Scroll Homepage"></p>

<p>So after my positive experience with Coil, I decided to give Scroll a go. It is interesting, because while it doesn't have the open tech appeal of Coil, it does remove ads and has some serious premium content providers signed up to it, although sadly some of them still have article limits before you would still have to subscribe.</p>

<p>Coil uses magic SSO links via their interface and to your email, so it is really simple to get going. Click on the links in your browsers of choice, and you are already set up. They also show a breakdown of which partners are getting a cut of your subscription (and how much of it they get).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dMP9PflY.png" alt="Scroll payment breakdown"></p>

<p>You can tell that it is working on participating sites because you get a small S symbol on-screen, which you can open to the Scroll toolbar, which enables you to do things such as share ad free links, and also it gives visual confirmation that you are indeed signed in.</p>

<p>My only problem (other than questions about the centralized model), is that Scroll gets logged out when you clear your browser cache etc. and I don't know what their plan is (and if it will continue to work the same way once browsers crack down further on cookies). So I have found myself logged out a few times, and then need to input my email and get a link to back log in again. It's only a mild annoyance, but it is true that it has been more awkward to use in the long run compared to Coil (which was more a set up once, work forever kind of thing).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think the world of micropayment funded content is finally beginning to mature, and “experiments” in the field are getting more and more thought out, and I expect to see these services continue to expand significantly  over the next few years. I cannot predict if the day of micropayments is here, and I know that globally $5/month to two main providers is cheap in some places, and unimaginable in others, but the nice part with Coil, is that people in places that are less wealthy can easily get set up to monetize content, and hopefully that will democratize media a little bit more – while also providing alternatives to established ad-based media.</p>

<p>There are also further questions to be asked, like the implications of society being desensitized to automatically paying out small sums of money all the time, and potential for accidentally paying money to people you wouldn't want to (even if there were ads doing it before anyway). It is also interesting what impact this has on privacy / tracking – and micropayment providers knowing what content you are looking at. I certainly hope that none of these businesses evolve to monetize your user data, as that is exactly the opposite of what I'm paying them to do. I also wonder about children and people unable to pay, and if we are just locking them out of ad-free experiences – which I would consider to be a dark outcome. Will it also make ad-funded stuff less viable – as more places stop relying on ads and use this instead? I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>I am very happy with my micropayment experience so far, and I intend to continue to use both Scroll and Coil for at least the next year, and I definitely feel a bit better not seeing ads this way, rather than simply applying an ad-blocker with no alternative funding for content producers. If you are willing to, I'd recommend giving it a try for yourself and experiencing the warm feeling of giving something back when reading something you have enjoyed, without the cursed tracking cookies and ads slowing loading and interrupting your experience.</p>

<p>
This article helps to understand and implement BRDFs commonly used in game engines, for use in both rasterization and 
emerging realtime raytracing. I hope it will help to overcome the steep learning curve of this complex topic, and to 
understand how to render different materials. Various optimizations and approximations are discussed, and code is 
shown for all relevant parts. Accompanying source code is a single file which can be compiled for both C++ and HLSL, 
and can be easily integrated into rendering applications.

            <div><p><strong>In the education sector, personal and other privacy-sensitive data are digitally stored and exchanged at an increasing rate. It is important this is done in a safe and responsible manner. An investigation commissioned by the University of Groningen (RUG) and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA) has shown there are privacy risks associated with the use of Google’s G Suite*.</strong></p>
<p>These risks are associated with the so-called metadata Google collects. SURF and SIVON have supported this investigation into privacy risks and are currently, on behalf of the education sector, in negotiations with Google to ensure these privacy risks are eliminated.</p>
</div>
      
  </div>
  </div><div>
          
            <div><p>The privacy risks were revealed by a so-called Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) on Google’s G Suite. A DPIA provides insights into the way data is collected, what is done with it, and what risks are associated with collection. The Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security had the DPIA carried out for the G Suite Enterprise version, the RUG and HvA had an investigation carried out on G Suite Education.</p>
<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>Google collects metadata, for example, about the use of Google G Suite. With this data, Google can see what users click on most often, how long they are logged in for, what internet pages are used most, and what search queries are carried out most. This is, therefore, not a case of individual learning results or user’s address data.</p>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>Google regards itself a data controller rather than a processor. This means Google considers itself entitled to determine the purpose of the collection of metadata and the manner in which this is done. Moreover, Google states in their privacy agreements that they may unilaterally change the conditions surrounding the collection of metadata, without asking for [users’] permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For applications in educational institutions, we find it undesirable that the ownership and responsibility for this data lies with Google. As a result, educational institutions using Google G Suite have little to no control over what happens with their data, creating a potential risk for the future. For example, if this metadata is being used to place personalised advertising.</p>
<h2>Follow-up steps</h2>
<p>Currently, there is no agreement with Google in place surrounding the practices on collecting metadata and we are still discussing the indicated improvement points with them. We will also be submitting a request for advice about these privacy risks to the Dutch Data Protection Authority. We assume Google will make changes so the identified risks will be removed and education institutions can continue to use G Suite for Education safely.</p>
<p><em>* G Suite for Education was recently renamed Google Workspace for Education. Google Workspace for Education includes Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and more.</em></p>
</div>
      
      </div><div>
      <p><span>What products does Google G Suite for Education contain and what is Google Workspace for Education?</span></p><div>
            <div><p>Google G Suite for Education includes: Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and more. Google G Suite for Education has &nbsp;recently been renamed Google Workspace for Education.</p>
<p>The complete list of applications: Google Classroom, Chat, Meet, Hangouts, Contacts, Tasks, Keep, Drive, Calendar, Jamboard, Sites, Forms, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Assignments, Cloud search and retrieval across services, Vault, Gmail, Cloud identity management</p>
</div>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What is a DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>A DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) provides insights into the way data is collected, what is done with it, and what risks are associated with collection. When a DPIA is completed, measures can be put in place to reduce the risks.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Why has a DPIA of Google G Suite been done?</span></p><div>
            <p>The DPIA was carried out in order to identify potential privacy risks of Google G Suite for Education when used by educational institutions. With the outcomes of the DPIA, we were able determine what measures need to be taken to limit those risks.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What are the outcomes of the DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>The outcome of the DPIAs has shown there are privacy risks associated with the use of Google G Suite (Enterprise) for Education. Google has therefore amended their privacy conditions on a number of points. However, risks still remain in place. The DPIA also has shown that so-called ‘metadata’ is collected. Metadata remotely measures whether and how users use applications. This data is sent to the supplier of the software and for example, concerns the moment of login by users, what internet pages are visited, how long a document is being worked on, or how many words are being typed. Google still regards itself a controller of some of the data collected, rather than a processor. This means Google considers itself entitled to determine the purpose of the collection of metadata, as well as the manner in which this is done. Moreover, Google is not transparent about their data collection and processing practices. As a result, educational institutions using Google G Suite have little to no control over what happens with their data.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What happens next?</span></p><div>
            <p>On behalf of the education sector, SURF and SIVON are in discussion with Google to resolve the privacy risks identified regarding the use of metadata. At the moment, Google has not yet implemented all changes the education sector requires. SURF and SIVON will submit a request for advice to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP). The AP is expected to deliver an assessment of the privacy risks identified.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What happens if Google does not  resolve the privacy risks?</span></p><div>
            <p>We assume Google will make changes so the identified risks will be resolved.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Should educational institutions stop using Google immediately? </span></p><div>
            <div><p>No, we believe there is a problem that needs to and can be solved. We assume Google will make the necessary adjustments. The current situation does not mean that schools and educational institutions should stop using Google G Suite at once, especially if they depend on it for the continuity of their education. The discussions with Google regarding changes to their policy are ongoing and the Dutch Data Protection Authority has also been asked to issue an advice.</p>
<p>We advise institutions that are currently considering implementing the use Google, to temporarily halt these plans until further notice.</p>
</div>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What changes has Google made as a result of the DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>It has been agreed with Google that they will communicate more clearly about the use of user data, including about the processing of metadata they collect. When using G Suite for Education, Google will put in place measures for logging in with a private account in the institutional environment, so personal information and institutional information are not mixed. Users will also be able to block access to "additional services", such as YouTube, for their institutional account.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>How do I know whether my institution has purchased the Google G Suite for education service via SURF?</span></p><div>
            <p>SURF has not had an agreement with Google for years. Only since very recently, there is the possibility to purchase G Suite via OCRE. Institutions have not yet made use of this option.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>If my institution still has a direct contract with Google for this service, can SURF take over this contract and ensure  the DPIA requirements are met?</span></p><div>
            <p>That depends on your institution's current agreements with Google. We are not in a position to make general assumptions about individual situations. Please contact your SURF relationship manager if you have any questions.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What is the impact of the DPIA on other Google services currently on offer through OCRE?</span></p><div>
            <p>The DPIA that is completed, was specifically aimed at G Suite. Other Google solutions have not been tested at this point. As such, we cannot (yet) state with certainty whether these solutions comply or not. It is up to the institution to weigh up the pros and cons of their use and, above all, to consult their Data Protection Officer (FG). We do advise to proceed with caution when entering into new contracts.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Within my institution we cannot simply switch to another service; what does SURF advise for these  situations?</span></p><div>
            <p>Currently, there is a problem that needs to be solved, and we assume Google will make the necessary adjustments to resolved these problems. The current situation does not mean the education sector should stop using Google G Suite immediately or all together, especially if they depend on it for the continuity of their education. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) has been asked to provide advice on this, and talks with Google about their policy are ongoing. We advise institutions considering using Google to take the results of this DPIA into account when making decisions.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Do these privacy risks also apply to Microsoft/O365?</span></p><div>
            <p>Similar DPIAs have been&nbsp; carried out for Microsoft products and services two years ago. As a result, at the time, additional arrangements have been made with Microsoft. The final conclusion of these DPIAs was that the use of Microsoft products does not involve high risks, provided that the customer takes a number of measures.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>I have a question or comment I do not wish to discuss publicly. Who should I contact?</span></p><div>
            <p>If your question is not answered on this page, please contact your SURF relationship manager.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>SURF does not offer a contract with Google. Why is SURF involved in this?</span></p><div>
            <p>At the request of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA) and the University of Groningen (RUG), SURF has been involved in this process since May 2020. SURF has been involved as this matter is of …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>A Kilo Byte-Sized LISP System</h2>

<p><a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/klisp.tgz">klisp.tgz</a> (35KB, KL21) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/klisp.txt.html">klisp.txt</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/kl.exe">kl.exe</a> (DOS, 14KB) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/kl.com">kl.com</a> (DOS, 13KB) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/22/index.html">KLISP&nbsp;22</a>
</p>

<p>Kilo&nbsp;LISP is a small interpreter for purely
symbolic LISP. Its source consists of 25K bytes of comprehensible
code (20KB C, 5KB LISP) and it runs in 64K bytes
of memory. There is also a
<a href="http://t3x.org/cpnc/index.html#klisp">version for CP/M</a>
that is written in
T3X and runs in 48K bytes of memory. Then there is a slightly
larger and <a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/22/index.html">more Common LISP-compatible
version</a> that needs 80K bytes of RAM. Despite its small size Kilo
LISP offers:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>lexical scoping
 </li><li>tail call elimination
 </li><li>macros
 </li><li>quasiquotation
 </li><li>variable-argument functions
 </li><li>constant-space garbage collection
 </li><li>image files
 </li><li>keyboard interrupt handling
</li></ul>

<p>The code should compile with any C89 (K&amp;R2/ANSI/ISO) C compiler.
It even compiles with Turbo C 2.0 or <a href="http://t3x.org/subc/">SubC</a>
and with K&amp;R (pre-ANSI) C when using
<a href="http://t3x.org/index.html#unproto">unproto</a>. The CP/M version requires
<a href="http://t3x.org/t3x/index.html#Z">T3X/Z</a> version 13 or later. The interpreter
does not use any stdio functions and compiles to a static executable of
</p>

<ul>
 <li>29K&nbsp;bytes using SubC on FreeBSD x86-64
 </li><li>31K&nbsp;bytes using T3X/Z on CP/M (Z80)
 </li><li>13K&nbsp;bytes using Turbo C on DOS (8086)
 </li><li>11K&nbsp;bytes using Mark Williams C on Coherent (80286)
 </li><li>512K&nbsp;bytes using GCC on FreeBSD x86-64 (LOL)
</li></ul>

<p>Language-wise, Kilo&nbsp;LISP is a LISP-1 using tail recursion to
implement iteration. It is a bit like Scheme, but using more
LISPy syntax and function names. See the <a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/klisp.txt.html">manual</a>
for details.</p>

<p>Since some of you have discovered
<a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/nils-m-holm/the-kilo-lisp-system/hardcover/product-1wk5vvw6.html">the book</a>: it is a retro-style, overpriced hardcover
edition for my own personal amusement only and contains nothing that cannot be
found on this page!

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/what-was-observability-again/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Cristian Klein, Sr Cloud Architect at </em>Elastisys</p>



<p><strong>Imagine running a business without financial projections or even knowing how much money is left in the bank. How would you know if you are swimming in a huge cash buffer or if you need to skip a customer lunch due to insufficient funds? Without observing your financials it is simply impossible to run a healthy business. Similarly, without observing your computing infrastructure, it is impossible to keep an application running healthy.</strong></p>



<p>In fact, observability is so critical that as of February 2021, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) lists&nbsp;<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=observability-and-analysis&amp;grouping=category">102 projects in that category</a>. Observability is not only important, it is also expensive. Netflix is jokingly referred to as “a platform that produces massive amounts of logs, that happens to also stream videos”. Observability is expensive for two reasons:</p>



<ol><li>Observability needs to be&nbsp;<strong>at least one order of magnitude more reliable</strong>&nbsp;than the observed system. Otherwise, you will keep debugging your observability stack, instead of using it to keep your application running.<br></li><li>Since you never really know what to observe, until after an incident, it is common to&nbsp;<strong>observe more than you need</strong>. A good car driver not only looks ahead, but keeps scanning the surroundings to avoid an accident.</li></ol>



<p>In this post, let us dive deeper into observability: What it is, different types of observability and what it technically means to implement observability. At the end of this post, you will understand why you should resist the temptation to save a few bucks on observability.</p>



<h2>What is observability?</h2>



<p>Observability comes under many names, such as monitoring, auditing, telemetry, instrumenting. Ignoring the nuances, all these words essentially mean the same: Taking measurements of your infrastructure, platform and application to understand how it’s doing. As Peter Drucker used to say:&nbsp;“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”</p>



<p>If you are familiar with Lean Thinking — i.e., Build-Measure-Learn — then observability should come naturally to you. Observability closes the feedback loop via the “measure” phase. It allows your team to make rapid changes to an application, quickly adapt to its user base and environment, without unnecessary surprises. Good observability can convert “being woken up at 2am” into a mundane daily check.</p>



<h2>But what is observability, really?</h2>



<p>When talking about observability, we generally try to answer three questions:</p>



<ol><li>Are my users happy?</li><li>Are my applications happy?</li><li>Are my servers happy?</li></ol>



<p>We do this via three means: traces, logs and metrics. The former produce more data, but not necessarily more insight.&nbsp; Nowadays, each of these is expected to be near-real-time. (Would you be okay with a heart rate monitor that tells you yesterday’s heart rate?)</p>



<p>Let us go through logging and metrics, the two you should definitely have.</p>



<h2>Logging</h2>



<figure><img src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logging-1024x576.png?x26421" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot of Kibana, which, together with Elasticsearch, is a leading logging solution.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While writing an application, your team will often add code for “logging”. These are explicit instructions to produce a log line, i.e., a bunch of meaningful text, when code execution passes through a major event. For example, “user X logged in” or “user Y authentication failure”, etc. These lines are what makes the difference between asking your customers “if they tried clearing their browser cache and reload” or actually investigating their complaint.</p>



<p>Logging is rather&nbsp;<strong>explicit</strong>: Your team needs to add logging code and needs to foresee what to log. The rule of thumb is that all major boundary events need to be logged. Some application bugs only manifest in production, so you should rather “over-log” than “under-log”. Otherwise, a lot of time is wasted hunting so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">Heisenbugs</a>: bugs that are extremely difficult to reproduce, but nevertheless cause customer annoyance.</p>



<p>Logging produces&nbsp;<strong>massive amounts of data</strong>. To save costs, it’s best to think in terms of short-term and long-term logs. Short-term logs — e.g., the last 7 days — should be “googleable”, i.e., you should be able to perform a full-text search within seconds. Projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch/Kibana</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a>&nbsp;are most suitable for this purpose.</p>



<p>Long-term logs are stored in whatever form is cheapest, usually object storage. They are not immediately “googleable”, then again, the likelihood of needing to search through them is small. In fact, if you want to err on the side of privacy, it might be good to avoid long-term logs.</p>



<p>Sometimes, you do not care about the exact log line, rather about the number of times a specific event occurred. This information could be extracted from logs, but there is a more efficient way: metrics.</p>



<h2>Metrics</h2>



<figure><img src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics-1024x576.png?x26421" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot of Grafana, a leading project for visualizing metrics.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metrics — also called Service Level Indicators (SLI) or Key Performance Indicators (KPI) — are time series of numeric values. Think of it like recording outside temperature in all major cities on an hourly basis. Metrics use the<strong>&nbsp;least amount of space</strong>&nbsp;and provide (for the space they use) the&nbsp;<strong>maximum amount of insight</strong>. They can record the number of hourly active users, the number of requests hitting your application, the amount of free disk space, etc. Keeping an eye on metrics ensures that your users get a great experience with your application, while also keeping infrastructure costs down.</p>



<p>Metrics are rather&nbsp;<strong>explicit</strong>. Your team needs to add code for collecting and also exposing a given metric. However, most commonly used tools out there, such as Nginx, Kubernetes or MySQL, already export a plethora of metrics, which should provide you with a good situational awareness.</p>



<p>Projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>&nbsp;can help you collect metrics with minimal support required from the application, while&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>&nbsp;can help visualize them. In fact, I would argue that screens filled with Grafana dashboards make a nice decoration for office walls. You know, when going to the office for work becomes a thing again.</p>



<p>So far we talked about visualization, i.e., a more intentional form of observability. But what if the system needs attention here and now?</p>



<h2>Alerts</h2>



<p>Alerts are like the system “crying for help” requesting the attention of a human. Usually, if a given metric exceeds a threshold, the on-call person receives an email, an SMS, or a message on Slack or Microsoft Teams. An automatic escalation may be implemented, e.g., if the first on-call person does not respond to the alert within 30 minutes, the second on-call person is alerted.</p>



<p>Alerts are tricky. Too much alerting and the system is “crying wolf”. Your team will end up with “alert fatigue” and start ignoring even the important ones. Too little alerting and your customers will “do alerting” for you … this is usually not the preferred alerting channel, least your accountant complains about having to cash in too many invoices.</p>



<p>Therefore, the bar for “when to alert” should be high. Is this a “2am” or “mayday” event, i.e., should someone be woken up at night if this happens? Or is this a “pan-pan” event and can be dealt with during daytime?</p>



<p>Fortunately, projects like Prometheus, not only enable alerting, they can also perform predictions. Knowing that a disk will get full in 72 hours, can prevent both disappointing customers with a downtime and ruining a team member’s good night sleep.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Lack of observability is like driving with closed eyes: You can’t tell how close you are to a disaster. The faster you are driving and the busier the road, the more you should watch out.</p>



<p>Observability is the same: The faster you want your team to add features, the more you should invest in observability. And, while it may be tempting to save a few bucks on observability, those savings will quickly erode during the next slow-to-fix incident.</p>

<p>What you see above is a tool to reorder the pages of a PDF file, into the order as described by Brent Yorgey <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> (called “Möbius double-sided printing” <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>). Basically, it reorders the <i>n</i> pages [1, 2, …, <i>n</i>] of a PDF file into the order [1, <i>m</i>+1, 2, <i>m</i>+2, 3, <i>m</i>+3, … <i>m</i>, 2<i>m</i>], where <i>m</i> = ⌈<i>n</i>/2⌉, and the final page 2<i>m</i> is omitted if it doesn't exist (i.e., if <i>n</i> is odd).</p>

<p>To use this tool, just upload a PDF file above, then click on the link to download a new PDF file with reordered pages.</p>


<p><i>(In short, so that it requires less mental effort to turn pages, and so that it's easier to look at the next/previous page(s) simultaneously. It's explained by Brent Yorgey on the two pages mentioned above; reproducing part of the explanation here along with his illustrations.)</i></p>

<p>Consider the standard/default method of two-sided printing: for a document with 8 pages, the result looks like:</p>

<p>When printed out as a bunch of loose sheets, this order has two (very minor) advantages over the standard order:
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>When you're done reading a certain page, the way to proceed to the next page is the same regardless of whether you're on an odd-numbered page or an even-numbered page: you don't have to remember, and so at page boundaries you don't have to shift your attention from the contents of what you're reading to figuring out page mechanics. What you do is always the same, namely flip the current sheet of paper and move it to the bottom of the stack:</p>

    <li>When the text refers to the previous or the next page, you can always very easily look at that page or put it adjacent to the current one (so you can see both at once), which with the standard method is impossible when an odd-numbered page refers to its next page or an even-numbered page refers to its previous one. Also, if you just want to glance at the previous page, there is never any page flipping required: just twist your wrist and look at the bottom of the stack. (This is my main reason for preferring this method over the minor variant he calls “Two-way double-sided”.)</li>
  </ol>



<p>The code rearranges pages using <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">pdf-lib</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib">GitHub</a>) (v1.3.0) by Andrew Dillon. I tried to use Mozilla's PDF.js, but its documentation on these “core” matters (as opposed to just rendering a PDF in a canvas or whatever) seems poor/nonexistent compared to pdf-lib, which is excellent.</p>

<p>The idea of printing documents in this way, and the analysis and pictures above, are due to Brent Yorgey (<a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> and <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>, as mentioned).</p>

The kids, their requirements and then planning their workday around that.</p><p>But in the case of Brett, he's not just a father of 3 but the CEO of ~15 person marketing company AND launching another startup. So besides running a family, he's also responsible for running and growing a business and starting a new one too.</p><div><p>If you're thinking Brett would be struggling to manage all of those things? </p><p>I’m afraid, you're wrong.</p></div><p>That's what blew me away! Frankly, at the end of my conversation with him I felt it would actually be easy for him to manage all those things with the several concepts, principles and tools that he uses to guard and make the most of his time.</p><p>One key learning that I took away from him is how he reflects back on the tasks that he didn't accomplish by the assigned deadline. He re-analyzes if those tasks were really important enough or could they just be delegated or completely ignored. Instead of, you know, feeling guilty and crying wet tears over them. I mean that’s what I do at least. Unlike Brett, who does this whole re-analysis to help him make better time allocation decisions in future.</p><p>That's just one of the many useful techniques, concepts, tools he shared in our entire conversation. It's almost like a mini-productivity course if you read it through.</p><p>Let's dive straight in!</p><blockquote>If you like this blog post, please take a minute to share it around. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mailmanhq.com%2Fbrett-farmiloe-markitors%2F&amp;via=Mailman_HQ%20%40mohitmamoria&amp;text=Brett%20Farmiloe%20-%20CEO%20with%203%20kids%20and%202%20businesses%20to%20run%21">Click here to get an auto-populated tweet</a>.</blockquote><h3 id="brett-introduces-himself">Brett introduces himself</h3><p>Hi I’m Brett Farmiloe. Father of 3, CEO of <a href="https://markitors.com/">Markitors</a>, an SEO company for small businesses and I’m also launching a startup that’s considered a knowledge network (terkel.io). Balancing all of those things is basically what I try to do everyday.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-knowledge-network">What is a knowledge network?</h3><div><p>The knowledge network I’m building is called <a href="https://terkel.io/">Terkel</a>. Panelists can go in, answer questions from their area of expertise and get published. Sharing your knowledge is the best way to promote your small business.</p><p>It was born out of the fact that our SEO company was turning away 9 out of 10 leads as they didn’t meet certain criteria for us to develop a positive ROI for them. So we created this knowledge network where these small businesses could still participate, get value and build some brand authority for their website, so that eventually they can be a good client for us.</p></div><h3 id="how-brett-started-his-business">How Brett started his business?</h3><div><p>I started Markitors as a freelancer, had a bunch of clients. I was having a really good time, I was &nbsp;traveling around the world doing marketing and it was great. Then I got my website to rank at #1 in google search results. If you google the term “Digital marketing company” anywhere in the United States, you would find markitors.com on top, and then when you call the phone it’d just be me hangin’ out in my daughter’s bedroom. People would say, ”hey tell me about your company” and I’d go,” well it’s just me”. That inspired to actually go ahead and start a company and now we’ve got around 15 employees.</p><p>The thing that has recurred time and time again for the past decade or so is this notion that help is very hard to find in digital marketing. Small business owners have this aspiration or dream for their business and it’s very hard for entrepreneurs to realize that dream without proper help. Small business owners keep coming at me with a sense of distrust, which is valid as they might have burnt before or they’re hearing conflicting things from multiple people. They’re in a confused state, I know I need it but I have no idea what to do.</p><p>The thing that propels and motivates me with Markitors is to help small businesses make a big impact. With Markitors the goal is to create something larger than what a freelancer can and make a difference in many people’s lives. I believe small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and worldwide economy. If we can help that space by giving small businesses more clarity on how they could realize their dreams then I don’t think there can be anything better than that.</p></div><h3 id="why-his-company-is-called-markitors-">Why his company is called “Markitors”?</h3><div><p>When I graduating from college, I majored in accounting. My first job out of school was of a “Financial Auditors”, so I was auditing balance sheets and financial statements. I then transitioned over to marketing and said let’s combine marketing and auditors in one company name and hence, “Markitors”.</p><p>It was a good representation of the differentiation I was bringing to the market and on top of that, the domain was available so I just went with it.</p><p>Another thing I like about the name “Markitors”, is that the misspellings are io which is short for input-output. Since SEO is increasingly technology and data-driven, so that input-output (io) really helps position the differentiation we’re seeking.</p></div><h3 id="what-the-pandemic-has-taught-about-time-management">What the pandemic has taught about time management?</h3><div><p>For me, it’s essentially that it’s impossible to work in the mornings with kids at home until they’re off to school. Else, it’s just calling for frustration throughout the day. The first part of my day, say 6 AM to 8 AM is focused on getting the kids out of the doors so that I can focus on work.</p><p>Instead of having this balance, I prefer giving full attention and focus on 1 thing. That’s lesson number 1 for me. In the mornings it’s my kids, and then my work.</p></div><h3 id="productivity-tools-he-uses">Productivity tools he uses</h3><div><p>I use a project management tool to organize everything, for me that’s <strong>Asana</strong>.</p><p>Asana helps me plan-out and prioritize different tasks based on today feature, upcoming feature and the stuff that’s later. That helps me organize my activities based on when they need to get done.</p><p>Then I use <strong>Google Calendar</strong> for scheduling and blocking time for activities. I have mainly 2-hour blocks to get stuff done. Time-blocking on my calendar helps limit distractions and really get things done that need to be done.</p><p>I’ll also give a shoutout to <strong><a href="https://www.mailmanhq.com/">Mailman</a></strong>, it has been awesome from a limiting-distractions point of view. The way that I structure and use Mailman is I have 3 email deliveries throughout the day, morning delivery at 7 AM, the afternoon delivery at 12:30 so that I can have lunch and when I come back there are some messages to address and then I have the end of day delivery at around 4:30 PM to quickly address the things that I need to before I log off for the day.</p><p>I don’t if you’ve watched the documentary Social Dilemma. It basically talks about how people are addicted to certain technologies and I find it funny that one of my friends who I went to high school with, wasn’t addicted to social stuff but he was addicted to email. Honestly, I could sympathize with that, as I’m not very active on social but digital addiction can very well be email. Mailman has really helped me limit those distractions and stay productive.</p><p>Talking about productivity tools, another good one I use is <strong>Calendly</strong>. It has been really helpful in self-scheduling meetings and client calls, availing the continuous back and forth for finalizing a time that works for both parties.</p></div><h3 id="on-managing-a-team">On managing a team</h3><div><p>Recently, we made a key hire at Markitors, “VP of Operations “ to take care of the day to day things that keep coming up. When you’re running a marketing agency, small fires keep popping, and those need to be addressed, so having someone responsible to take care of all of that really helps the founder or CEO focus on the more important things like growing the business.</p><p>This is also a good thing for the team, as I think of myself as more like a disruptor, I like to experiment, challenge, and change things. That chaotic nature is not good for employees, who’d like to have some stability. Bringing in someone to take care of operations has ensured that, while I get to dabble more in creative work, taking the business forward and in the direction we want to go in.</p></div><blockquote>If you like this blog post, please take a minute to share it around. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mailmanhq.com%2Fbrett-farmiloe-markitors%2F&amp;via=Mailman_HQ%20%40mohitmamoria&amp;text=Brett%20Farmiloe%20-%20CEO%20with%203%20kids%20and%202%20businesses%20to%20run%21">Click here to get an auto-populated tweet</a>.</blockquote><h3 id="team-productivity-by-wins-">Team productivity by “wins”</h3><p>Every morning at 8:30 we have a team meeting where we all discuss our “wins” from the previous day and 1 priority for the day, then everyone goes their own ways and we hold each other accountable to accomplish that 1 thing.</p><h3 id="on-burnout">On burnout</h3><div><p>I think if any entrepreneur would be lying if they say they’ve never been burnt out or close to burnout.

<p>Fasting is the process by which someone holds off eating for a certain amount of time. Based on <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/intermittent-fasting-it-right-for-you">University of Michigan Health Lab</a>, intermittent fasting is beneficial for weight loss and may help improve blood pressure, reduce liver fat, and lower cholesterol[1].</p>



<p>If you’re considering intermittent fasting, you must be quite confident to resist your craving for food in the morning, at noon, or even in the evening.</p>



<p>What about your craving for coffee?</p>



<p>This article tells you everything you need to know about coffee and intermittent fasting.</p>



<h3>Can I Drink Coffee While Intermittent Fasting?</h3>



<p>The short answer is YES.</p>



<p>The long answer is you can drink coffee during intermittent fasting because it may bolster the benefits of fasting.</p>



<h4><strong>Inflammation Reduction</strong></h4>



<p>Chronic inflammation is the cause root of many diseases. Based on the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28967799/">research published by PubMed</a>[2], intermittent fasting and coffee intake are beneficial to reduce inflammation.</p>



<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27842207/">Some research</a>[3] indicates higher coffee intake may help reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome that is a type of inflammation featuring high blood pressure, fat excess, high cholesterol and high blood sugar.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590460/">research</a>[4] indicating that coffee intake may decrease the risk of Type 2 Diabetes. In addition, daily up to 3 cups (710 ml) of coffee may lead to a 19% reduced risk of death from heart disease.</p>



<h4><strong>Good for Your Brain Health</strong></h4>



<p>One of the reasons why intermittent fasting becomes increasingly popular is that intermittent fasting may promote brain health and protect against nervous system disease related with age.</p>



<p>Fortunately, coffee features such advantages as well.</p>



<p>Similar with intermittent fasting, regular coffee intake may reduce the risk of mental decline, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson.</p>



<p>Under the condition of intermittent fasting, your body will generate energy from ketone fat, which is related with brain health improvement. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177691/">The earlier research</a>[5] indicated that the caffeine in the coffee equivalently promotes the generation of ketone.</p>



<p>Moreover, intermittent fasting may improve brain health by increasing autophagy that is the process of getting rid of cells that are damaged or dysfunctional. Autophagy may protect against mental decline correlated with age.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24769862/">a research in mice</a>[6] indicates that coffee intake can promote the generation of autophagy.</p>



<p>Therefore, coffee intake during intermittent fasting may be quite beneficial to your health and coffee can’t break your fasting.</p>



<figure><amp-img width="1200" height="628" src="https://www.fastyle.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coffee-fasting.png" alt="coffee fasting" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="628" src="https://www.fastyle.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coffee-fasting.png" alt="coffee fasting" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzYyOCcgd2lkdGg9JzEyMDAnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img></figure>



<h3>Are All Types of Coffee Fit for Intermittent Fasting?</h3>



<p>Definitely NO.</p>



<p>You can drink coffee while fasting. However, maybe not the coffee you are used to. Not want to break your fasting, black coffee is recommended.</p>



<p>Coffee nowadays has changed to more of a dessert beverage that is packed with calories. As one of the main benefits of intermittent fasting is weight loss, the coffee containing cream, sugar, or any type of sweetener should be avoided. Sugar is a monster that will quickly increase your blood sugar level. Therefore, sugar should be avoided being added to your coffee if you are fasting to lose weight.</p>



<p>In addition, coffee is beneficial during fasting as it provides caffeine and will have you up and moving with energy even when you are feeling sluggish because of the lack of food. Caffeine is also the world’s most widely used nootropic (smart drug). So, drinking coffee during fasting will ensure that your mind is still working properly as well.</p>



<h3>Does Coffee Stop Autophagy?</h3>



<p>Partially yes.</p>



<p>If too much coffee is drunk, insulin signal and mTOR will be stimulate that will stop autophagy. Nevertheless, the polyphenols or plant compounds in coffee can stimulate AMPK, so coffee tends to start autophagy in general.</p>



<h3>How Much Coffee Can I Drink Every Day if My Fasting isn’t Broken?</h3>



<p>Generally speaking, 5 teacups of coffee can be drunk during 24 hours, which won’t have obvious effect on your blood sugar on an empty stomach. 1 to 2 teacups of coffee don’t stimulate mTOR or reduce ketone as long as you don’t suffer from diabetes or slow down coffee metabolism genetically.</p>



<h3>What Can I Add to My Coffee that Won’t Break My Fasting?</h3>



<p>If you like flavored coffee, that’s also OK.</p>



<p>What can be added to your coffee for fasting, the key is to watch the <strong>calorie count</strong> and <strong>avoid sugars</strong>. One cup of just plain black coffee is only about three calories. This is why during fasting, having a couple cups of coffee will not take away the health benefits by affecting your metabolic change in a negative way. If you need to add something to the coffee to make it more suitable for your taste, a little bit of artificial sweetener probably won’t hurt you. Still, don’t go overboard with it. In fact, you would be better off trying a few sprinkles of cinnamon instead. Cinnamon is loaded with antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties.</p>



<p>Other things that can be added to your coffee that won’t break your fasting include:</p>



<ul><li>A sprinkle of cinnamon</li><li>A little nutmeg</li><li>A little cocoa</li><li>Some sweet flavor without fat like stevia</li><li>Some sugar-free almond milk</li></ul>



<h3>What to Avoid Adding to Coffee for Fasting?</h3>



<p>As stated above, the elaborate coffee available nowadays at the stylish shops and cafes are not only pricey, but they can be as high in calories as a milkshake. Milkshakes won’t help you lose weight.</p>



<p>Anything that adds calories to your coffee needs to be looked at closely. If the coffee is getting close to 50 calories or above, it can knock you out of fasting. Adding milk and sugar can easily make that cup of coffee a couple hundred calories. It is best to avoid the heavy creamers, the fancy flavoring, and anything else that will have your calorie count climbing.</p>



<h3>Play It Smart: Use Coffee to Strengthen Your Fasting</h3>



<p>Drinking coffee while fasting for eight to twelve hours is fine as long as you don’t overdo it. Try to limit yourself to two cups and keep them low calorie and you can still have all the health benefits. However, don’t feel like you have to drink coffee while fasting if you are not a fan of the beverage. Water and certain teas are perfectly fine as well!</p>



<h3>Besides Coffee, What Else Can I Drink During Intermittent Fasting?</h3>



<p>One rule, any drink is OK with intermittent fasting as long as no sugar is included. Of course, alcoholic drinks aren’t suggested for the sake of your health.</p>



<h4><strong>The Best Drink: Water</strong></h4>



<p>Water is naturally free of calories and a must-have necessity to your body.</p>



<p>Do you know sometimes emotional hunger is aroused because you’re thirsty? Drinking water is beneficial for you to avoid the risk of the following diseases:</p>



<ul><li>Heart diseases</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>High cholesterol</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Overweight</li></ul>



<p>If you’d like flavored water, you can try adding some lemonade to it. As a natural flavor, lemonade contains zero calory.</p>



<h4><strong>Tea</strong></h4>



<p>Similar to black coffee, tea contains zero calories. Any type of brewed tea is friendly with intermittent fasting no matter it comes from tea bags, leaves, or flakes. High-calorie food should be avoided being added water for fasting such as honey, milk, or heavy cream, which is the same as coffee intake.</p>

This agreement is entered into freely by both parties set forth in the signature block below (“Buyer” and “Seller”) and both parties agree to honor and be bound by the terms of this agreement in any court, real, imagined, or otherwise, or as set before any judge or any being serving in a similarly recognizable capacity making judgment as to the validity of this contract, in any state of reality or nonreality, physical or metaphysical, for all eternity (past, present, and future) and also any states of being or nonbeing outside of our human conception of time.</p><p><strong>BUYER AND SELLER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p><p><strong>SECTION I. DEFINITION OF “SOUL”</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;The “Soul” of the Seller for the purposes of this contract is understood to mean the spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence of their self which exists independently and distinctly from their material being.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; While both the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that the true nature, scope, and existence of any Such soul, whether or not it exists, is unknown and unknowable to either of them, the ambiguity involved in no way limits or renders any portion of this agreement invalid and the total scope of the Soul shall be considered as subject to the agreement.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Seller’s religion or belief system lacking a concept of a “Soul” or metaphysical reality lacking the concept of a “Soul” as given shall not alter the stated intent of this contract, and the essence being transferred to the Buyer shall constitute whatever immaterial equivalent, if any, exists that is closest in nature to the given definition of the Seller’s spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that a “Soul” is not actually immortal, this contract shall remain in effect through whatever duration of time or non-time that the soul exists in any manner, state, or way of being.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the event that the Seller’s “Soul” does not exist as an independent entity outside of the whole “one-ness” of reality as commonly described in some belief systems, and in the event that this belief about the nature of reality reflects actual reality, this contract will remain in effect for whatever period of time or non-time and to whatever degree that the Seller’s immaterial essence is distinguishable in any form, manner, or state of being from the sum whole of immaterial or material existence.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Buyer acknowledges and fully understands that the Seller may deny the existence of any such Soul as defined here in Section I or deny the possibility of transferring ownership of said Soul to another party according to their personal belief system. Buyer agrees to accept the risk of being unable to actually take possession of said Soul from the selling party due to either its nonexistence or non-transferability on the part of the Soul’s owner.</p><p><strong>SECTION II. SALE AND TRANSFER OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller intend this Agreement to be a contract of sale for the Seller’s Soul, as defined in Section I, wherein the Buyer shall provide the compensation outlined in Section III in exchange for ownership and use of the Seller’s Soul as described in Sections I and IV.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The transfer of ownership of this Soul shall occur at the moment this document is signed and returned to the Buyer by the Seller in any format, electronic or physical.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;If for any reason this Soul or a portion of this Soul shall be found to be non-transferable from Seller to Buyer, this shall in no way limit the other provisions of this agreement or the Buyer’s rights with respect to use and possession of the Soul. Seller agrees to transfer ownership of Soul to Buyer to whatever degree is possible, in part or in whole, and commits to the terms of usage, transfer, or possession of Soul as described in Section IV to whatever degree may be possible.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;As compensation for this transfer of ownership of the Soul, Buyer agrees to compensate Seller an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars, to be transferred according to the terms given in Section III, within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer provides the Buyer with full usage rights and ownership of the soul to do with as they see fit, including but not limited to the provisions given in Section IV of this document.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer prevents the Seller from any personal or public use of or claim of ownership to the transferred Soul without the express permission, in writing, of the Buyer. Other than limiting their making claims of ownership to the Soul, this clause shall in no way limit the material actions of the Seller.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;This transfer is permanent and irrevocable except as given in the terms of this contract. Buyer shall be the new owner of Seller’s Soul for all time and non-time and states of being, with all according rights and privileges of use as given in Section IV.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that actual possession, use, or storage of the Soul by the Buyer is not required for Buyer’s ownership, transfer, or future use of the Soul to be enforceable under these terms. Buyer may, at their discretion, leave the Soul in the location it currently exists or move it from its current location at any time and at their own discretion. Buyer may use or not use the soul as Buyer sees fit. Failure to take possession of or to use the Soul shall in no way invalidate the ownership, usage rights, subsequent transfer, or any other term of this contract with respect to the transferred Soul.</p><p><strong>SECTION III. COMPENSATION FOR TRANSFER</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer agrees to compensate Seller with an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars for the transfer of the Soul within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic, as described in Section II-C, according to the conditions outlined in this Section (III).</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The sending of these funds (hereafter “the payment”) shall occur via PayPal.com and shall be sent to an electronic mail address provided by the Seller.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that no address is provided by the Seller to render the payment, Buyer will send payment to the address used to transfer electronically signed contract documents or make a reasonable attempt to acquire such an address from the Seller via the same communication medium over which the signed documents are transferred. Failure to acquire a valid payment address from Seller within the 48-hour period shall not invalidate the contract or the Buyer’s ownership and usage of transferred Soul provided this is the primary reason for the Buyer’s inability to render compensation.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller acknowledges that small variations in actual value of currency may occur from moment to moment and that in sending a nominal amount of $10 USD via the PayPal payments system within 48 hours of receipt of the contract as described in Section III-A, they have satisfied their obligation to compensate the Seller under the terms of this agreement.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to pay any and all standard PayPal fee percentages that may arise in the course of transferring sent funds to their personal accounts.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees that their failure to accept the funds shall in no way invalidate the agreement and that the contract will remain completely whole and enforceable regardless of their acceptance or non-acceptance of the payment.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that the Buyer fails to send the compensation as described in this Section (III) within 48 hours of receipt of the contract signed by the Seller, the contract will be considered null and void and the ownership of the Soul shall revert to the Seller.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;No action or use of the Soul may be undertaken by the Buyer within the 48-hour period beginning with the receipt of the contract signed by the Seller until and unless the Buyer has adequately rendered payment to Seller as described in this Section (III).</p><p><strong>SECTION IV. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that the owner of the Soul may possess, claim, keep, store, offer, transfer, or make use of it in whole or in part in any manner that they see fit to do so, conventional or otherwise, including (but not limited to) the purposes described in this Section (IV). Example uses of the Soul which would be permitted under these terms include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Publicly claiming to be the owner of the Soul in question.</li><li>Transferring of said Soul, in whole or part, to any person or entity, for any reason.</li><li>Sacrificing or offering said Soul, in whole or in part, to any deity or spiritual entity.</li><li>Spending or using the soul, in whole or in part, for some purpose which causes it to diminish in value, quantity, or substance or be subsumed into a larger whole.</li><li>Transferring the burden, credit, or responsibility of any actions reflected in the State of a Soul from another Soul to this Soul or from this Soul to another Soul.</li><li>Long term storage, usage, or preservation of the Soul in a state which would prevent it from taking the course of development, evolution, or relocation it may otherwise take naturally or due to the actions or material status of the Seller.</li></ul><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to fully relinquish any right of ownership or usage they have in the Soul and agrees that they will not attempt to use, keep, transfer, or sell the same Soul again even if it remains in their possession or immediate vicinity.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller agrees not to interfere or attempt to interfere via metaphysical, magickal, or spiritual means with Buyer’s attempt to claim, transfer, or …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="section-5-61"><div><div id="new_columns-6-61"><div id="div_block-7-61"><p><span id="span-26-61">
<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

        <p>As your scientific career advances, you will have to supply publication
lists, sometimes also known as ‘research output lists’ or some such
nonsense,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for all kinds of purposes. I used to do this manually,
but with an increasing number of publications and requirements for the
publication lists, I started to lose track.</p>
<p>Following my maxim of ‘automate the boring stuff if you need it
repeatedly’, I developed a solution based on BibLaTeX to typeset my
publication list for me. The best thing: it can be easily adjusted to
fit different occasions, as we will see!</p>

<p>To get started, you will first need to store your publications in
a bibliography file. See <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/bibliography/">my previous post on how to keep a bibliography</a>
for details on how to accomplish this. I will use a simple entry of an
<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/moor20a.html">actual publication of mine</a> as an example:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This entry is nothing out of the ordinary—except for the <code>author+an</code>
field, whose purpose will become clear later on. Putting this in a file
<code>Publications.bib</code>, we may now start a new LaTeX document called
<code>Publications.tex</code>. The file can use <em>any</em> document class of your
choice, but the important parts are how we load the <code>biblatex</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\usepackage</span>[
  backend      = biber,
  doi          = false,
  giveninits   = false,
  maxcitenames = 99,
  isbn         = false,
  url          = false,
]<span>{</span>biblatex<span>}</span>

<span>\addbibresource</span><span>{</span>Publications.bib<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that <code>biblatex</code> already provides some global options for
including/excluding some fields. For example, if I need a publication
list with additional details about where to find the publication,
I could set <code>doi = true</code> to include DOIs whenever available. Likewise,
if I want to save some space, I could set <code>giveninits = true</code> to ensure
that only the initials of first names are used, leading to ‘B. Rieck’ as
opposed to ‘Bastian Rieck’.</p>

<p>If I need more control and want to remove specific fields, I can use use
<code>\AtEveryCitekey</code> and <code>\AtEveryBibitem</code>.  For example, to remove the
month, the editor, and the location of every entry, we could use the
following construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\AtEveryBibitem{\clearfield{month}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryCitekey{\clearfield{month}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryBibitem{\clearname{editor}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryCitekey{\clearname{editor}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryBibitem{\clearlist{location}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryCitekey{\clearlist{location}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The apparent duplication of commands is only required if we want to use
<code>\printbibliography</code> <em>and</em> <code>\fullcite</code>&nbsp;(see below for more details
on this). If you are content with only using <code>\fullcite</code>, it is
sufficient to use <code>\AtEveryCitekey</code>.</p>
<p>The neat thing is that this all works <em>without</em> changing your original
<code>Publications.bib</code> file, making it very easy to print a condensed
variant or an extended variant of your bibliography as the occasion
requires. The example also demonstrates that different
fields require different commands; see <a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf">the BibLaTeX
documentation</a>
for more details.</p>

<p>As a personal preference, I like to change the way certain elements are
typeset. For example, I tend to prefer titles being typeset in
<em>italics</em>, whereas the journal name itself should just be typeset in an
upright font—briefly put, I want my publication list to follow the
manually-curated entries on my <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/research/">research page</a>.
If your preference is different, feel free to adjust this to your
heart’s desire!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\DeclareFieldFormat[article, incollection, inproceedings, misc, unpublished]{title}{\textit{#1}}</span>
<span>\DeclareFieldFormat[article]{journaltitle}{\upshape{#1}}</span>
<span>\DeclareFieldFormat[incollection, inproceedings]{booktitle}{\upshape{#1}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For even more control over how certain entries are printed, you can
update internal macros. To remove the date from an issue of a journal
article, you can update the <code>issue+date</code> macro, for instance:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\renewbibmacro*{issue+date}{%</span>
  <span>\setunit{\addcomma\space}</span>
    <span>\iffieldundef{issue}</span>
      <span>{\usebibmacro{date}}</span>
      <span>{\printfield{issue}%</span>
       <span>\setunit*{\addspace}%</span>
       <span>\usebibmacro{date}%</span>
      <span>}%</span>
  <span>\newunit%</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>See the file <code>standard.bbx</code> of your local BibLaTeX installation for an
overview of all the macros. Their number is legion—and I have to admit
that I am now quite content with their default settings in most cases, except
for the way the publisher and location are being printed. In lieu of the
default macro, which employs a colon for separating the publisher and
the location, I prefer commas, so I use the following construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\renewbibmacro*{publisher+location+date}{%</span>
  <span>\printlist{publisher}%</span>
  <span>\setunit*{\addcomma\space}%</span>
  <span>\printlist{location}%</span>
  <span>\setunit*{\addcomma\space}%</span>
  <span>\usebibmacro{date}%</span>
  <span>\newunit%</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is probably less important to you if you do not use the <code>location</code>
field; and a quick check of my own bibliography shows that I mostly
dropped the field altogether because it does not provide any added value
for me.</p>

<p>To actually print out the entries in your document, you have multiple
options. The first option entails making use of <code>\printbibliography</code>,
thus losing out on <em>some</em> customisation options, whereas the second
option involves using <code>\fullcite</code>, which requires some manual
interventions but is overall more flexible.</p>
<h2 id="option-i-printbibliography">Option I: <code>\printbibliography</code></h2>
<p>Your main document is very simple in this case:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
  <span>\nocite</span><span>{</span>*<span>}</span>
  <span>\printbibliography</span><span>[title=Peer-reviewed Articles]</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Short, sweet, and still somewhat customisable! For example, if you
want to print out only articles of a certain type, you could add
a <code>keywords</code> entry to your bibliography, and use the following
construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex">  <span>\printbibliography</span><span>[title=Posters, keyword=poster]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What I dislike about this solution is that I often have to pick the
articles I want to print quite carefully; many of them require
additional annotations. Moreover, I prefer to have a running number of
my publications in a publication list. For this reason, I prefer to use
<code>\fullcite</code>.</p>
<h2 id="option-ii-fullcite">Option II: <code>\fullcite</code></h2>
<p>Here, your document structure becomes a little bit more convoluted, but
you also gain additional control over how entries are formatted. The
primary advantages of this approach are that you can drop publications
easily&nbsp;(in case you are restricted to publications of a certain
area), you can change the ordering, and you can use <em>one</em> running
counter of publications, which some funding agencies like to see because
it more publications means more science means more relevance, or
something like that. Here’s how you accomplish such a list:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>enumitem<span>}</span>

<span>\begin</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
  <span>\section*</span><span>{</span>Conference publications<span>}</span>

  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
    <span>\item\fullcite</span><span>{</span>Moor20a<span>}</span>
  <span>\end</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>

  <span>\section*</span><span>{</span>Journal publications<span>}</span>

  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>[resume]
    <span>\item\fullcite</span><span>{</span>Bock18<span>}</span>
  <span>\end</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The neat thing about this list is that you can use the margin of the
page to add additional annotations. For example, to highlight your
favourite publications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, you can use the following construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>fontawesome<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>marginnote<span>}</span>

<span>% Controls the way these notes are being typeset with respect to the
</span><span>% margin of the page. Update this as necessary!
</span><span></span><span>\setlength</span><span>{</span><span>\marginparsep</span><span>}{</span>0.5cm<span>}</span>

<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\favourite</span><span>}{</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\strut\marginnote</span><span>{</span><span>\faStar</span><span>}</span><span>%
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This gives you the opportunity to highlight a publication as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
  <span>\item\favourite\fullcite</span><span>{</span>Moor20a<span>}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The price that you pay for this flexibility is that you have to list
your publications manually, but at least you control their ordering and
only have to adjust all their details in one single file; you can use
the <em>same</em> list of publications with a different preamble to easily
change the way things are being depicted. I like to keep a ‘condensed’
version of the publication list handy for grants, while my CV contains
everything.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: There might be some minor differences in how
<code>\fullcite</code> prints an entry as compared to <code>\printbibliography</code>. If you
want to add a period after each list entry, you need to change how
<code>\fullcite</code> works under the hood. For example, you could redefine
<code>\fullcite</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\DeclareCiteCommand</span><span>{</span><span>\fullcite</span><span>}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\usebibmacro</span><span>{</span>prenote<span>}}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\usedriver</span><span>{}{</span><span>\thefield</span><span>{</span>entrytype<span>}}</span>.<span>}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\multicitedelim</span><span>}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\usebibmacro</span><span>{</span>postnote<span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, if it is important to you, you can also add the periods
manually.</p>

<p>As a finishing touch, I always aim to highlight equal contributions,
equal supervision, and myself in the publication list. The first two
things are primary done out of fairness—if a publication has multiple
authors who contributed to it, <em>any</em> publication list should reflect
this—while the last thing is done out of an instinct for
self-preservation: since the publication list is supposed to show my own
contributions to science, I figured it made sense to highlight my
own name. To accomplish this, I used the <code>+an</code> mechanism that permits us
to include annotations for BibLaTeX to use later on when typesetting
a citation.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished by updating the way author names are being
printed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\renewcommand*</span><span>{</span><span>\mkbibcompletename</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\ifitemannotation</span><span>{</span>highlight<span>}</span>
    <span>{</span><span>\textbf</span><span>{</span>#1<span>}}</span>
    <span>{</span>#1<span>}</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\ifitemannotation</span><span>{</span>first<span>}</span>
    <span>{</span><span>\kern</span>-0.05em<span>\textsuperscript</span><span>{</span><span>$</span><span>\dagger</span><span>$</span><span>}}</span>
    <span>{}</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\ifitemannotation</span><span>{</span>last<span>}</span>
    <span>{</span><span>\textsuperscript</span><span>{</span><span>$</span><span>\ddagger</span><span>$</span><span>}}</span>
    <span>{}</span><span>%
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can see that is use a <strong>bold</strong> font to print all names that contain
the <code>highlight</code> annotation. For the equal contributions, I use <code>first</code>
and <code>last</code> to indicate joint first authorship and joint supervision,
respectively. Feel free to change the symbols here—I like the
dagger<sup>†</sup> to indicate joint first authors<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and the
diesis or double dagger<sup>‡</sup> to indicate …</p></div></div>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>
 
<div>
<p><small>[Photograph by Literary and Media Committe, TAPMI]</small></p>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<p>It’s interesting how learning is sometimes like travel. At the end of the journey, you end up back where you started, only with a broadened perspective.</p>
<p>Trivial example: code comments. When I was new to programming I commented my code extensively. If I’m honest, it was to compensate for my difficulties in reading code. A consequence of this is it allowed me to be lazy in the code I wrote. I wouldn’t need to put much effort into making it clear and readable because there were always plain English comments to fall back on.</p>
<p>Then I joined a team that was militantly against comments, where every comment was an admission of failure to write readable code. I took this on-board and disciplined myself not to rely on comments. This forced me to spend more time on refactoring my code to make it as readable and “self-documenting” as possible. I still wouldn’t say I’m there yet, but I’m confident that my code is much more readable now than it was then.</p>
<p>However, in the last year or so, I’ve started adding comments again. Not too many, but here and there to add more context. It felt like blasphemy at first. Some of my comments are even somewhat redundant, but I’ve since learned that <a href="https://www.cnothelfer.com/redundant-encoding">encoding the same information in redundant ways</a> is an important principle for aiding our comprehension. For example, traffic lights use both colour and position to encode the same information.</p>
<p>Superficially it seems as though I’ve returned to where I started: I’m commenting code again. However, if I hadn’t disciplined myself to do without comments entirely for a while, I wouldn’t have been forced to learn how to write more readable code. Abstaining from code comments is a <a href="https://coderefinery.nz/2020/10/21/forcing-functions-in-software-development/">forcing function</a> for learning to write more readable code. At some point, you can re-integrate commenting as a useful tool rather than a crutch.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I’m confident that if I could travel back in time and tell past-me or any of my old teammates that, actually, comments can be a valuable tool to aid comprehension, I’m positive I would encounter strong resistance. This is just as it should be; I don’t think it can be any different. When you’re learning a new skill, it’s necessary to become somewhat closed off and follow a direction single-mindedly for a while, it’s part of the learning process. If you were too suggestible and deviated too easily, you would go around in small circles and never get anywhere.</p>
<p>You see the same pattern across the development community when a new technology or framework is introduced (I won’t name names. I’m sure you can think of some examples). In the early days, there is hype and zealotry. Then over time as more developers adopt the tech into production and real issues with it emerge, there is disillusionment and abandonment. Finally a more realistic, calibrated picture of the trade-offs of the technology emerge.</p>

<p>A stunning admission by the US government that it possesses UFO debris was recently made in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed over three years ago by this author. In a reply letter, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has ended decades of speculation by verifying that UFO material has indeed been recovered. Now officially referred to as UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) rather than UFOs, some of this material was placed with a defense contractor for analysis and storage in "specialized facilities." Incredibly, part of the information released discusses material with shape recovery properties, much like the "memory metal" debris found fallen at the Roswell UFO crash in 1947.</p>



<p>And based on the documentation received, it appears that the retrieved debris exhibits other extraordinary capabilities. In addition to "remembering" their original form when bent or crushed, some of these futuristic materials have the potential to make things invisible, "compress" electromagnetic energy, and even slow down the speed of light. Although much of the reports' details are redacted, what can be gleaned is that these technologies represent a literal quantum leap beyond the properties of all existing material known to man.</p>



<p>Finally, the whereabouts of the UFO debris held by the contractor is unknown. Some months ago they laid off their employees and ceased operations. Former company officials, when reached, refuse comment.</p>



<h6>THE FOIA REQUEST</h6>



<p>The original 2017 FOIA request made to the DIA asks for the physical descriptions, properties and composition of UFO/UAP material held by the government and its contractor. The request is unambiguous in its meaning. It refers to UFO/UAP material and "physical debris recovered by personnel of the Department of Defense as residue, flotsam, shot-off material or crashed UAPs or unidentified flying objects." The FOIA request can be seen in full <a href="https://7f215854-ce29-4a12-9bb0-f4e7eb88d38a.filesusr.com/ugd/aa4aac_c53f66ccc2f745908c6b639c1042977e.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span>here:</span></span></span></a></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-kkurd3px" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>In their reply, the DIA amazingly agrees that it has documents responsive to my request on recovered UFO debris and its analysis, the program under which it was administered, AATIP (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program), and that their defense contractor (Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada) has stored the material. They also provide some reports related to the possible applications of the studied material.</p>



<p>The delays and excuses offered up during the years awaiting the FOIA response were many. They include that the records search involved another agency that needed to be consulted; that I had been emailing my former FOIA Officer though she'd left months ago and never received my follow-up communication; to a re-assignment of my case to the DIA's FOIA Chief, Steve Tumiski. After a lawsuit was threatened with the retention of counsel, the DIA somehow, after so very long, acted to respond.</p>



<h6>THE RELATION TO ROSWELL</h6>

</div><p>The information received includes several pages of what are called "advanced technology reports" on Nitinol - a shape recovery alloy. Nitinol has similar properties to the "memory metal" found fallen as debris at the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash of 1947. The pages found within the FOIA reply on Nitinol explore its potential for integrating it into the human body for the improvement of health. Well over 40 witnesses to Roswell have mentioned a metal-like material that could "remember itself" when deformed or folded, returning to its original state seamlessly and instantly. In a series of investigative articles appearing in the UFO Explorations website article archive section, the case is credibly made that Nitinol represents our first</p><div id="comp-kkuwalzl" title=""><div data-testid="linkElement"><wix-image id="img_comp-kkuwalzl" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kkuwalzl&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:719,&quot;height&quot;:406,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" data-image-zoomed="" data-has-ssr-src="true"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_169,h_96,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/Roswell%20Disc%2C%20719x406%2C%20enhanced%20with%20Pho.png" alt="Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho"></wix-image></div></div><div id="comp-kkuwz42y" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>attempts to replicate a material of the craft's construction. The Roswell debris was flown to Wright Field in Ohio after the crash. Some months later, Wright granted a contract to Battelle Memorial Institute to begin phase diagrams (recipes) for mixing Nickel and ultra-high-purity Titanium, required to make memory metal. General Arthur Exon, Base Commander at Wright Patterson in the 1960s, who flew over the crash site in 1947, spoke to researcher Kevin Randle on tape. He stated that it was his understanding that some of the wreckage being tested was comprised in part of "specially processed" Titanium.</p>



<p>And in September of 1947, two months after the Roswell crash, General George Shulgen of Air Intelligence described "the materials of construction" of the flying saucers as potentially being made of <span>"composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metal and plastics."&nbsp;</span> Some of the Roswell crash debris was said to display metal-plastic like appearance and characteristics. The DIA-sponsored reports I received mention a highly-engineered material called "metamaterial" (see below) as comprised of <span>"composite media."</span> Metamaterial can be <span>layered with metal and plastics.</span></p>



<p>Throughout the received FOIA documents, mention is made of potential use of some of the materials in "advanced aerospace platforms." Reference is made to desired material characteristics such as being extremely lightweight and tough, like the characteristics of the debris found at the Roswell crash.</p>



<h6>OTHER MATERIAL</h6>



<p>Extensive reference is also made to the study and application of what the tests called <span>metamaterial</span>*, including that some of this material:</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Can be used to "slow down light" and even "bring light to a complete standstill"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to manipulate the speed of light (electromagnetic energy traveling at 186,000 miles per second)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>May induce invisibility by manipulating refraction, reflectivity and increasing light absorption. The reports use terms like "optical isolation" and "transparency" and make reference to a "MetaMirror" technology</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to make something unable to be seen, and/or picked up by radar, scanning or imaging)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Has the interesting ability to "compress electromagnetic energy"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Such condensing can make information and energy storage smaller and their transfer faster by reducing volume)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Exhibits a particular "tunable resonance" which was likely "determined during fabrication."</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(The phrase "tunable resonance" refers to a vibration of large amplitude from a small stimulus. Very recent research shows potential in the field of "energy harvesting" technologies, or pulling energy from the environment for low-power electronic devices)</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>There seem to be many exciting, but far in the future, technical applications to these materials that will change the way our lives are lived.</p>



<p><span>*Metamaterial</span>, a coined and relatively recent word, is believed to be any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. Some of these materials appear to be made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. These composite media can be engineered to exhibit unique electromagnetic properties. Made up from subwavelength building blocks (most often based on metals), these metamaterials allow for extreme control over light energy and optical fields, enabling such effects such as negative refraction to be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Portions of the reports center on next-generation <span>Amorphous Metals</span> (also called "liquid metal" or "metallic glass") which are novel engineering alloys with disordered atomic-scale structure. Metal is crystalline in its solid state, which means it has a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals though are crazily disordered - a metal-like material so unique that it is believed it may one day replace plastic and metal in many applications. The material is stronger and lighter than any existing metal, can be injection molded like plastic (no rivets, seams or joining, smooth like many reported UFOs) and will never corrode or rust. Imagine using a single razor blade for the rest of your life because it stays super sharp forever. A golf club so springy it can drive a ball farther than any pro ever has. An artificial hip implant that performs better than a real hip. A cell phone case that is completely indestructible.</p>



<p>The contract that Bigelow was granted was under the auspices of an official government UFO study (whose existence was revealed by <span>The New York Times</span> in 2017). The contract was for Bigelow to construct "specialized modified facilities" to hold the material for testing. The DoD/Pentagon UFO study effort was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). It ran for some years (and under more than one name), and according to informed sources, remains in operation to this day. What is inside these "specially modified facilities" that requires such contracted technical services? What is the nature of this anomalous debris and what are its properties that it requires shielding?</p>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>Main</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>
<p><img src="https://synack.me/img/raspberrypi-swd.png" alt="Raspberry Pi SWD wiring"></p>
<div><div><pre><code>ssh pi@192.168.1.202 -L3333:localhost:3333
openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg

arm-eabi-gdb obj/main
target extended-remote localhost:3333
monitor arm semihosting enable
load
run
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_CSR</span> <span>:=</span>
    <span>(</span><span>CLKSOURCE</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>--  cpu clock</span>

     <span>others</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Ticks</span> <span>:</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span>

         <span>External_Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"isr_systick"</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>Ticks</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Ticks</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>procedure</span> <span>Wait</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Machine_Code</span><span>.</span><span>Asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"wfi"</span><span>,</span> <span>Volatile</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Wait</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>

<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

            <p> This screener assesses stocks by the following two factors:
                </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest short interest</li>
            <li>Mentions on Reddit</li>
        </ul><p>
        An indicator of whether they may be the next "meme stock". Short interest represents the total number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is a helpful indicator that gives people an idea of what the overall market feels about a particular stock by showing what short-sellers are doing.
Historically, hedge funds would often announce their short position on a stock.
Investors can take advantage of understanding short interest by being able to predict the next “short squeeze”; in other words, a situation in which the stock jumps sharply higher, forcing short sellers who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent even bigger losses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                                </div>
                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<p><span>When discussing symmetric encryption algorithms - like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - you may have been considering using AES-128 or AES-256. The last three digits represent the length of the secret key – think of it like the number of teeth in a physical key. From a security perspective, a 256-bit secret key is obviously better, but does it really matter which of the two options you choose? This article walks through some of the main security considerations for AES-128 and AES-256.</span></p>
<h2><span>Brute Force Attack Protection</span></h2>
<p><span>A brute force key guessing attack is where an attacker tries each potential secret key until the right one is found. This attack is guaranteed to succeed (eventually) and (ideally) should be the fastest way to break an encryption algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>When discussing brute force attack protection, understanding just what different key lengths mean is essential. With the impending arrival of quantum computing, it is also good to know how they will impact cryptographic security. Are the current forms of AES strong enough?</span></p>
<h2><span>The Difference in Key Length</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference between 128 and 256-bit encryption algorithms is the length of the secret key that they use. The 128 and 256 in AES-128 and AES-256 means that the two algorithms use 128-bit and 256-bit keys respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>The longer the secret key, the harder it is for an attacker to guess via brute force attack. However, AES-256 is not just twice as strong as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>With 128 and 256-bit secret keys, AES-128 and AES-256 have 2<sup>128</sup> and 2<sup>256</sup> potential secret keys respectively. With binary keys, each bit added to the key length doubles the key space. This means that AES-256 has 2^128 or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 times as many keys as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, a brute force attack against an AES-256 key is much harder than against an AES-128 key. However, even a 128-bit key is secure against attack by modern technology. At its peak, the Bitcoin network - arguably the largest modern use of computational power for cryptography - <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate?scale=1&amp;timespan=all">performed approximately</a></span> 150*10^18≈2^67 operations per second. Assuming that these operations are of equal difficulty to a brute force attack, it would take the Bitcoin network over 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to crack a single AES-128 key.</p>
<h2><span>Resistance to Quantum Computing</span></h2>
<p><span>The threat of quantum computing to cryptography has been well-publicized. Quantum computers work very differently than classical ones, and quantum algorithms can make attacks against cryptography much more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of asymmetric encryption algorithms (like RSA), quantum computing completely breaks them. However, for symmetric algorithms like AES, Grover’s algorithm - the best known algorithm for attacking these encryption algorithms - only weakens them. Grover’s algorithm decreases the effective key length of a symmetric encryption algorithm by half, so AES-128 has an effective key space of 2^64 and AES-256 has an effective key space of 2^128.</span></p>
<p><span>However, while this seems significant, it doesn’t break either algorithm. With the right quantum computer, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25196/chapter/6#98"><span>AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack</span></a>, while AES-256 would take 2.29*10^32 years. For reference, the universe is currently <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/15/age-universe-13-8-billion-years-scientists-confirm/3287409001/"><span>about 1.38x10^10 years old</span></a>, so cracking AES-128 with a quantum computer would take about 200 times longer than the universe has existed.</span></p>
<p><span>This also makes the assumption that an attacker has the “right” quantum computer. Cracking AES-128 would take an estimated 2,953 logical qubits and AES-256 would require 6,681. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023"><span>largest quantum computer had 65 qubits</span></a> with a goal of hitting 1,000 by 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span>128 and 256-Bit Algorithms Under the Hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Brute force attacks against a secret key are the best potential attack against a secure algorithm but what if the algorithm is has a vulnerability?</span></p>
<p><span>AES is broken up into two distinct algorithms: the encryption algorithm (which does the actual encryption) and the key schedule (which converts the secret key into round keys). The security of each of these matters to the security of AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Encryption Algorithm</span></h2>
<p><span>AES-128 and AES-256 use an almost identical encryption algorithm. Each encryption algorithm takes a set of operations and applies them a certain number of times or “rounds”. The only difference between AES encryption algorithms is the number of rounds: AES-128 uses 10 and AES-256 uses 14.</span></p>
<p><span>This means that, if an attack against the AES algorithm was discovered, it would likely affect both AES-128 and AES-256. The only difference is if the attack only worked up to a certain number of rounds of AES (which some AES attacks do). If an attack worked for at least ten rounds but less than fourteen, then a clear winner exists between AES-128 and AES-256. However, no such attack is currently known for AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Key Schedule</span></h2>
<p><span>The key schedule is where AES-128 and AES-256 become very different. The AES-128 key schedule is designed to turn a 128-bit secret key into ten 128-bit round keys. The AES-256 key schedule transforms a 256-bit secret key into fourteen 128-bit rounds keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Of the two, the AES-128 key schedule is actually more secure. The AES-256 key schedule has known weaknesses that might make it possible to perform related key attacks against the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>A related key attack should never happen in real life. For it to occur, an attacker needs to: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span> </span><span>Convince the key owner to take their existing encryption key</span></li>
<li><span> Create three other keys based on this key using relationships known to the attacker</span></li>
<li><span> Encrypt <span>2<sup>99.5</sup> </span>&nbsp;(that’s eight followed by 29 zeros) blocks of data with these keys</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Even if this attack were feasible, it can be avoided simply by using good key generation practices. A truly random key should never be vulnerable to a related key attack because it has no related keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the fact that this attack is infeasible to perform, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html">some cryptographers advise</a> – when given a choice between AES-128 and AES-256 with no constraints – using AES-128 over AES-256. If you have a simpler algorithm with a stronger key schedule, why use the more complex one?</span></p>
<h2><span>Picking Between AES-128 and AES-256</span></h2>
<p><span>128-bit and 256-bit AES both have their pros and cons. AES-128 is faster and more efficient and less likely to have a full attack developed against it (due to a stronger key schedule). AES-256 is more resistant to brute force attacks and is only weak against related key attacks (which should never happen anyway).</span></p>
<p><span>Since both algorithms are secure against modern and anticipated future threats, the choice between them doesn’t really matter from a security perspective. Our best guidance is that </span>AES-128 provides more than adequate security while being faster and more resource-efficient but readers who want that extra security provided by greater key sizes and more rounds in the algorithm should choose AES-256.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

Its usage is split into two roles: one system is set up as the <strong>master</strong> and is responsible for controlling those systems that connect to it. One or more systems are then set up as <strong>minions</strong> that connect to the master and respond to any commands it issues.</p><p>Both master and minions are typically run as root on the systems they are installed on.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Whilst looking at the source code for SaltStack for one of the previously disclosed vulnerabilities at <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">work</a>, I decided to run the source code through <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit">Bandit</a>, a security scanner for Python applications to see how many issues it would find.</p><p>I was expecting to see quite a few results, as it has a relatively large codebase and has existed for several years. However, as can be seen in the screenshot below Bandit showed even more issues than I was expecting including 117 high severity issues.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_214009.png" alt=""><figcaption>Bandit's report for SaltStack Salt</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of these issues are false positives or of little importance to us, and it can take significant time to parse through all the data. For a quick win, I decided to focus my time researching some potential command injections due to several instances of <code>subprocess.Popen</code> used in conjunction with <code>shell=True</code> in the codebase.</p><p>After looking at a few of these that turned out not to be in any way controllable I found one that could be controlled via some clever trickery using process names.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png" alt="" srcset="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 600w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1000w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1089w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This is the vulnerability we're looking for</figcaption></figure><h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2><p>The minion's <code>restartcheck</code> is vulnerable to command injection via a crafted process name when this process has open file descriptors associated with <code> (deleted)</code> at the end of a filename (note the leading space is required). This allows for a local privilege escalation to root from any user able to create files on the minion in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><h3 id="vulnerable-code">Vulnerable Code</h3><p>The vulnerable code is at <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L615">line 615 in restartcheck.py</a> where <code>subprocess.Popen</code> is called with <code>shell=True</code> and a command that can be maniplulated by an attacker:</p><pre><code>cmd = cmd_pkg_query + package
paths = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre><p>Where <code>package</code> is formed from the process name and <code>cmd_pkg_query</code> is one of the following depending on the OS:</p><ul><li>Debian: <code>dpkg-query --listfiles</code></li><li>RedHat: <code>repoquery -l</code></li><li>NILinuxRT: <code>opkg files</code></li></ul><p>If we can insert a bash control character such as <code>;</code> <code>|</code> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> etc into the process name we can trigger the injection when this code is reached.</p><p>However, to reach this code, a process first needs to have a filehandler open to a file with a filename that ends in <code> (deleted)</code>, and this file needs to reside in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><p>The list of forbidden directories can be seen <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L33">here</a>. This deny list immediately rules out some of the more obvious places we might try to use such as <code>/tmp</code> or <code>/dev/shm</code>, however, there are a few common ones that a low privileged user may have access to such as:</p><ul><li><code>/var/crash</code></li><li><code>/var/spool/samba</code></li><li><code>/var/www</code></li></ul><h3 id="process-names">Process names</h3><p>During this research, it turned out that process names can be a surprisingly tricky thing to modify reliably, and a process name listed by <code>ps</code> may not be the same returned by the Python psutil library.</p><p>In Linux, process names can contain any characters (apart from null). Any user can start processes on a system and the process itself can set the process name. They are a good target for command injection vulnerabilities as developers are unlikely to expect process names to contain special characters or injections.</p><p>It is possible to use <code>exec -a </code> to directly set a process name; however, this doesn't work in <code>busybox</code> or <code>sh</code> shells and doesn't appear to show the same name when using <code>psutil</code>. It's also possible to modify the process name by directly manipulating procfs however this also leads to inconsistent results.</p><p>So in the end, the simplest and most consistent way to set a process name is to rename the binary or script being run. As filenames in Linux cannot contain <code>/</code> this restricts the commands we can inject, however using base64 encoding it is trivial to bypass this restriction as shown below:</p><pre><code># If we wanted to copy the shadow file to /tmp we could run this 
cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow

# Convert it to a base64 string
echo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow | base64 -w0

# The result of the conversion
Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK

# The new command we need to run
echo Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK|base64 -d|sh -i

<p><em>Editor’s Note: In December 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order that announced sanctions on Russian individuals and organizations in response to election interference efforts.</em></p>



<p><em>The list included several notorious hackers, as well as Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Also on the list was a lesser-known organization that left many puzzled: ZOR Security. The company was founded by Alisa Shevchenko, who worked as a virus analytics expert for Kaspersky Labs for several years and was passionate about building a co-working space for hackers and computer geeks. She had also been </em><a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-15-085-01A"><em>credited</em></a><em> by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for assisting Schneider Electric in finding vulnerabilities in their software.</em></p>



<p><em>According to the announcement, Shevchenko’s company was a supplier to the GRU, the group said to be behind the hack on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Shevchenko, who also goes by Alisa Esage, said U.S. authorities were mistaken, and that she had already closed her company. She currently works as an independent researcher, and is the founder of the </em><a href="https://zerodayengineering.com/"><em>Zero-Day Engineering project</em></a><em>, which shares technical knowledge and training on software vulnerability research.</em></p>



<p><em>Shevchenko talked to Recorded Future cyber threat intelligence expert Dmitry Smilyanets last week about her experience in 2016, her favorite vulnerabilities, and what it’s like to be a hacker in Russia. The conversation below, conducted in English, has been lightly edited for clarity:</em></p>



<p><strong>Dmitry Smilyanets: What was your reaction when you found out the U.S. government imposed sanctions on your company, ZOR Security?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alisa Esage:</strong> I tried to keep calm and prevent the major press from portraying me as a kind of dangerous evil bitch that masterminded the hack of the century. Meanwhile, I kept working on my projects.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png" alt="Alysa Esage" width="451" height="353" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png 1024w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-300x236.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-768x603.png 768w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1536x1206.png 1536w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>DS: How did it change your life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I guess it made me a specialist in thriving under U.S. sanctions.</p>



<p><strong>DS: You said authorities were mistaken—in what way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t care about this anymore. People have the right to make mistakes. And the U.S. government likes to sanction everyone to assert power where they don’t have it, so let them.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you still feel the pressure of sanctions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I definitely feel that something is happening, but I wouldn’t call it pressure. If somebody can’t work with me or benefit from my products because they fear the U.S. government, it’s their own problem.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How did you get into cybersecurity and hacking?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It all started with my father, Andrey. He was a talented electronics engineer, one of the first in Russia who started to assemble personal computers as a hobby when they were not generally available, based on spare parts and articles published in foreign technical magazines. He taught me to solder when I was 5 years old, I think. So I started reading books about computers and programming in early school and taught myself to code in C++ and x86 assembly language as soon as I got a PC at age 15. While still in school I learned reverse-engineering, solved ‘crackme’ challenges, hacked PC games and coded ‘keygens’ for fun, and participated in the Russian and international underground hacking scene, mostly on the side of low-level software cracking. That was the beginning of it.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you think it’s getting easier or more difficult for people to follow in your path?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It’s a bit of both. When I was getting started, there was very little information available on computer security specifically. The internet was slow, and only a handful of publications might help you, aside from some generic books on computer programming. I recall there was a website named… something about ethical hacking, presumably ran by a woman; the articles published on it inspired me and helped me to get started. Nowadays it’s totally different. The information is abundant. There are thousands of public sources on all topics in computer security, from tutorials for beginners to professional deep technical trainings on advanced topics (like the ones that I teach, offered by my company Zero Day Engineering). This is the easy side.</p>



<p>On the other hand, computer technologies are getting more and more complex, technological developments are accelerating, learning curves are steeper and as a result, it’s getting harder to achieve high levels of expertise in this. It takes more time—years and decades. Remember the old assumption, “hacker equals teenager,” and that a hacking career ought to wrap up before one’s 30th birthday? So untrue today. The majority of the best hackers I know are well into their 30s, and they are just getting started. This is what it takes to gain true mastery in advanced hacking of modern computer systems: a lifetime dedication.</p>



<blockquote><p>For women [hackers] specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love.”</p><cite>— Alisa Esage</cite></blockquote>



<p>Either way, I think that reaching truly advanced levels on this path is more of a destiny than a choice. It takes a very peculiar mindset that seems to be based on genetic data, among other factors, plus special circumstances in life to keep doing the impossible every day. There are plenty of easier ways to thrive and succeed in modern human society than pitching your brain against yet another hardened system. You know that you’re in it when you can’t live without it. And when it happens—congratulations, there is no turning back.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How would you advise other young women to get into a career like yours? What are the pros and cons of being a hacker?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> Find something that excites you, pick a specific task, and solve it until completion. Reflect and repeat. Solving technical tasks and completing them is essential to progress on this path, while passive consumption of information would mostly litter your brain and disrupt your technical creativity. Dedicate yourself to practice, read mostly primary sources (such as technical specifications, classical books, and high-quality blogs from researchers whose work you admire). It’s the same advice for both women and men.</p>



<p>For women specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love. Especially if you already know that deep technical work is your passion, then don’t let anyone side-track you into management, lecturing, report-writing, marketing, or whatever else supportive roles in the cyber industry. Men and women definitely face different challenges in this career path, though it does get better over time (though a lot much slower and to a lesser extent than it’s commonly suggested).</p>



<p>Pros and cons? It’s risky and fun, obviously.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What do you like most about your line of work? What about your least favorite parts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I like the uncertainty, the adversarial environment, hunting for bug bounties, and solving hard challenges. I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas. I dislike that I have to compete with many smart guys, who comprise a dominant majority in this space. Men and women were not made to compete with each other.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What is the coolest vulnerability you ever found?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> A DLL Hijacking remote code execution bug in Outlook Express in Windows XP. It was a long time ago when Windows XP was still in use on every personal computer, and not just on ATMs and POS terminals like nowadays. In my early career in vuln research, I developed a proprietary methodology to discover zero-day bugs of this class and found many issues including the one in OE. For many years after I found it, I used to check if it’s still unpatched and it was. Nowadays it’s probably a “forever-0day”, since XP is EoL. Long-lived and reliable exploits like that are always fascinating.</p>



<p>Nowadays DLL Hijacking issues (also known as Insecure Library Loading) are still very prominent. For instance, a bug of this type was recently patched in Zoom Client for Windows. It’s trivial to find and trivial to exploit. The fact that world-dominating software developers still allow such trivial programming mistakes indicates a severe lack of vulnerability awareness in the global software industry. It’s one of the reasons why my company is developing specialized vulnerability intelligence feeds that (aside from our trainings) should help to bridge this knowledge gap and make the Internet more secure for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>DS: In your opinion, what’s the easiest way to compromise an organization in 2021?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg 400w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-300x300.jpg 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> There is no such way, generally. Organizations are not uniform in their levels of security. What’s truly important to realize is that there exists a spectrum of offensive cyber technologies that may be leveraged to compromise an organization, from trivial to advanced. Attackers would typically go for the weakest link in the system, that can be broken with the easiest tech in the spectrum. As opposed to it, my professional choice is to specialize in the most advanced extreme of it—zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits, especially in hardened systems—because once you can solve a hard problem, everything else in the spectrum is a piece of cake. Also, because it’s kind of unstoppable. You can train your employees to avoid clicking on phishing that brings ransomware, you can establish a proper corporate policy to block insiders that deliver supply chain implants and leak your business secrets, but you can’t avoid technology altogether. And technological systems have bugs, that may be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. And game over.</p>



<blockquote><p>I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Another key point to realize is that, regardless of a security compromise scenario, the root cause of it is always a …</p></article></div>

<p>Have you heard of <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome</strong>?</p>



<p>It’s the condition of being distracted by “shiny” new things.</p>



<p>Fad diets, the latest gadgets, <a href="https://ozchen.medium.com/new-years-resolution-syndrome-db9f52e72a07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endless New Year’s resolutions</a> and yes…<strong>new stocks</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Shiny Stock Syndrome</strong> is the financial version of Shiny Object Syndrome.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever bought a new stock without doing research or feel like you’ve missed on out an investment…then you might have Shiny Stock Syndrome.</p>



<p><em>What if you miss out on the next Amazon, Netflix or Tesla? You don’t wanna be a dunce, do ya???</em></p>



<p>In other words, it’s financial FOMO. </p>



<p><strong>Hi, my name is Oz and I’m a cryptoholic… </strong></p>



<p>During the cryptomania of 2017, I bought several obscure cryptocurrencies thinking they’d simply go up. I did very little research on some of these cryptocurrencies. Some of these, like <a href="https://coin.market/crypto/linda-coin">LINDA coin</a>, are basically defunct. </p>



<p>I lost money. Luckily, I didn’t lose my shirt by holding <a href="https://ozchen.com/cryptocurrency-not-lottery-ticket/">more worthwhile crypto</a>. </p>



<p>That’s how I experienced Shiny Object Syndrome first hand.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is a solution to this pernicious mental condition. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-this-better-than-what-i-already-own">“Is this better than what I already own?”</h2>



<p>Shiny Stock Syndrome is an expression of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novelty effect</a></strong>. This is the bias towards preferring something just because it’s perceived as new. </p>



<p>After all, we like to read “news” …and not “olds.” (Hey, I gotta drop at least 1 dad joke in here.)</p>



<p>To counter the novelty effect, we can take advantage of another bias: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>, which is the preference for something we already own. </p>



<p>Use the endowment effect to pay as much attention to stocks you already own, compared to hot new stocks. </p>



<p>This insight from a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/5-questions-investors-should-ask-themselves-in-202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motley Fool podcast</a> really stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote><p>…for every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well. If I truly don’t feel confident enough to add to any of my existing businesses in my portfolio, then maybe that says to me, “Hey, you should probably sell one of these businesses if you don’t really like it that much.”</p><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>So I’m adding this to my list of heuristics for investing. </p>



<ul><li>If a new stock isn’t <em>more</em> compelling than current stocks, hold or buy more of what I already own</li><li>If my current stock becomes less compelling, then I should be willing to trade it for new stock</li></ul>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to sell a stock you already own. But this is a good thought exercise for <a href="https://ozchen.com/general-specific-framework/">practicing specificity</a>. That can look like…</p>



<ul><li>Listening to CEO interviews and following them on Twitter</li><li>Reading through a company’s financial statements </li><li>Subscribing to a company’s investor relations’ newsletter</li></ul>



<p id="h-stealing-toms-1-for-1-model">To leverage ownership bias for good, <strong>we should be as into our current investments as we are new ones.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p>TOMS Shoes pioneered the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90344987/toms-made-buy-one-give-one-famous-now-its-updating-the-model">One for One model</a> of giving 1 product away for every purchased shoe. </p>



<p><a href="https://ozchen.com/retail-investors-vs-professional-investors/">Individual investors</a> like you and I can <s>borrow</s> steal the One for One model to build conviction in our investments:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>“Any time I want to buy a new stock, I have to buy a stock that I already own. </p><p>For every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well.”</p></div><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>Yes, this means counteracting Shiny Stock Syndrome with….Stock Hold Syndrome 🤣</p>

CDC has been exchanging data with colleagues across the country and similar results are&nbsp;coming from&nbsp;Quebec, as well as from the U.K., Israel and other countries.</p>  <p>She also said&nbsp;the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has been looking at the issue and will be issuing a statement on the matter in the near future.</p>  <p>As of March 1, however, the advice&nbsp;NACI is providing on its website says&nbsp;that the interval between the first and second shots of the Moderna vaccine should be four weeks, the interval for Pfizer should be three weeks and the interval for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The head of Moderna's Canadian operations, Patricia Gauthier, told Kapelos Monday that the company's own trials, and the conditions under which the vaccine&nbsp;was approved by Health Canada, are tied to a four week interval.</p>  <p>"That being said, we're in times of pandemic and we can understand that there are difficult decisions to be made," Gauthier said. "This then becomes a government decision. We stand by the product monograph approved by Health Canada, but governments ... can make their own decisions."</p>  <p>Gauthier said she is not aware of any studies done or led by Moderna on what happens when the interval between the first and second doses is changed from four weeks to four months.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614633157759_7259"><div><p>On January 6, 2021, an armed mob stormed the US Capitol to prevent the certification of what they claimed was a “fraudulent election.” Many Americans were shocked, but they needn’t have been. The January 6 insurrection was the culmination of months of online mis- and disinformation directed toward eroding American faith in the 2020 election.</p><p>US elections are decentralized: almost 10,000 state and local election offices are primarily responsible for the operation of elections. Dozens of federal agencies support this effort, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. However, none of these federal agencies has a focus on, or authority regarding, election misinformation originating from domestic sources within the United States. This limited federal role reveals a critical gap for non-governmental entities to fill. Increasingly pervasive mis- and disinformation, both foreign and domestic, creates an urgent need for collaboration across government, civil society, media, and social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Election Integrity Partnership, comprising organizations that specialize in understanding those information dynamics, aimed to create a model for whole-of-society collaboration and facilitate cooperation among partners dedicated to a free and fair election. With the narrow aim of defending the 2020 election against voting-related mis- and disinformation, it bridged the gap between government and civil society, helped to strengthen platform standards for combating election-related misinformation, and shared its findings with its stakeholders, media, and the American public. This report details our process and findings, and provides recommendations for future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who We Are: EIP and Its Members</h2><p>The Election Integrity Partnership <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/news/announcing-the-eip"><span>was formed to enable real-time information exchange</span></a> between election officials, government agencies, civil society organizations, social media platforms, the media, and the research community. It aimed to identify and analyze online mis- and disinformation, and to communicate important findings across stakeholders. It represented a novel collaboration between four of the nation’s leading institutions focused on researching mis- and disinformation in the social media landscape:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public (CIP)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Graphika&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What We Did</h2><p>The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate. To identify the scope of our work, we built a <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/policy-analysis/platform-policies"><span>framework</span></a> to compare the policies of 15 social media platforms across four categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Procedural interference</em>: misinformation related to actual election procedures</p></li><li><p><em>Participation interference</em>: content that includes intimidation to personal safety or deterrence to participation in the election process</p></li><li><p><em>Fraud</em>: content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to affect the electoral process or illegally cast or destroy ballots</p></li><li><p><em>Delegitimization of election results</em>: content aiming to delegitimize election results on the basis of false or misleading claims&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The EIP used an innovative internal research structure that leveraged the capabilities of the partner organizations through a tiered analysis model based on “tickets” collected internally and from our external stakeholders. Of the tickets we processed, 72% were related to delegitimization of the election.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><h4>Misleading and false claims and narratives coalesced into the metanarrative of a “stolen election,” which later propelled the January 6 insurrection.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Right-leaning “blue-check” influencers transformed one-off stories, sometimes based on honest voter concerns or genuine misunderstandings, into cohesive narratives of systemic election fraud.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Warped stories frequently centered on mail-in voting and accusations of found, discarded, or destroyed ballots, particularly in swing states. Misleading framing of real-world incidents often took the form of falsely assigning intent, exaggerating impact, falsely framing the date, or altering locale.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The metanarrative of a “stolen election” coalesced into the #StopTheSteal movement, encompassing many of the previous narratives. The narrative appeared across platforms and quickly inspired online organizing and offline protests, leading ultimately to the January 6 rally at the White House and the insurrection at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fact-checking of narratives had mixed results; non-falsifiable narratives presented a particular challenge. In some cases, social media platform fact-checks risked drawing further attention to the claims they sought to debunk.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>The production and spread of misinformation was multidirectional and participatory.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Individuals participated in the creation and spread of narratives. Bottom-up false and misleading narratives started with individuals identifying real-world or one-off incidents and posting them to social media. Influencers and hyperpartisan media leveraged this grassroots content, assembling it into overarching narratives about fraud, and disseminating it across platforms to their large audiences. Mass media often picked up these stories after they had reached a critical mass of engagement.</p></li><li><p>Top-down mis- and disinformation moved in the opposite direction, with claims first made by prominent political operatives and influencers, often on mass media, which were then discussed and shared by people across social media properties.</p></li></ul><h4>Narrative spread was cross-platform: repeat spreaders leveraged the specific features of each platform for maximum amplification.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The cross-platform nature of misinformation content and narrative spread limited the efficacy of any single platform’s response.</p></li><li><p>Smaller, niche, and hyperpartisan platforms, which were often less moderated or completely unmoderated, hosted and discussed content that had been moderated elsewhere. Parler in particular saw a remarkable increase in its active user base, as users rejected the “censorship” they perceived on other platforms.</p></li></ul><h4>The primary repeat spreaders of false and misleading narratives were verified, blue-check accounts belonging to partisan media outlets, social media influencers, and political figures, including President Trump and his family.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>These repeat spreaders amplified the majority of the investigated incidents aggressively across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Repeat spreaders often promoted and spread each others’ content. Once content from misleading narratives entered this network, it spread quickly across the overlapping audiences.</p></li></ul><h4>Many platforms expanded their election-related policies during the 2020 election cycle. However, application of moderation policies was inconsistent or unclear.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms took action against policy violations by suspending users or removing content, downranking or preventing content sharing, and applying informational labels. However, moderation efforts were applied inconsistently on and across platforms, and policy language and updates were often unclear.</p></li><li><p>Account suspensions and content removal or labeling sometimes contributed to conspiratorial narratives that platforms were “covering up the truth,” entangling platforms with the narratives they wished to eliminate.</p></li><li><p>Lack of transparency and access to platform APIs hindered external research into the effectiveness of platform policies and interventions.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Key Recommendations</h2><h3>Federal Government</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish clear authorities and roles for identifying and countering election related mis- and disinformation. Build on the federal interagency movement toward recognizing elections as a national security priority and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Create clear standards for consistent disclosures of mis- and disinformation from foreign and domestic sources as a core function of facilitating free and fair elections, including via CISA’s Rumor Control and joint interagency statements.</p></li></ul><h3>Congress</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pass existing bipartisan proposals for increased appropriations marked for federal and state election security.</p></li><li><p>Codify the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s bipartisan recommendations related to the depoliticization of election security and the behavior of public officials and candidates for federal office noted in Volumes <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume3.pdf"><span>3</span></a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf"><span>5</span></a> of the Committee’s report on foreign influence in 2016 elections.</p></li></ul><h3>State and Local Officials</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish trusted channels of communication with voters. This should include a .gov website and use of both traditional and social media.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Ensure that all votes cast are on auditable paper records and that efficient, effective, and transparent post-election audits are conducted after each election.</p></li></ul><h3>Platforms</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Provide proactive information regarding anticipated election misinformation.

The solution could be a floating underwater rescue robot, which is intended to support rescue staff in emergencies in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>A research team from the Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB in Ilmenau developed the underwater vehicle with the help of Halle’s water rescue service, Wasserrettungsdienstes Halle e.V.

<br></p><p>According to the German life-saving association, the Deutsche Lebens-Rettungsgesellschaft (DLRG), nearly 420 people drowned in Germany in 2019, with the majority losing their lives in fresh water lakes. However, fatal accidents also occurred in swimming pools. One reason for this is the countrywide lack of trained life-guards to watch over pools. A team of researchers from the Institute for Advanced Systems Technology (AST) of Fraunhofer IOSB is aiming to improve this situation, by developing an aquatic robot, the only one of its kind worldwide. This robot will assist lifeguards and lifesavers, and rescue swimmers in emergencies. The scientists have used their years of expertise in the area of underwater robotics to develop this autonomous system. They have already designed an autonomous underwater vehicle that has won numerous awards – DEDAVE.</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a732387377c6f4194941cd5c78c56bc0/6481af0272f478b9-d6/s1280x1920/9f73e363ee978061d0915dafa1040e2de26155ee.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;During testing at the Hufeisensee lake, the dummy did not slip out of the securing mechanism as it was taken to the surface.

The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). Surveillance cameras mounted on the swimming pool’s ceiling register the movement patterns and position of the drowning person in the pool, and send the coordinates to the robot. It is safely stored away from prying eyes in a docking station on the swimming pool floor, which opens in an emergency. Once the vehicle has reached its destination, it locates the endangered person and carries them to the surface. A mechanism for fixing the rescuee in place prevents lifeless bodies from sliding down as they surface. This mechanism can also be mounted on other underwater vehicles.</p><h2><b>Successful open-water testing</b></h2><p>At swimming lakes, drones and zeppelin systems take on the task of the surveillance cameras. “These drones and advertising balloons can easily be fitted with cameras,” says Renkewitz. For rescues in swimming lakes where the visibility is restricted, the underwater vehicle must be equipped with acoustic sensors instead of optical ones. Sound wave echoes can be used to determine people’s positions and orientation so precisely that the robot can autonomously head for the target person and pick them up.</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d3f45227310c258d7b8d8e415d0b95ab/6481af0272f478b9-ce/s1280x1920/3cf1c980d7b65cec2c18ac3b4ce2186ec2f254fe.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The aquatic robot transports the dummy to shore via the shortest route.

An 80-kilogram dummy was deposited at a depth of three meters. The robot then picked it up, secured it in place, brought it to the surface within a second, and carried it via the shortest route – a distance of 40 meters – to shore, where the rescue team was already waiting. When the robot is informed of an emergency, a signal alerts the team immediately. “The full rescue operation lasted just over two minutes. Casualties must be resuscitated within five minutes to avoid long-term damages of the brain. We were able to stay within this critical time frame without any problems,” says Renkewitz.</p><h2><b>Future outlook</b></h2><p>Equipped with batteries, motor, cameras, and optical and navigational sensors, the current system is 90 centimeters long, 50 centimeters high, and 50 centimeters wide. The objective of Renkewitz’s team is to further reduce the size of the rescue system and build different versions for use in swimming pools and lakes. They aim to make it smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective than the current prototype, which is based on a pre-existing underwater vehicle. Instead, the future robot will have the streamlined design of a manta ray.</p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="843"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/dadbca97136603e8f46501046f78dbb9/6481af0272f478b9-69/s1280x1920/4427008b73e7821cdc4f9218ef3109810e950171.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="843" width="1280" height="719"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Prototype modeled on a ray - In the future, the robot will resemble the streamlined cartilaginous fish.

In modified versions, it can take on further tasks – such as offshore and dam wall inspections or being used to monitor the health of fish in fish farms. “Our underwater vehicles have a very broad range of applications. For example, they are also suitable for detecting and verifying archaeological artefacts at the bottom of lakes,” explain the researchers.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2021/march-2021/an-autonomous-underwater-robot-saves-people-from-drowning.html">Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/183243493212/drones-search-and-rescue">Autonomous drones can help search and rescue after disasters</a></p>

<p><em>March 2<sup>nd</sup> 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Today Chrome 89 ships as stable with support for <a href="https://github.com/wicg/import-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">package import maps</a> in browsers. Aligning with this support, a new <code>ga.jspm.io</code> CDN is being launched today as a native modules <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn">import map CDN</a> along with an <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online import map generator</a> for creating import maps against the module CDN.</em></p>
<h2>Import Maps Explainer</h2>
<p>Import maps allow defining the locations of modules imported from JavaScript in the browser, effectively like you would expect in any other language (and as is already supported in Node.js):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;
  <span>import</span> pkg <span>from</span> <span>'pkg'</span>;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Before import maps, if you run the above in any browser you would get the following error:</p>
<p><code><span>'Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier <span>"pkg"</span>. Relative references must start with either <span>"/"</span>, <span>"./"</span>, or <span>"../"</span>.'</span></code></p>
<p>This is because unlike other web resources, the JS modules specification for HTML reserved the space of these non-relative references (called "bare specifiers") exactly to allow custom package imports via import maps.</p>
<p>To map this specifier with an import map, we add the new <code><span>"importmap"</span></code> script type to the web page:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"importmap"</span>&gt;
{
  <span>"imports"</span>: {
    <span>"pkg"</span>: <span>"./pkg/main.js"</span>
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And as of today, the above workflow is supported natively in Chromium for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code><span>"imports"</span></code> field in the import map, there is also the <a href="https://github.com/wicg/import-maps#scoping-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code><span>"scopes"</span></code> field</a> which allows for scoping the import mapping (useful when there are naming / version conflicts). Import maps can even map entire resolved URLs which can be useful in mocking workflows.</p>
<h2>The JavaScript Module Caching Tradeoff</h2>
<p>Import maps may seem nice and all, but perhaps they don't actually seem like much of a big deal - do they really solve any production-time technical problems?</p>
<p>The answer is that they do actually solve quite a deep performance problem with JS modules in browsers!</p>
<p>Without import maps, there is a natural caching tradeoff that applies to shipping JS modules in production, something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the web you usually want all URLs to be unique and cached with far-future expires (the fastest request being no request).</li>
<li>We usually achieve this with unique URL schemes by including hashes or a unique build identifier in URLs so that updates don't cause conflicts.</li>
<li>Since modules have to import eachother by name <code>app-a09s8df0.js</code> will end up containing <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-s8df79sd.js'</span></code>, and as a result the top-level hash is dependent on the lower-level hashes. A change to a deep dependency changes the <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-s8df79sd.js'</span></code> into a <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-qw97g23s.js'</span></code>, which in turn changes the hash of <code>app-a09s8df0</code> itself because its contents have changed. That is, a deep dependency change invalidates all the parent modules. A small change causes a large invalidation.</li>
<li>So if we want to be able to have cache sharing of parent modules while invalidating dependencies, we may be better off having <code>app.js</code> load <code>dependency.js</code> and then just not using far-future expires.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is thus a complex tradeoff to be made between perfect caching that quickly invalidates with updates, and imperfect caching that might provide better cache sharing for updates.</p>
<p>In comparison to build techniques today the above might not sound so bad, but we shouldn't compare to what we do today - we should compare to the theoretical best case.</p>
<h2>Ideal Modular Caching</h2>
<p>The theoretical ideal for module caching would be for each module to be cached with far future expires, while only being invalidated when that module itself changes.</p>
<p>Import maps can provide us with exactly this property:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"importmap"</span>&gt;
{
  <span>"imports"</span>: {
    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"./dist/app-cvf98b7c.js"</span>
    <span>"dependency"</span>: <span>"./dist/dependency-s9df7987.js"</span>   
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;<span>import</span> <span>'app'</span>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>app.js</code> would contain:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'dependency'</span>;</code></pre>
<p>We now have the ability to independently update either <code>app</code> or <code>dependency</code> using the import map, while having both modules cached with far-future expires.</p>
<p><strong>Import maps bring the possibility of perfect caching for incremental updates of applications on the web.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that coupled with using dynamic <code><span>import</span>()</code> lazy loading for first-load optimization, JS modules can be a pretty good bet for production workflow performance.</p>
<h2>Module CDNs</h2>
<p>Module CDNs take the perfect caching concept and extend it based on the following principle - taking the JS package as both the unit of optimization and the unit of perfect caching.</p>
<p>For a given package and version of that package, we optimize the entire package unit as a whole and host it under a unique URL with the version number.</p>
<p>Import maps applied to this model then allow perfect caching at the level of per-package granularity. The benefit of this being that the optimized package files can be shared between any number of applications since packages are the granularity of usage. In this way it acts as a source of precompiled and optimized JS packages for the browser.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn">ga.jspm.io CDN</a> is being launched to serve this role, with import maps generated by the <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Import Map Generator</a>.</p>
<p>This effectively then provides something akin to the npm install workflow that can work natively for browsers, with the import map treated as a sort of lockfile. JSPM as a browser native package manager stems exactly from this principle.</p>
<h2>Support in Other Browsers</h2>
<p>While we wait the years it will take for import maps to be widely supported for browsers other than Chrome 89, there are two production-suitable approaches currently available:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES Module Shims</a>: A fast Wasm-based polyfill that just replaces the specifiers with their full URLs while still using the native loader. It's good enough for production in most cases and is used by the JSPM generator web application itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SystemJS</a>: A complete variant of the <code>ga.jspm.io</code> CDN is available serving <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn#systemjs-variant">SystemJS modules</a> at <code>ga.system.jspm.io</code>, available for SystemJS import maps when selecting the "SystemJS Import Map" option from the JSPM Generator. SystemJS provides a workflow where native module semantics can be replicated in all browsers using the SystemJS module fomat.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Try it Out</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun building the JSPM Generator using this approach and not having to touch a CLI apart from running a local server in dev and leaving it alone - and I really hope this can make JS development more fun for you too.</p>
<p>Please feel free to ask questions or share feedback - this stuff only works in collaboration. And there is still a lot of work to do. If you're interested in getting involved in the project please get in touch too.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/workflows">workflows here</a> or try out the <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">import map generator</a> directly.</p>

    <section>
      
      

      <p><a href="http://indie.vc/"><span>Indie.vc</span></a><span>, a firm focused on bringing startups to profitability, is shutting down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After six years and nearly 40 startups, one of Silicon Valley’s most unconventional and beloved VC firms is calling it quits, according to a </span><a href="https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09"><span>blog post</span></a><span> by founder Bryce Roberts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re proud of the work we’ve done as investors, brand builders, and movement makers,” Roberts wrote. “We love Indie!...That said, without the institutional support to scale the Indie Economy we envision, it’s time to take our learnings and refocus on other strategies within the portfolio to deploy our capital.”</span></p>
<p><span>Indie.vc became an overnight sensation in Silicon Valley after Roberts (who had been a VC himself for years) published a Tumblr post on what the firm was about back in 2015. Instead of writing founders a huge check for a seed round or a Series A, Indie would use a new investment structure, working with startups on their path to profitability. Roberts didn’t think the concept was so radical — he once told TechCrunch that profitability was more achievable than raising a Series A.</span></p>
<p><span>Indie was part of a wave of founder-friendly VC firms in that they were perceived as not relentlessly marching their investments towards land-grab markets or unicorn-scale growth as fast as possible. Rather, Roberts focused on businesses that were on a path to profitability, and could be helped to get there with an investment that allowed them to not worry so much about their next round. They wanted their investments to have some basis in reality — a product, a corporate structure, revenue — not just drawing board ideas that could either become home runs or strikeouts.</span></p>
<p><span>In this way the fund bucked the trend of most big VC firms on and off Sand Hill Road, where a few monster investments carry along a portfolio of dozens of other bets that may never pan out to a "venture scale" return.</span></p>
<p><span>Several startups to come out of Indie have remained profitable, Roberts wrote, with many generating seven figures in revenue year after year. Indie’s startup mortality rate is 10%, compared with 44% for the rest of venture capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the firm couldn’t continue without more capital from LPs, as many as 80% of whom backed out of supporting Indie. Their reasons usually had something to do with Indie’s break from the VC norm. Roberts even posted an example of the kind of LP rejection Indie often received, which said, “We are out. The shift in strategy for the fund over time (for your good, intentional reasons) has moved further away from the kinds of companies we are looking to have exposure to.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After publishing the post, Roberts tweeted about the outpouring of support he received after Indie’s demise.</span></p>
<div><p><span>“You pour yourself into something so completely for so long and then it doesn’t work out how you’d hoped and have to lay bare your failure while bracing for the worst,” Roberts wrote in a tweet.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<p><em>author: niplav, created: 2019-04-02, modified: 2020-06-01, language: english, status: in progress, importance: 3, confidence: likely</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Two people are abducted and placed on the opposite poles of a
  habitable planet. They want to find each other, but they have no
  way to communicate. The only things they know is their their own
  respective position on the planet and the position of the equator and
  the poles. Here, different methods for finding each other under similar
  conditions are explained and discussed, and a deterministic method
  for finding each other is introduced.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The original problem is taken from <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/lost_immortals_munroe_2014.pdf" title="“Lost Immortals“ (Randall
Munroe 2014)">Munroe
2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If two immortal people were placed on opposite sides of an uninhabited
  Earthlike planet, how long would it take them to find each other?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Munroe</a>, <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/lost_immortals_munroe_2014.pdf">“Lost Immortals” in “What If?”, p. 183</a>, 2014</em></p>

<p>Here, I add several clarifications to the problem.</p>

<p>For the following ideas, it is not necessary that the planet is
earth-like, but it is assumed that the planet has a relatively flat
surface, lacking oceans, where the two people can leave footprints.</p>

<p>Each of the two people has the following abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Know their own position on the planet</li>
<li>Walk at approximately the same speed</li>
<li>Reason about the other person</li>
<li>Leave footprints on the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>Both lack all other abilities, including (but not limited to) creating
new technology and communicating when they are out of sight (no fireworks,
launching spaceships etc.).</p>

<p>Both people are typical, but had no opportunity to communicate with
each other beforehand. They can reason about each others' strategy and
behavior, but have no intricate knowledge about each others decision
process (if they are artificial agents, they don't know each others'
algorithm).</p>

<p>These two people want to find each other.</p>

<h2>Different Existing Solutions</h2>

<h3>Munroes Solutions</h3>

<p>Munroe proposes different solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walk around at random: He states that they would find each other within 3000 years (though no explicit calculation is provided).</li>
<li>Agree beforehand to meet at a specific point on the planet (such as the highest mountain, one of the poles etc.).</li>
<li>Follow the coastlines of the continents. This is not applicable here, because it is assumed that there are no oceans.</li>
<li>Follow the coastlines of the continents, but after each circling, decide randomly whether to switch direction or resume the known path.</li>
<li>Walk at random, while leaving a trail of signs with increasing counter along the way, increasing ones speed when finding an unknown trail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Proposed Solutions</h3>

<p>A very similar problem was discussed in a Mathematics Stack
Exchange post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you and your friend end up on a big sphere. There are no visual
  cues on where on the sphere you both are, and the sphere is way bigger
  than you two. There are no means of communication. You can determine
  your relative position and direction by navigating the stars. You can
  move anywhere, and your friend too. <br>
  Upon inspecting the sphere, you see it is rock-solid, so you cannot
  create markings. To protect the environment, you are not allowed to
  leave other stuff, like a blood trace or breadcrumbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/53495/robau">RobAu</a>, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1214022/fastest-way-to-meet-without-communication-on-a-sphere/">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>In this problem, marking are not possible, and players don't start at
the opposite sides of the planet (which makes a solution a lot harder).</p>

<h4>Moving at Random, but Changing Directions Rarely</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Move at random. [...]
  you could prefer to walk longer distances in a straight line as opposed
  to choosing a completely new direction after every centimeter of movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/35416/mvg">MvG</a>, answer to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1214062">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>This solution does not need any prerequisites.</p>

<h4>Exhaustive Search, Moving in Spirals</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the first thing to do is to calculate the size of the sphere (by
  picking a direction and walking until you arrive back at the start point
  or some other, more efficient technique). At that point, you can work out
  an exhaustive search pattern and the duration to perform one (a spiral
  pattern is close to optimal but difficult for a human to perform). That
  duration becomes your frequency of decision making.
  Once per period, you flip a coin. Heads, you do an exhaustive
  search. Tails, you stay put. Each of the longer period (e.g. the less
  efficient search pattern), you have a 50/50 chance of doing the opposite
  of your partner and thus discovering each other in the course of the
  exhaustive search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/221242/danikov">Danikov</a>, answer to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1214323">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>This is similar to the strategy of randomly switching positions, but
without opposite starting positions. It assumes one can adequately
calculate the circumference of the sphere, which is not a given, and it
assumes that the person can generate random bits.</p>

<h4>Randomizing Speed While Keeping Direction</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think a better strategy is to pick a direction (any will do), stick
  to it and randomise your speed. <br>
  If both parties do this their paths will cross twice each orbit (unless
  they are on the same orbit in which case they will meet sooner due to
  randomised speed) <br>
  if you go full random changing direction as well as velocity you aren't
  guaranteed to ever cross the path of the other. (although as t gets large
  it becomes increasingly likely that your paths will cross at least once.) <br>
  Speed randomisation is necessary to avoid never meeting because of resonance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Find a Schelling Point</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would posit that a better-than-random solution would include finding
  the most "interesting" such configuration (so first you have to map
  them all by traveling the sphere methodically) and heading there as a
  Schelling point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/54545/qwertronix">Qwertronix</a>, answer to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1214322">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>This solution is similar to most practical solutions to these kinds
of problems. It assumes that there <em>is</em> a most interesting star
configuration, the size of such a configuration, and a given metric
on how to determine the interesting-ness of such a configuration.
The metric is the least difficult of them: given a size of the region
of sky, the most interesting such region would be the one that is the
most compressible (or most regular). The size aspect of this possible
configuration is much more difficult: Where does such a configuration
end? One possible answer is: "At the horizon.", then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)">Schelling
point</a> would
be the point where the whole sky is most interesting.</p>

<h3>Randomly Switching Positions</h3>

<p>Another solution is possible due to the fact that both people start out
at the opposite sides of the planet. Each person determines randomly
whether they should travel to the opposite side of the planet or stay
at ones own side for the duration of such a travel. This drastically
decreases the time until meeting, since the chance of not having met after
n such iterations the chance of having met is <code>$1-\frac{1}{2^n}$</code>. Munroe
proposes coin flips to determine whether one changes position, but one
can imagine other such methods if coins are not available.</p>

<p>One could assign the choice of staying to the left body half and
the choice of going to the other side of the planet to the right
body half, and then choosing the strategy based on which part of the
body itches first. This would be useful since humans are notoriously
bad at consciously generating random bits (see <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/two_people_on_a_planet/humans_cannot_consciously_generate_random_numbers_sequences_figurska_et_al_2008.pdf" title="Humans cannot consciously generate random numbers sequences: Polemic study">Figurska et al.
2007</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, this method could be biased, since many humans have
points on their skin that are constantly itchy.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>A better solution is possible because both people start out at the
opposite sides of the planet, and know their own respective position on
the planet.</p>

<p>Taking their own position as one pole, they could infer an equator as
the set of points on the planet that is equally far away from each of
their positions. They would then both proceed to go to this equator
and start walking along it.</p>

<p><img src="https://niplav.github.io/img/two_people_on_a_planet/sphere.png" alt="Two agents move to the equator of a sphere" title="Two agents move to the equator of a sphere. They both start at opposing poles of the planet."></p>

<p>Then each person could follow the following algorithm: If they had
walked less than half of the circumference of the planet, and encountered
footsteps, they would reverse direction. If they had walked more than
half of the circumference of the planet, they would continue walking no
matter whether they would see other footsteps on the ground.</p>

<p>This would ensure that they would deterministically meet in <code>$\cal{O}(n)$</code>
(<code>$n$</code> being the circumference of the planet).</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>

<p>This code does not deal with the possibility that the other agent doesn't
use the same method, or that they don't arrive at the equator at the
same time.</p>

<pre><code>circumference=4*walk_to_equator() /* circumference in steps */

set_marker() /* in case footsteps are not visible after some time */
equator_steps=0

while met_person()==false
    walk_step()
    equator_steps++
    if marker_visible==true and steps_on_equator&lt;circumference/2
        turn_around()
</code></pre>

<h2>Why it Works</h2>

<p>Here, it is assumed that they both reach the equator at the same time.</p>

<p>If both start walking towards each other, the algorithm succeeds:
Both can walk at most half of the length of the equator upon meeting
each other in the extreme case, namely, starting back to back and not
realizing it. In this case, the last part of the method is not applied,
because both will walk less than half of the length of the equator in
any case. In this case, finding each other takes at most <code>$\frac{3}{4}$</code>
of the time it takes to walk across the whole equator (including the
walk from the starting point to the equator).</p>

<p>If they both start walking in the same direction, the method still
succeeds: one of the two people has a distance of less than half of the
length of the equator to the starting point of the other person.</p>

<p>Hello. It’s me, <em>Artist Formerly Known As Lead Maintainer of <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam">Foam</a></em>.</p>

<p>You may remember me from such hits as “feverishly astroturfing a community around an early-stage open source project and then disappearing into the thin air without any kind of acknowledgement that anything had ever happened.”</p>

<p>This is that acknowledgement, followed by some thoughts about the future of Foam.</p>

<p>I’ve organized this article in three parts, so that if you don’t have time to read the whole thing, you can jump to the part that interests you the most:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="#present">Present</a></strong>, where we look at the current state of Foam.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#past">Past</a></strong>, where I offer a personal account of my involvement, and subsequent non-involvement, in Foam, and hopefully learn something for the third act.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#future">Future</a></strong>, where we discuss what could be ahead for Foam.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="present">Present</h2>

<p>Presently, I don’t presume to have any control over the Foam project.</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t presume to be able to speak for the project at all. In my absence, <a href="https://github.com/riccardoferretti">Riccardo Ferretti</a>, who was one of the first people to contribute to Foam, has stepped in as the project’s lead maintainer. Since October, he’s improved Foam massively by his own code contributions, while also coordinating the work of others. By this point, Riccardo has put as much work into the project as I have, and as such has very much earned the right to speak for it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Riccardo and I reconnected, and we’ve discovered our experiences maintaining Foam have been in many ways similar. In fact, in the previous paragraphs, when I’ve been using the first-person plural pronoun “we”, it hasn’t been just a rhetorical device. This piece was co-authored by Riccardo and I, and together, as the author and the maintainer of the project, we can proudly say:</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining Foam sucks.</strong></p>

<p>I initially created Foam with the goal of building the best networked note taking app. Right now it’s not even the best networked note taking extension installed in my VS Code. This might seem like a technical problem, but in our experience, the root cause is fundamentally organizational.</p>

<p><strong>The way we’ve ran the Foam project is not productive in the short term, and not sustainable in long term.</strong></p>

<p>We both want to make Foam better in the <a href="#future">future</a>, and we have some ideas on how to get there. But before we get to it, I want to take a self-indulgent detour to the past, and tell you how I came to walk away from Foam last September.</p>

<h2 id="past">Past</h2>

<p>Here’s a quick timeline of my personal involvement in Foam</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the 19th of June 2020, I made the first commit to what was going to become Foam.</li>
  <li>One week later, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jevakallio/status/1276098596111290370">launched publicly on Twitter</a>. By the end of that week, Foam held the #1 position on Hacker News, Product Hunt, <strong>and</strong> GitHub, which brought in a lot of attention to a project that was not set up to receive it.</li>
  <li>By early July I was working 16 hour days between Foam and my day job. I was also receiving daily calls from major venture capital firms who wanted to invest into turning Foam into the Next Big Thing in personal note-taking.</li>
  <li>By early August, I decided that I wanted to build Foam into a best-in-class product, but do it on my own terms. So I said <em>fuck you</em> to the man, quit my job, declined all investment offers, and planned to transition to working on Foam full-time on September 1st.</li>
  <li>On September 1st, I simply couldn’t get out of bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>So when people ask, why did you stop working on Foam, the answer is easy: <strong>I had no choice in the matter</strong>. Almost overnight I went from wanting to spend my every waking hour working on Foam, to not being able to pick up my laptop and look at another pull request or Discord message.</p>

<p>Except it didn’t really happen overnight. In retrospect, towards the end of the summer my manic working schedule had itself become a type of raging against the dying of the light. The surest recipe for burnout is getting stuck in a loop where you have to expend increasing amounts of effort for diminishing returns. Every day you feel like you have to work harder, because the day before you didn’t achieve what you set out to do.</p>

<p>Burnout is a devious disease, because it becomes the filter through which you see the world. With Foam, I was building a Second Brain to store my knowledge, but what I needed was a second brain to observe my first malfunctioning brain, and tell it that it needs help.</p>

<p>It’s almost embarrassing to admit to having burned out on open source. When you burn out in your corporate career, you can shake your fist at capitalism, and people can relate. But open source?</p>

<p><em>“You did <strong>what</strong> mate? You turned a fun hobby into a responsibility and spiralled into catatonic depression over a few GitHub stars? Good job!”</em></p>

<p>As a maintainer of a popular open source project, it’s hard not to feel the weight of the collective expectations of the users, contributors and spectators of your project on your shoulders.</p>

<p>This is not a complaint about “entitled users”: Whether or not any individual contributor actually asks for your time, attention or care, you feel indebted to give it to them all. Well, I don’t know about you. I did, anyway.</p>

<p>Which finally brings us to something resembling a point:</p>

<p>An open source project can become just as toxic and stressful as a corporate workplace, when it’s poorly managed. <strong>I ended up leaving Foam because I had created a fundamentally unsustainable environment and then tried to sustain it until I no longer could.</strong></p>

<h3 id="dynamics-of-open-source">Dynamics of Open Source</h3>

<p>In her excellent book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54140556-working-in-public">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">Nadia Eghbal</a> categorizes open source projects into four categories: federations, stadiums, clubs, and toys.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>High User Growth</th>
      <th>Low User Growth</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>High Contributor Growth</strong></td>
      <td>Federations <em>e.g. Rust</em></td>
      <td>Clubs <em>e.g. Astropy</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Low Contributor Growth</strong></td>
      <td>Stadiums <em>e.g. Babel</em></td>
      <td>Toys <em>e.g. ssh-chat</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What I wanted Foam to be was a <strong>Federation</strong>: A Populous, plentiful ecosystem, packed with diverse ideas loosely affiliated projects that would scale without central bottlenecks. Instead it became a <strong>Stadium</strong>, with a bunch of people running from the rafters onto the field trying to kick the ball to the direction they thought it should.</p>

<p>Where we ended up was the worst of both worlds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By our own principles, we decried central governance, and therefore gave up the ability to draw a box around of what Foam is and isn’t.</li>
  <li>Because we lacked a cohesion of ideas, we weren’t able to build infrastructure on top of which people could build their individual, decentralized projects while remaining interoperable.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were trying to build an infinitely large platform in the middle of a ever-shifting ocean of ideas</p>

<p>For this project to ever reach its stated goals, this will have to change.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>When I wrote Foam’s <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles">Principles</a>, the goal was to build a software platform that would make it easier for people to solve their own problems, while contributing to a shared commons that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>What I’ve since learned is that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Freedom</strong> does not mean anyone is free to introduce ideas and features that significantly change the scope of the project and we should simply accept them, or try our best to fit them in our vision.</li>
  <li><strong>Openness</strong> does not mean we should accept low-quality contributions that increase the maintenance burden of the project, because in most cases, the contributor is not going to stick around to maintain it, and that burden will fall on us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every successful software abstraction creates value by defining a set way of doing things, and provides tools to achieve them. In order to do this, they also define what is not possible within this abstraction.</p>

<p>Because we didn’t understand this early on, Foam quickly became a collection of loosely affiliated projects, ideas and approaches to note taking, sometimes incompatible with each other — far from the platform we envisioned.</p>

<p>To fix this, we have to draw some lines in the sand, so that we can make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Foam, the product” better in the short term,</li>
  <li>“Foam, the project” more feasible to develop in the medium term, and</li>
  <li>“Foam, the community” more sustainable for its maintainers and users in the long term</li>
</ul>

<p>Riccardo and I have compared what we’ve learned, and we have decided to join forces to work on the following approaches.</p>

<h3 id="refocus">Refocus</h3>

<p>Going forward, we want to be more intentional about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What Foam really is (and isn’t)</li>
  <li>Who Foam is for (and who it isn’t for)</li>
  <li>Which use cases Foam caters for (and which it unapologetically does not)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the end of this journey, <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam">foambubble/foam</a> will be a leaner, and more centralized project.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Some features will move to their own, officially-unsupported repositories, where anyone who deeply cares about them may adopt them.</li>
  <li>Others features, that belong to the bucket of what “Foam isn’t”, may be killed outright.</li>
  <li>We will kill the defunct <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/rfcs">RFC</a> process (it was never <em>really</em> there anyway).</li>
  <li>We will also update the project’s documentation and contribution guidelines to be clearer on what types of contributions will be welcome to Foam’s core.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a closing of the gates. Quite the opposite. What we want to do is to build the infrastructure of the commons.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-of-the-commons">Infrastructure of The Commons</h3>

<p>The stated goal of Foam has not changed. <strong>What we want is to enable <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> and its community of people to more effectively solve their own problems, explore a constellation of ideas, and contribute them back to a commons.</strong></p>

<p>That requires being more than glue. It requires becoming a solid platform, and in order to do this, we’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bring core features in-house</strong>, to provide a strong networked note taking experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Open the Foam API</strong> so that third-party extensions can build on top of the Foam knowledge graph model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, we’ve co-managed document linking and data visualization with other extensions, but for Foam to be able to build on top of its own platform, we need to reduce the amount of Lowest Common Denominator constraints set by supporting the projects and their nuances.</p>

<p>The next major evolution Foam will no longer require you to install other extensions for document linking and navigation. We aim to provide a more coherent …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-560368d843630fd9268b"><div><p>In my current role, I spend the bulk of my day interacting with CTOs who are hiring engineers and learning about their companies, engineering philosophies, and specific gaps in their team. I know a lot about the universe of potential jobs that exist for engineers at a per company, per role level, but ultimately almost nothing about if a particular individual should accept a particular job offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Every day, I talk to at least one engineer who’s deciding if a startup job offer is right for them. And every day I point them towards a decision-making framework they can use, inspired by the Commit team’s experience choosing roles, as well as by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokulrajaram1/"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-de-beer-a9091b1/"><span>Marius de Beer</span></a>.</p><p>Gokul Rajaram is a software engineer, former startup CEO, has led product at Square and DoorDash, sits on the board of The Trade Desk, Pinterest and Coinbase, and an investor/advisor to dozens of companies, including Poshmark. He is also Commit’s go-to-resource for running great All Hands meetings. <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul sat down with Commit in October</span></a> to share his thoughts on today’s challenges and opportunities for startups.</p><p>Marius de Beer is a mechanical and software engineer, with a decade of experience as an agile coach. He is also Commit’s go-to-resource for setting company values.</p><h2><strong>A Framework for deciding on a startup job offer</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Is a startup the right choice for you?</strong></h3><p>There is a startup subculture that can make it feel like the obvious best option - Hacker News, TechCrunch, Twitter, etc cover startups with excitement and a sense of possibility that a public company doesn’t always receive. This atmosphere provides a valuable sense of meaning and camaraderie for startup employees, but it doesn’t mean that joining a startup is the absolute best decision.</p><p>Ask yourself, how important is stability in both your role and your company? Are you looking to optimize your cash compensation number? How much do you value work-life balance and boundaries? If those things are very important to you, you likely would prefer a more mature company (<a href="https://visible.vc/blog/startup-funding-stages/"><span>series C or later</span></a>). But if those are less important to you than growth, autonomy and creativity, then you aren’t likely to feel that you’re making a sacrifice by joining a startup.</p><p>You should think about compensation as more than just the base cash salary. The earlier stage company you join, the more your potential equity could be worth. You have to determine for yourself if you’re willing to sacrifice some base cash salary today for potential equity growth down the road. And regardless of how important compensation is to you, “you must ensure that the total compensation in a role lets you take care of yourself and your family.”&nbsp; - Marius de Beer</p><p>No startup is worth putting yourself into debt for.</p><h3><strong>2. Is the team not just VC-backable, but a group that you will thrive working with?</strong></h3><p>As an ex-VC, I felt a bit guilty realizing there were companies that I would invest in, but not work at. However, I realized that each of us have unique cultural attributes and personality traits, which companies similarly embody. I think it is table stakes to believe in management and their ability to lead and to like and respect the people with whom you will work alongside. But those factors alone don’t tell you if a company’s culture and values align with you, and will set you up to thrive.</p><p>We’ve built a list of attributes at Commit that we score engineers and companies against - you may find it helpful to see which attributes are core to your personality, and look for those attributes in the job descriptions and values of companies that you’re considering.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You are motivated by autonomy and independence</p></li><li><p>You feel a deep responsibility for code quality</p></li><li><p>You are customer-obsessed</p></li><li><p>You are most concerned with</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Business context informing product decisions;</p></li><li><p>Stability and performance;</p></li><li><p>Solving hard technical problems; or</p></li><li><p>Beautiful design;&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You do best in opinionated, debate-heavy cultures versus you do best in organizations with clear top-down decision making</p></li><li><p>You prefer to work asynchronously via written communication versus you prefer to work through conversation</p></li><li><p>You want to lead and grow teams versus you want time and space to do your best work as an individual contributor</p></li><li><p>You thrive during setbacks and moments of transition versus you prefer to be insulated from shocks</p></li><li><p>Work is a source of identity to you</p></li><li><p>You want to hone your craft versus you are energized by exposure to unfamiliar technical patterns, systems, or languages</p></li></ul><p>Regardless of these values, you should look for a team that is mission-oriented. A founder who embodies a mission has a deeply held conviction about why the company exists, what it aims to accomplish, and whom it helps. They emote this in their communication and - most importantly - they use the mission as a litmus test for tough decisions.</p><p>“When you talk to a CEO, you need to understand why they’re leading this type of company, and do they really believe in the mission themselves? Do they epitomize the mission? If you talked to Larry [Page], who was the CEO when I joined Google, you could see how deeply he believed in the mission. He was Mr. Search. He believed deeply in technology and investing in deep technology.” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>3. Does this role advance your personal and career growth goals?</strong></h3><p>Your goals may be related to power, title, scope of work (ie. moving into a manager track or staying on the IC path), learning, creativity, and agency. Determine where you see yourself in 1, 3 and 5 years, and ask yourself if this role takes you closer to those goals or farther away.</p><p>Marius de Beer’s framework is to ask yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>What do you want to accomplish and see on your EP/LinkedIn profile in 18 months’ time? Describe it in a short paragraph.</p></li><li><p>Now, imagine you put that statement at the centre of a mind map. List below the possible success factors to achieve that statement. In other words, how would you know if you were successful at achieving this goal? Prioritize this list.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What are the necessary pre-conditions to achieve those items? Again, prioritize this list. Be clear with the people who offer you the new opportunity that these pre-conditions exist - otherwise you will not be successful.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>4. Are you excited to wake up every day and think about this problem space?</strong></h3><p>This applies even if you realized through question two that work is not a source of identity to you. Every day you will wake up to a new problem that must be solved. Do you like thinking about the problem? Is it satisfying when a breakthrough pops into your head in the shower or is it an intrusion? Will this company have an impact on an issue that is important to you? Are you interested in the product/service, or empathetic towards those who are interested in it?</p><p>Everyone will have a different philosophy on how important this problem space must be to them. Some will only want to work in an industry that is their most important issue. (Those people often start companies so you can expect this to be the most important problem space to the founders!)</p><p>“On the mission side, I realized that missions that resonate with me are the missions that are fairly universal and broad. At Google, the mission is around making information democratized and accessible. At Facebook it was around connecting the world. At Square it was around making commerce easy and helping small and medium-sized businesses and individuals—economically empowering them.” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>5. Do you believe that the company will succeed?</strong></h3><p>Everyone has a different tolerance for how much the company must have succeeded to date, but you will want to have confidence that the company can succeed. There are simple signals like credibility with customers and notable partners, or performance against commonly accepted metrics.</p><p>“To judge if a company is on the right path, I really try to understand the business model and know what metrics to look for. Andreessen Horowitz has a good resource for different types of business models - <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/"><span>https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/</span></a>.” - Thomas Zhou, Graduated Engineering Partner.</p><p>“I’m a big fan of Amy Hoy’s techniques about uncovering customer pain and studying a market (going from pain to product).&nbsp; The business team should deeply understand the market you’re in, the pains your audience experiences, and what they care about/how they solve their problems. That should guide every product decision.” - Thiago Araujo, Graduated Engineering Partner.</p><p>If you’re evaluating a very early-stage startup, there may not be any metrics or business traction at all. This is when you can lean on the founders, why they found the problem worth solving, and what is motivating them to build this company (a good answer is ‘to solve the problem’, while a worrying answer is ‘for the glory of being a CEO’).</p><p>“My ideal scenario is finding founders who come from the space the company is trying to solve a problem for. They were the ones who ran into the problem in their day-to-day and found that it was worthwhile enough to quit their jobs and start a company to solve it.” - Hai Hoang, Graduated Engineering Partner</p><p>“The most successful startups have a founder with a unique and non-obvious insight on this market.” You’ll know within an hour of speaking with them - ‘Aha!’ that’s the non-obvious insight about the market!” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>6. Marius de Beer’s Final Test. Do you say 'yes' or 'no'?</strong></h3><p>Imagine you walk into the office of your current boss to tell them you are leaving. You haven't signed the new offer at this point so there's no legal or ethical conflict. Their response is to say to you: “I’ll give you everything you’ve been offered and everything that you want out of that new job”. Do you say 'Yes' or 'No'?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes? You're not ready to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>No? It’s time to go make a difference somewhere else.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmarion/"><span><em>Sarah Marion</em></span></a><em> leads Founder Partnerships at Commit. She’s spent her career collaborating with early stage founders as they solve valuable problems.</em></p><p><strong>We hire Software Engineers to build their careers with promising early-stage startups. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>One summer I was staying in a hotel in the coastal North African town of Hammamet. My first evening there, and while I was in the lobby, I met a Saudi Arabian chemistry professor drinking a beer and surfing the web using an <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/8thgenerationipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPad</a>. We talked and it turned out we shared some interests. One of these was politics. As we progressed in our chitchat one question popped up into my mind—one that I’d been curious about and more curious hearing a Saudi’s opinion on the issue. So, in the middle of the conversation, I threw at him a question: “Don’t you think that one day Iran and Saudi Arabia would be strong allies, the way Israel and America are, collaborating with each other militarily and economically? I can’t stop thinking how the Middle East would look like if they do so, and more importantly, who’s best interest is served when Saudi Arabia and Iran always stay in conflict?”<br>&nbsp;The guy was surprised by the question thrown at him, and he simply ignored the possibility. “Why not, “I thought to myself. I still think about the possibility to this day. You may say that it’s not possible because of “history”. Well history is in the making as long as the world and mankind coexist. When The Suez Canal Company built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suez Canal</a> in the late 19th century, history changed. The same thing happened when the US built <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal" target="_blank">The Panama Canal</a>. Both Canals altered geography and history—in that same order.</p>



<blockquote><p>Sustainable peace and security require good bilateral relations and regional cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh. Iran and Saudi Arabia have significant differences, but they share common interests in many critical issues, such as energy security, nuclear nonproliferation, and Middle East stability.</p><cite>Hossein Mousavian, author of <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/bookhosseinmousavianiranandus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iran and the United States: An Insider’s View on the Failed Past and the Road to Peace</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>As I am writing this in my daily journal, Biden, and after 5 weeks inside the White House, has just announced more American sanctions on Russia (Because of an attempted Alexei Navalny assassination by poisoning). He has just bombed Iranian targets in Syria (while trying to negotiate with Iran). He is also putting more and more pressure on Saudi Arabia after The US Intelligence came to the conclusion—one that was intentionally communicated to the public—that Mohammed Bin Salman (aka MBS) was the one pulling the strings, orchestrating the Jamal Kashuqgi’s murder in Turkey, an event that neither journalists nor the people of Istanbul will ever forget.</p>



<p>Nothing is impossible in politics. But, it seems the possibility of Iran and Saudi Arabia becoming regional allies, getting together, and going over all the conflicts of the past, is unlikely to happen in the near future—though I think it is still possible, under the right circumstances.</p>

          <p>Sorry for not replying, Rob, I was super busy with fixing things. This is purely a technical problem, not a financial one, which is kind of how I got into the situation. So far, I was always able to fix things just by renting more servers, but that is now no longer effective and AcoustID needs bigger changes.</p>
<p>The service is now partially restored, but heavily rate-limited at least for the next week or so, until I manage to separate some parts of the backend.</p>

        <p>I’ve increased the rate limits, as things seem more stable now, but I’m seeing nowhere near the amount of traffic I was seeing before the incident, so something must be still wrong. If the service is not working for you, please let me know and I’ll try to find out why it’s not working.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-22291">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>With the exception of exchanges, scammers, YouTube channels and news sites full of filler and ads, and whales like Michael Saylor, it would seem hardly anyone is making money with cryptocurrency. Despite Bitcoin going from $10k to $40k in less than two months, one is still hard-pressed to find many success stories or evidence of ordinary people getting rich buying and holding or trading crypto. A few days ago I scanned the popular Reddit subs r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency for posts of people who had made sizable sums of money with crypto, and I only found two: someone who had bought a $10,000 Omega watch with their crypto gains, and someone else who made $63,000. Sure, this is better than nothing , but not exactly life-changing amounts of money, especially given how well Bitcoin has done over the past year. By contract, on /r/wallstreetbets there are pages up pages of people making hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars seemingly effortlessly with stock options and with buy and hold. Sure, some on /r/wallstreetbets lose a fortune too, but even in spite of large losses, it would seem that there is far more wealth to be made with stock trading compared to cryptocurrency. It is not even close. I had to dig through dozens of pages to find even just a handful of people who had made a sizable amount of money with crypto, whereas on /r/wallstreetbets it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>Where are the millionaires? Surely there must be some. This is not to say that no one has gotten rich with crypto. There are people who bought Bitcoin from 2010-2013 and are sitting on large fortunes. But one would think that there would be dozens of posts every week from newly-minted crpyto millionaires bragging about their gains. One explanation is that bragging this incurs the risk of having your funds stolen, but it is not like you can break into someone’s cold storage wallet from a Reddit account. I imagine that anyone with a fortune would know how to share a screenshot or make a post without compromising their crypto.</p>
<p>So why has crypto been such a loser despite the bull market over the past 2 years, especially compared to stocks? Why aren’t people making money with crypto, but stock trading millionaires are a dime a dozen? There are several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Crypto has too much volatility and hence poor risk-adjusted returns compared to stocks. Whereas many stocks and indexes tend to exhibit a gentle rising slope over the duration of the post-2009 bull market, punctuated by a deep but brief dip due to Covid, crypto tends to zig and zag unpredictably. This is bad for many reasons: too much volatility makes it harder, psychologically, to stay in the market without panic selling at a loss or taking profits too soon. Although bitcoin may have higher absolute returns compared to the Nasdaq , the volatility is considerably higher. This also makes it harder to apply leverage strategies, further minimizing returns. If the Nasdaq has 25% annual returns but 10% draw-downs vs. 50% returns for Bitcoin but 30% drawdowns, you can use 4-1 leverage on the Nasdaq and make 100% in a year with a 40% maximum draw-down, but even applying 2-1 leverage on Bitcoin will give you 100% return but a 60% maximum draw-down. Clearly, stocks provide better risk-adjusted returns with leverage.</p>
<p>Leveraged stock strategies such as buying and holding 3x ETFs such as FNGU,TQQQ, and TECL, have outperformed Bitcoin since 2018. In early 2018, when Bitcoin was at $12k or so, I recommended FNGU as an alternative to Bitcoin (as a sort of high-risk but high return investment). Three years later, FNGU is up over 500% vs. 350% for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>2. No options market with crypto. Stock options allow small returns of the underlying index or stock to be magnified, but options trading is still very limited with crypto. It is possible, but it does not work nearly as well as stock option trading.</p>
<p>3. Too hard and cumbersome to deposit and withdrawal large sums of and crypto and or fiat. Even after 911, given all of the Patriot Act restrictions, I found it very easy to deposit money in a brokerage account and begin trading. All I had to do was wire money to the broker and within 3 days I was able to trade. With crypto, often you need ID cards and proof of funds due to various arbitrary compliance and anti-money laundering restrictions and regulations. Prior to 2017, it was easy to transfer funds and crypto in and out of exchanges, but criminals inevitably abused and exploited the good will of exchanges. That is usually what happens with these sort of things: all it takes is a few bad actors to permanently ruin it for everyone else. Two decades later, we still have to take off our shoes at the airport because someone had the brilliant idea of smuggling a bomb in their shoe.</p>
<p>4. Too small of position sizes. On /r/wallstreetbets it is not uncommon to see traders in their 20s or 30s make bets of ten thousand dollars or more on a single option trade. Yet for some reason with crypto everyone is skinflint and risk averse. It’s like “I deposited $50 into my Coinbase” is the norm. You’re not going to get rich with such as small investment even if Bitcoin goes up 100x. It is the same age group and demographic buying stock as buying crypto, so it’s not like the crypto traders should have less money.</p>
<p>5. Gains do not hold. GME stock started at $3 in 2020 and a year later is still above $100. Stocks tend to ‘trend’ which means that past price movement predicts future direction. If a stock has risen 70 out of the past 100 days, likely it will keep rising, at least for the foreseeable future. This is known as momentum, and there is evidence that in spite of the efficient market hypothesis, that it exists. With crypto, sometimes an altcoin will get pumped 100% in a day and then the next day give up most of its gains, and then a week later be back to where it started. It is hard to make money off that because there is no follow-through or trend to ride higher. It s not like Gsamestock, which kept going up for many months, or, like Tesla, which went from $70 to $900 over 2 years.</p>
<p>6. As discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-good-investment/">earlier</a>, crypto is more like a commodity than a stock. Whereas stocks tend to generate shareholder value in the form of retained earnings, dividends, or buybacks, crypto does not generate earnings that can be passed on to investors. Also, crypto has more inflation than stocks, as some inflation (between 2-5%) is built into crypto protocols, whereas with stocks the supply tends to shrink over time due to buybacks. Historically, for these reasons, commodities tend to have far worse returns than stocks.</p>

<p>You've installed Linux (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) into an UEFI bhyve guest on FreeBSD, only to be greeted with a message about PXE boot after restarting from the installer:</p>

<p>BdsDxe: failed to load Boot0001 "UEFI BHYVE SATA DISK BHYVE-48FF-992B-D5E0" from PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x4,0x0)/Sata(0x0,0xFFFF,0x0): Not Found<br>&gt;&gt;Start PXE over IPv4.</p>

<p>This article will describe what happened, and show you how to fix this and similar issues. I'll assume that you've started the virtual machine using the bhyve command and are familiar with its various options (see <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><code>man 8 bhyve</code></a>).</p>

<p>In the message above, the UEFI firmware could not find an EFI bootloader, so it is attempting to perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">network boot</a>. To skip this and simplify debugging, restart the bhyve virtual machine without a network adapter. You'll be greeted by the UEFI shell:</p>

<a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/bhyve-efi-shell.png"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/bhyve-efi-shell.png" alt="bhyve UEFI shell: UEFI Interactive Shell EDK II mapping table"></a>

<p>Our goal is to find the EFI bootloader file that the firmware could not locate.</p>

<p>Helpfully, the EFI shell lists all of the storage devices and partitions that it could find. There will usually be at least two partitions on the Linux virtual machine's hard drive: the first, a small partition holding EFI firmware, the second, the Linux system. In this case, the EFI partition is <code>FS0</code> (listed as "<code>HD1(1,GPT,</code>…" i.e. the first GPT partition of the first drive) the main Linux partition is <code>BLK2</code> (listed as "<code>HD1(2,GPT,</code>…" i.e. the second GPT partition of the first drive). <code>BLK0</code> is the drive itself (not considering the partition table) and <code>BLK3</code> here is the swap partition.</p>

<p>We can navigate into a filesystem by typing its name, followed by a colon. From there, familiar commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>rm</code> will be available. Let's see what was installed to the EFI partition:</p>
<p>
<span>Shell&gt;</span><span>FS0:</span><br>
<span>FS0:\&gt;</span><span>ls</span><br>
<span>Directory of: </span><span>FS0:\</span><br>
<span>03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;EFI<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Dir(s)</span><br>
<span>FS0:\&gt;</span><span>cd EFI</span><br>
<span>FS0:\EFI\&gt;</span><span>ls</span><br>
<span>Directory of: </span><span>FS0:\EFI\</span><br>
<span>03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br>
03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;..<br>
03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;debian<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Dir(s)</span><br>
</p>

<p>Aha! The UEFI firmware expects to find the bootloader in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/f1567720b13a578ffa54716119f826df622babcd/MdePkg/Include/Uefi/UefiSpec.h#L2209"><code>EFI/boot</code></a>, not in <code>EFI/debian</code>. Typically, bootloader paths would be set as UEFI variables, but <code>bhyve</code> is unable to store these between reboots.</p>

<p>The easiest way to start the Linux guest from here is to execute the EFI bootloader inside the <code>debian</code> folder:</p>

<p>
<span>FS:\EFI\&gt;</span><span>cd debian</span><br>
<span>FS:\EFI\debian\&gt;</span><span>grubx64.efi</span><br>
</p>

<p>Boot should now continue normally.</p>

<p>How can you avoid having to manually run the bootloader from the EFI shell? Here are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reinstall <code>grub</code> under the prefix that the UEFI firmware expects. From within the Linux guest, <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/grub2/blob/master/util/grub-install.c#L295">you can run</a> <code>grub-install --bootloader-id=boot</code> to install to <code>EFI/boot</code> instead of <code>EFI/debian</code>. You'll probably have to rename <code>grubx64.efi</code> to <code>bootx64.efi</code> as well (often, the EFI partition will be mounted by default at <code>/boot/EFI</code>).</li>
  <li>Don't use UEFI boot, rather, use <code>grub2-bhyve</code> to boot using MBR / legacy boot.</li>
  <li>Use software like <a href="https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve">vm-bhyve</a> to handle the details for you.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-11964"><!-- .entry-header --><div> <p><em>Estimated read time (minus contemplative pauses): <span><span></span> <span> 47</span> <span></span></span> min.</em></p><h2>Introduction: Zero Existence</h2><p>In a fun episode on one of my favorite podcasts, <em>Elucidations</em> (<a href="https://elucidations.now.sh/posts/episode-42-agustin-rayo-discusses-the-construction-of-logical-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 42, 12/12/12</a>), philosopher Agustín Rayo argues that the number zero exists independently of human thought and behavior.</p><p>I like his argument. And it’s simple enough, I think, to get the gist of it across in a blog post.</p><p>To do that, I’ll draw from his 2014 paper, “<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/96869">Nominalism, Trivialism, Logicism</a>” (the argument also appears, with more detail, in his 2013 book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ag3F8O">The Construction of Logical Space</a></em>, which I haven’t read). I found the paper to be playful and challenging. His writing is clear and his enthusiasm for these difficult topics is contagious; no surprise after hearing him on <em>Elucidations</em>.</p><p>This is not to say that I’ve been converted by Rayo’s argument, which can be extended to account for all natural numbers. I remain a <em>mathematical nominalist</em>—that is, someone who does not believe in the independent existence of numbers (or any other mathematical objects). This is in contrast to a&nbsp;<em>platonist</em>, who does believe in the independent existence of numbers (and perhaps other mathematical objects).</p><p>Actually, Rayo’s argument suggests what he calls a “subtle” platonism. But before getting into that, I’d like to say a little more about the nominalist–platonist divide—or, more precisely, about where I stand with respect to it.</p><p>It’s common, by the way, to see the word “Platonism” capitalized. I follow the standard of not capitalizing in this context, as contemporary mathematical platonism is usually significantly removed from Plato’s theory of eternal forms—e.g., Plato’s forms have causal powers, while the mathematical platonist’s abstract objects usually don’t.</p><p>That said, people use the terms in these discussions in sometimes very different ways. I’ll do my best to navigate the discursive terrain without becoming misled, bogged down, or lost in its many rabbit holes (though I’ll links some nice entryways into those rabbit holes).</p><h2>Nominalism versus Platonism about Mathematics (Or: Why I’m not a Platonist)</h2><p>In his paper, Rayo describes a common challenge posed to mathematical nominalists:</p><blockquote><p>Mathematical Nominalism is the view that there are no mathematical objets. A standard problem for nominalists is that it is not obvious that they can explain what the point of a mathematical assertion would be. For it is natural to think that mathematical sentences like ‘the number of the dinosaurs is zero’ or ‘1 + 1 = 2’ can only be true if mathematical objects exist. But if this is right, the nominalist is committed to the view that such sentences are untrue. And if the sentences are untrue, it not immediately obvious why they would be worth asserting.</p><p>A nominalist could try to address the problem by suggesting nominalistic <em>paraphrases</em> for mathematical sentences. She might claim, for example, that when one asserts ‘the number of the dinosaurs is zero’ one is best understood as making the (nominalistically kosher) claim that there are no dinosaurs, and that when one asserts ‘1 + 1 = 2’ one is best understood as making the (nominalistically kosher) claim that any individual and any other individual will, taken together, make two individuals.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>More carefully: ∀x∀y(x≠ y → ∃!<sub>2</sub>z(z = x ∨ z = y)).</p></blockquote><p>[The symbolic notation can be read quasi-formally as “for all <em>x</em> and for all <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em> doesn’t equal <em>y</em>, then there exist exactly two <em>z</em>‘s such that <em>z</em> equals <em>x</em> or <em>z</em> equals <em>y.</em>“]</p><p>The paraphrasing solution is roughly what I’m committed to as a nominalist. Actually, “committed” is too strong. It’s simpler than it. It just seems obvious to me that some form of nominalism is true, and that some aspect of that will involve paraphrasing.</p><p>That is, it’s easiest for me to accept an origin of numbers that involves something like “put as many apples in my bag as I have children” becoming shortened to, say, “put two apples in my bag.” And from there “two apples” becomes “two whatever” and then “two” becomes reified into a concept in its own right that can be invoked or signified or referred to explicitly with symbols such as the numeral “2” and expressions like “a quarter of eight” and “1/4 times 8” and “the square root of four” and “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B4%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{4} " title="\sqrt{4} " srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">” and “4<sup>1/2</sup>” and “the lowest prime number” and “the only even prime number” and “the lowest even non-negative integer” and “4 minus 2” and “5 minus 3” and so on forever.</p><p>There are infinitely many ways to represent the quantity two.</p><p>It’s plausible to me that, from something more or less along those lines, we developed over many centuries the beautiful system(s) of pure and applied mathematics we continue to develop today. So we now have the square root of two and of other prime numbers, negative numbers, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{-1} " title="\sqrt{-1} " srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">, different sizes of infinity, as many dimensions as you want, arguments about Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, and wherein we are more or less able to satisfy a key desideratum of consistency within particular domains.</p><p>What do I mean by “particular domains”? Calculus students will lose points for not treating 0<sup>0</sup> as an indeterminate form (just like 0/0), even though mathematicians maintain that the answer is 1, “because mathematicians said so” (as it’s put in <a href="https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/12/q-what-does-00-zero-raised-to-the-zeroth-power-equal-why-do-mathematicians-and-high-school-teachers-disagree/">this <em>Ask a Mathematician/Ask a Physicist</em> post</a>; does this constitute a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formalism-mathematics/#ForPos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnapian formalist move</a>?). Depending on which calculator you input 0<sup>0</sup> into, you’ll get different answers. I put it into Google calculator and Desmos and got 1; Wolfram|Alpha yields “undefined” and lists it as an <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Indeterminate.html">indeterminate form</a>.</p><p>In that same calculus course, students must treat 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … onto infinity as getting bigger and bigger without converging to a specific value. Common sense and mathematicians agree with this. But a physicist might tell you the sum of those numbers—or, at least, the proper value to put on the right side of the equal sign—is −1/12.</p><p>To see physicist Tony Padilla excited about this result—while assuring us that, “I know this looks like a bit of mathematical hocus-pocus sort of thing, but actually in truth it’s not… we know it’s not… because these kind of sums appear in physics all the time”—see this 2014 video from the popular Numberphile YouTube channel:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-I6XTVZXww" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>The video garnered pushback, such as from another popular YouTube channel, Matheloger:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuIIjLr6vUA" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>And I recall seeing comments from math teachers saying things like “math is hard enough to teach without you telling our students wrong things.”</p><p>Padilla wrote a defense of his answer that I highly recommend anyone (fake-) outraged by the Numperphile video read, in which he compellingly, and I’d say passionately, maintains that −1/12 “is the <em>only</em> sensible value one can attach to this divergent sum. Infinity is not a sensible value. In my opinion, as a physicist, infinity has no place in physical observables, and therefore no place in Nature”: “<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzap4/response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do we get if we sum all the natural numbers?</a>”</p><p>Or for a sober, yet still aptly wide-eyed-at-the-weirdness-of-it-all, assessment of the situation, see Numperphile’s follow-up video called&nbsp; “Why −1/12 Is a Gold Nugget”:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Oazb7IWzbA" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>It features mathematician Edward Frenkel, who points out that the −1/12 result—which goes at least as far back as Leonhard Euler (born in 1707) and has a place in pure mathematics—arises in applications from an effort to make the sum meaningful or useful (very useful, in fact) for certain contexts. In other words, with sufficient mathematical rigor and self-awareness, the manipulations that enable us to jettison infinity while leaving behind a “golden nugget” of −1/12 are legitimate.</p><p>And yet, says Frenkel:</p><blockquote><p>I think, actually, we don’t really fully understand what’s happening here… it certainly is not the result of summation of these numbers; it is something else, but what is it? … it is the best kept secret maybe in physics, in quantum physics, that most of the calculations that physicists do today are like this. … I would say, it’s not exactly the sum… it blows up, it is infinite… does it mean that in some sense, there is a context in which this infinite sum is mysteriously −1/12? I’m not sure.</p></blockquote><p>Returning to the present point, it seems obvious to me that these developments and results and fascinating discussions can occur whether or not numbers exist independently of human activities. I’m unconvinced that the story requires the additional fact that there exists an eternal and immaterial mathematical realm against which our mathematical statements must hold up in order to be true; in order, for example, for −1/12 to be, in some sense, true. Same goes for 1 + 1 = 2.</p><p>I believe one and one really can make two <em>without</em> the existence of a realm of independently existing, immaterial, inert abstract objects we call “numbers.”</p><p>This is a naive intuition, I admit. And I’m not prepared to spend the next five to 20 years trying (and almost certainly failing) to bear it out to the satisfaction of everyone interested in this problem (myself included). So instead I’ll commit to a weaker claim. Namely, that my naive intuition has yet to be swayed by any platonist account I’ve seen. This includes Rayo’s, which I’m almost ready to get back to.</p><p>First, I think I need to say a little more about what sort of objects platonists take numbers to be. <span>A standard view, as I’ve already noted, is that they are abstract, causally inert objects that do not exist in the material world.</span></p><p>This raises many problems that I will only barely touch on here. A great place to start a deeper dive into those problems, along with the core problems nominalists face, is in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(<em>SEP</em>) entries “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/">Abstract Objects</a>” and “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/">Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics</a>.” In that order. (And I’m sure to link more sources as I go along here.)</p><p>I will say that, despite knowing that many brilliant mathematically inclined people believe in a platonic realm of mathematical objects, I have not been swayed. This includes when the above-mentioned Frenkel writes in <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y3HqfL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Love and Math</em></a> (2014), a book I adore, that he believes in a “Platonic world of mathematics” that “exists independently of physical …</p></div></article></div>

This is a collaboration between The Generalist and </em><a href="https://latecheckout.substack.com/"><em>Late Checkout</em></a><em>. </em></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6000d83070ff9e96671cf34d_Ellipse.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>“You ever stop to realize how fragile all this is?”&nbsp;<br></p><p>George Carlin wears a black long-sleeved t-shirt, hunched over a microphone. In the minimalism of his outfit and the starkness of his bald pate, he almost resembles a tech executive delivering a keynote. But he’s too rumpled for that, too delightfully sour, as if a satyr stumbled through Steve Jobs’ wardrobe.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“It wouldn’t take much to throw us right back into barbaric times. All you’d have to do would be eliminate electricity.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>Carlin continues, embarking on one of his trademark <em>quite-frightening-very-funny tirades</em>, the flashes of incandescent, articulate fury that made him a genius. No electricity means no lights, he explains. No batteries. No fuel. No water. No computers. It means jail doors springing open, crime flooding the streets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s a bleak, bitter joke and serves as a coherent expression of Carlin’s particular weltanschauung: life is a sleepwalk along a knife-edge. It also shades his view of electricity and what it represents. When harnessed, it’s a mollifying, enlightening force; the thin membrane between civilization and barbarism.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If Carlin is all rapid-fire verbosity in his 2005 set, he’s an expert of restraint in a complementary line:&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Electricity is just organized lightning.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are a hundred ways someone might describe a company like Reddit, but this is what we think of most. In its particular energy and vibrancy, its wild potential and ugly foibles, its kindness and cruelty, the social media platform occupies the liminal space of Carlin’s electricity. Just as it is close to some of our unseemliest instincts, so too is it a vehicle for creativity and connection. In short, Reddit is organized lightning. As the conductor of cultural currents, it may have more upside than any other social media company.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>In this piece, we’ll explore:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><ol role="list"><li>Reddit’s topsy-turvy history</li><li>Why it’s undervalued</li><li>Where the company is headed</li><li>The Galaxy Brain moves to take it to the next level<br></li></ol><h2>r/History</h2><p>Few companies have the narrative arc of Reddit. It’s a classic hero's tale with a call to adventure, challenges and setbacks, and a triumphant return.<br></p><h3><strong>The beginning</strong></h3><p>The same year that Carlin delivered his iconic set, University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian took a drive. They headed for Boston, where computer scientist, writer, and entrepreneur Paul Graham was scheduled to give a talk.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Huffman, a computer science student himself, was the motivating force, but he would have Ohanian to thank for brokering a meeting with Graham. As the story goes, at the end of the talk, Ohanian asked if Graham would come out to a drink with them. Over a few beers, Graham encouraged the pair to apply to his new incubator in Cambridge: Y Combinator.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Like so many others, Ohanian and Huffman didn’t get in with their first idea. The pair pitched “My Mobile Menu,” a way to order food via text. While Graham didn’t like that MMM, he invited them to come back to Boston for a brainstorm. By the end of an hour, they’d hit on a new mission: build the “front page of the internet.” Reddit was born.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It didn’t take long for the founding duo to ship v1. Written in Graham’s beloved Lisp, the site served as a fairly straightforward link aggregator that allowed for upvoting and downvoting. The first 100 accounts on the site were created by either Ohanian or Huffman to give the appearance of activity. A snapshot from the site from that period (thank you WayBackMachine) illustrates just how much of the culture was baked in early on, featuring conspiracy theories, wonkish dev chat, strong opinions, and “spez,” Huffman’s username.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60327dd2cf48e5169301c0da_4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>‍<br><strong>Growing pains and the acquisition</strong></h3><p>Soon enough, Reddit added a third member. Aaron Schwartz, a coding prodigy also in YC’s cohort, merged his project, Infogami, with the company and hopped aboard. As Schwartz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001237/https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget">later told it</a>, his reprogramming of the site from Lisp to Python coincided with a meaningful uptick in traffic:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>When I first started at Reddit, growth was slow. The site was put online very early — within weeks of starting work on it — but for the first three months it hardly got above three thousand visitors a day, which is about baseline for a useful RSS feed. Then, in a couple weeks of marathon coding sessions, we moved the site from Lisp to Python and I wrote an article about it for my blog. It got a lot of attention — Hell hath no fury like a Lisp fan scorned — and even today I still run into people at parties who, when I mention that I worked at Reddit, say "Oh, the site that switched from Lisp."<p>Around that time traffic really started taking off. In the next three months, our traffic doubled twice.</p></blockquote><p>Reddit was off to the races, though it wouldn’t follow the parabolic growth trajectory of other social media companies. Instead, the site grew rapidly but relatively steadily. Still, even after the company reached millions of visitors a month, generating revenue remained a challenge. Again, from Schwartz:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>We still had no idea how to make money. We sold t-shirts on the site, but every time we made a little bit of money on those we spent it on ordering more t-shirts. We signed up with a major Web ad representative to sell ads on our site, but they never seemed to be able to sell any ads for us and we rarely made more than, literally, a couple of dollars a month. Another idea we had was licensing the "Reddit technology" to let other people build sites that worked like Reddit. But we couldn't find anyone who wanted to license it from us.<br></blockquote><p>That context explains why Reddit was tempted to sell just a year after founding, giving up ownership to Condé Nast for a reported $10 - $20 million. (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/alexis-ohanian-reflects-on-selling-reddit-for-10-million.html">The deal closed on Halloween</a>). Over the following years, that initial trio drifted away from the company: Huffman to found Hipmunk, Ohanian to a Kiva Fellowship, and Schwartz to pursue web activism. (As you may know, Schwartz would go on to commit suicide in 2013.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Reddit continued to grow under corporate ownership, though it's hard not to feel a shadow hanging over that trajectory. What might have been had the company capitalized instead of selling? How might Huffman, Ohanian, and Schwartz have stewarded Reddit and developed the product with the right support?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The comeback</strong></h3><p>Perhaps recognizing it was not the best guardian of a social media business, Condé Nast spun Reddit out in 2011, with parent company Advance Networks serving as a passive shareholder. Yishan Wong joined as CEO the following year, leaving in 2014 after the company refused to move its HQ closer to his home in Daly City. He was replaced by Ellen Pao on an interim basis with Ohanian returning as executive chairman. When Pao was ousted in 2015, driven out of her role by a user base incensed over the firing of a popular Reddit employee, Huffman stepped back into the CEO seat. The band was back together.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s hard to overstate just how central Reddit was to pop-culture over the decade that saw Ohanian and Huffman found the business, sell it, and return once more. In both good and bad moments, the valorous and vile, Reddit was there. It served as the de facto town square for events like “The Fappening,” the Sony Pictures hack, the Boston Bombing, GamerGate, and Pizzagate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since retaking the reins, Huffman has shown a desire to grow Reddit’s product and stamp out the site’s most toxic elements. The mobile experience was improved. The site was redesigned. Video was introduced. And, thousands of hate-filled subreddits were expunged.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Concerns that a more hands-on approach to moderation would curb the anarchic good-times vibe of the platform have been emphatically repudiated this year, with Reddit the ground-zero for the epic GameStop short squeeze.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Despite being one of the internet’s most popular websites, sixteen years after it was founded, Reddit feels like it's just getting started.</p><h2>r/Value</h2><p>Reddit is one of the most misunderstood and undervalued companies in the world.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A little over a week ago, Huffman announced the company had raised $250 million in new capital at a valuation of $6 billion. The round was led by Dubai-based firm Vy Capital, with follow-ons from a16z, Sequoia, and Tencent.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To which we have to say: <em>$6 billion? That’s it?&nbsp;</em>‍</p><p>In a world in which Clubhouse is worth $1 billion after a year of (impressive) traction, and Dispo is pegged at $100 million for an app still in beta, Reddit — cultural petri-dish, bastion of expression, distributed hedge-fund, meme-maker, group-therapist — is only worth $6 billion?<br></p><h3><strong>A thought experiment</strong></h3><p>Humor us. You’re given the chance to look at two social media companies. Your job is to pick the one that you think has the highest valuation. Here are a couple details.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Company 1</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>MAUs: 353 million</li><li>MAU growth YoY: 7%<br></li></ul><p><strong>Company 2&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>MAUs: 430 million</li><li>MAU growth YoY: 30%&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Now, you’re right to be a bit grumpy with us. You don’t have much to go on, right? No revenue, no costs, no churn. How are you supposed to figure out which is most valuable without that information? But if any space is defined by user growth, above anything else, it’s social media.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So which do you choose?</p><p>Company 1 is Twitter, worth $58 billion. Company 2, with more MAUs and 4x the growth, is Reddit. From a growth an engagement perspective, Reddit compares favorably to many of social media's public behemoths with close to the same number of MAUs as Pinterest. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/603282383bcd2639d35b1abe_CleanShot%202021-02-21%20at%2010.53.45%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Yet, the implied value of a Reddit user is criminally low:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60327d9d1e2df115f85a3d21_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br>Public and private market investors effectively value a Facebook DAU at 3.5x the price of a Reddit one, and a Facebook MAU at 19x of the Reddit equivalent.<br></p><h3><strong>Explanations and misconceptions</strong></h3><p>What is the rationale behind this aggressive discounting? We think it stems from outdated historical data and an anachronous view of the product.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Sure, historically, Reddit has done a poor job of bringing in revenue on a per-user basis. In 2019, Reddit was said to have an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $0.30, much less than Facebook at …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we have a moment that many of our readers will be waiting for. The AMD Threadripper Pro is now available at retail with additional platform vendors entering the space. As such, we wanted to quickly mark the occasion, and also offer an update to our earlier ASUS coverage.<span id="more-51172"></span></p>
<h2>AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro Lenovo Exclusivity Ends</h2>
<p>The AMD Threadripper Pro platform was announced in the summer of 2020. We covered this in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-is-a-workstation-epyc-or-wepyc/">AMD Threadripper Pro is a Workstation EPYC or WEPYC</a> piece. At the time, the platform was exclusively sold by Lenovo and we know many of our readers purchased these systems at work.</p>
<p><iframe title="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX Review the &quot;WEPYC&quot;" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVLDlrz09Os?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Recently, we published our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/lenovo-thinkstation-p620-review-first-amd-threadripper-pro-workstation/">Lenovo ThinkStation P620 Review</a> using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-3995wx-review-a-bold-wepyc/">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX</a>. It is a great platform, however, it is very focused on selling to organizations that have an existing Lenovo relationship. For those who do not have existing Lenovo relationships and access to corporate discounts, the P620 pricing was on the higher end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In our earlier coverage, we noted how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-launch/">Supermicro</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/gigabyte-wrx80-su8-ipmi-amd-threadripper-pro-motherboard/">Gigabyte</a>, and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/asus-pro-ws-wrx80e-sage-se-wifi-amd-threadripper-pro/">ASUS</a> are releasing platforms to help proliferate Threadripper Pro. As part of the retail availability launch today, we have a few ASUS updates.</p>

<p>The first big update is that we have the ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI in the lab. Expect a review in the coming weeks of this platform. What we can say, with complete certainty is that ASUS is offering a highly differentiated solution compared to what Lenovo has been shipping.</p>
<figure id="attachment_51174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51174"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-hits-retail-asus-update/asus-pro-ws-wrx80e-sage-se-wifi-pcie-slots/" rel="attachment wp-att-51174"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-PCIe-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS Pro WS WRX80E SAGE SE WiFi PCIe Slots" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-PCIe-Slots.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-PCIe-Slots-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-PCIe-Slots-696x465.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-PCIe-Slots-629x420.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51174">ASUS Pro WS WRX80E SAGE SE WiFi PCIe Slots</figcaption></figure>
<p>An example of one of the features we did not cover in our motherboard launch piece, but we have found during testing is that the system comes with a Hyper M.2 x16 Gen4 card. This allows four M.2 SSDs to be added to the system via a PCIe x16 slot. Combined with three onboard M.2 slots, that means one can put seven M.2 SSDs on this platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_51173" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51173"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-hits-retail-asus-update/asus-pro-ws-wrx80e-sage-se-wifi-hyper-m-2-x16-gen4-card/" rel="attachment wp-att-51173"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-Hyper-M.2-x16-Gen4-card.jpg" alt="ASUS Pro WS WRX80E SAGE SE WiFi Hyper M.2 X16 Gen4 Card" width="800" height="482" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-Hyper-M.2-x16-Gen4-card.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-Hyper-M.2-x16-Gen4-card-400x241.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-Hyper-M.2-x16-Gen4-card-696x419.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ASUS-Pro-WS-WRX80E-SAGE-SE-WiFi-Hyper-M.2-x16-Gen4-card-697x420.jpg 697w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51173">ASUS Pro WS WRX80E SAGE SE WiFi Hyper M.2 X16 Gen4 Card</figcaption></figure>
<p>Expect the full review soon. Still, one of the challenges with reviewing a motherboard in this space is that many of the buyers are going to be corporations that have little interest in building their own workstations. Selling a motherboard meets the needs of some in the market, but others want to purchase complete systems. ASUS is partnering with Velocity Micro to offer a workstation based on the new chips and the ASUS motherboard. This is the Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150:</p>
<figure id="attachment_51175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51175"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-hits-retail-asus-update/velocity-micro-promagix-hd150-wrx80-tr-pro-system/" rel="attachment wp-att-51175"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System.jpg" alt="Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 WRX80 TR Pro System" width="800" height="544" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-400x272.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-696x473.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-618x420.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51175">Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 WRX80 TR Pro System</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 uses a closed-loop liquid cooling solution instead of Lenovo’s air cooler. This can be important when one uses higher TDP CPUs such as the Threadripper Pro 3995WX.</p>
<p>This is an important development for our readers who need to purchase complete systems instead of motherboards at work. ASUS has a great motherboard, but selling it as a complete system makes it more accessible in this market. One of the other nice features is that the ProMagix HD150 starts at under $4,500 which is a lot lower than Lenovo has been selling the P620 for while it had little to no competition.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Overall, we know this is a day many of our readers have been waiting for since the original announcement in July 2020. It is now possible to purchase non-Lenovo AMD Threadripper Pro CPUs, motherboards, and systems opening up the use cases for these systems.</p>

We have drones too.</figcaption></figure><p id="f23b">Columbus has been home to a large group of insurance businesses for decades. Just take a look across the Downtown Columbus skyline. There are at least five established insurance companies (annual revenues well over $500M each) who have their headquarters within a few miles of each other, including Nationwide, where I’m an investor as part of the venture capital team.</p><p id="7702">Columbus’ central business district is dotted with insurance companies. They’ve made a huge impact — not only on the city and its physical footprint but also the broader insurance industry. Though there is a focus on the auto sector with Ohio’s legacy in the automobile industry, today these are big and robust businesses ranging across property &amp; casualty as well as life and other lines of business.</p><p id="7e67">However, there is now an exciting new cohort of insurance businesses being built in Columbus. Called “insurtechs,” these companies operate in a wide variance of coverage types and sectors. But the one thing that ties them together is a digital-first or technology-infused approach to the insurance industry, which is a trend playing out both in Columbus and globally. In my role on Nationwide’s venture capital team, I’m fortunate to have a front-row seat to the action — both here and abroad.</p><p id="c663">There are multiple meaningfully venture-backed businesses in Columbus that are growing fast with disruptive business models, including Root (just filed their S-1!), Beam Dental, Matic (of which Nationwide is an investor), and Branch.</p><p id="b7db">These industry hubs may appear to happen by accident, but when we look deeper, there is often a common ingredient — talent. Industry clusters offer job opportunities and job mobility, making the sell for Columbus a little bit easier — especially when recruiting specialized out-of-town talent. The density of colleges and universities, especially a major one like Ohio State University, makes it easier to find early career talent when growing a team. It’s also unique that Columbus has technology investors like Nationwide and Drive Capital that are focusing on finding Insurtech startups as an investment theme. (<em>Note: Drive invested in both Root and Beam.)</em></p><p id="8b89">Nationwide competes with some of the companies above and partners with others. In any case, the density of talent from both entry-level who grow into roles and the executive talent brought in from other places has a net positive impact for Columbus. Regardless of COVID-19’s impact to remote or in-person working, I’m optimistic the Columbus Insurtech buzz is here to stay.</p><p id="c0f2">The momentum is clear. Columbus is not only one of the most active cities in the United States for insurance in general, but it’s also an emerging Insurtech hub. I’m excited to contribute with capacity on the venture capital side (take our dedicated <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/cps/nw-ventures.html" rel="noopener">$100 million venture capital fund at Nationwide</a> for example), but the real energy is with some of the most compelling businesses in the entire insurance technology sector being located right here in Columbus. While some of these companies are just getting started, it’s clear to see that the competitive advantage of being located so close to legacy insurance carriers is bringing the capabilities needed to build the next generation of great insurance businesses right here in Ohio’s capital.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Build with us!</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Companies Prepare for Waves of Data Breach Lawsuits]]>

<p>Data breaches are inevitable. And no amount of security protocols can provide absolute assurance that consumer information is protected. With increasing threats of identity theft, who should be responsible for the majority of data breach risk, the consumer or the business? California lawmakers argue that the majority of that burden on the business owner.</p>



<p>They incentivized stricter security measures by broadening the requirements needed to file a lawsuit in the case of a data breach. By lowering this bar, they have essentially shifted more liability to businesses. Prop 24’s amendments go into effect January 1st 2023, but has a look back period starting on January 1st 2022. Whether businesses should or should not bear the majority of risk, they will need to examine the parameters of these changes closely and update their data security to the most recent standards in order to prevent these lawsuits.</p>







<h2>Prop 24’s Changes in the CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)</h2>



<p>The CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) is an addendum to the historic <a href="https://toslawyer.com/what-are-the-requirements-for-ccpa-compliance/">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> . It is a series of amendments that:</p>



<ol><li>Allow consumers to limit access to sensitive data</li><li>Stop businesses from keeping data beyond its use</li><li>Triple the fine for violating children’s privacy rights</li><li>Create a new agency with enforcement power</li></ol>



<p>And Lastly,</p>



<p><strong>Expand the definition of sensitive data to include email and password information in the list of items covered during a negligent data breach.</strong></p>



<p>Since it is difficult for consumers to track identity theft to a specific data breach, this particular amendment expands the CCPA right of action to consumers that can’t prove a financial loss. </p>



<p>This particular change has two profound implications. First, it makes it much harder to agree on damages if there is no financial loss. As a result, violations range between $100-$750 per record. Secondly, this incentivizes bad actors to exploit the system for profit. </p>



<p>Since many companies will not be able to keep up with increasing standards for security measures, they will need to update their SAAS agreement <a href="http://toslawyer.com/negotiating-a-saas-agreement-what-you-should-know/">indemnification clauses</a> to account for this type of dispute.</p>



<h2><strong>Consumer Actions under the CCPA and the CPRA</strong></h2>



<p>Consumer actions hinge on a company’s failure to protect their personal information from a breach. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_24,_Consumer_Personal_Information_Law_and_Agency_Initiative_(2020)">CPRA (Prop 24) broadens what is considered personal information</a>.</p>



<p>The most critical amendments to the CCPA are just two or three letters. The CCPA previously required that information be either nonencrypted or nonredacted to qualify under the Act. Lawmakers used the word “or ” instead of “and ” when adding email and password to the list. This has significant implications on what qualifies the data and how companies failed to protect the breach.</p>



<p>If one were to read the qualification before the amendment, the only data that would qualify would be anything that could reveal someone’s identity or any personal data lacking encryption. Now email and password information neither need to be encrypted nor reveal someone’s identity to qualify. This amendment means that anonymous throwaway emails are included. This critical two-letter word significantly broadens the scope of liability in data breach lawsuits.</p>



<p>The second change to the law slightly limits the scope of liability by changing the “or” between “nonencrypted OR nonredacted” to “nonencrypted AND nonredacted.” This change means any data other than email and password needs to lack encryption and reveal personal data’s identity to qualify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the data in a breach meets the two combined conditions or any personal information includes someone’s email and password, a breach would need to be the result of a company not implementing and maintaining reasonable security procedures and practices. While previous administrations have interpreted “reasonable” in one matter, there’s no guarantee that will hold in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>What Constitutes Reasonable Security Procedures and Practices against data breaches?</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="data breach" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<p>The AG established the baseline by using <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/">20 data security controls published by the Center for Internet Security</a>. Any agreement with a SaaS company should warrant compliance with these control as a minimum standard.</p>



<p>While these guidelines may not protect you, or your vendors, in the future, failing to meet&nbsp;the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/dbr/2016-data-breach-report.pdf">reasonable standards enumerated by the state’s AG in 2014 and 2016</a> would likely hurt any defense you might make in case of a violation.</p>



<h2><strong>Managing Privacy Standards In SAAS Agreements</strong></h2>



<p>Security is often a point of negotiation when striking a SAAS agreement with third party vendors. Businesses don’t want to accept the risk if a vendor’s security isn’t up to par. Yet, most SaaS agreements don’t go far enough to protect the business. For example, companies can neglect to include who is responsible for notifying customers of a breach. Identifying each party’s data security obligations is critical to establish who will be accountable in the case of a lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When there is a breach of consumer data, the effects can last for years. According to UISM and the Ponemon Institute’s research, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">the average cost of a data breach in 2020 is $3.86 million</a>. This cost includes the time and direct costs from dealing with a breach, regulatory fines, potential lost opportunity costs from customer churn and negative publicity, and a data breach lawsuit.</p>



<h2><strong>Expect More Legal Challenges and Data Breach Lawsuits</strong></h2>



<p>Regardless of the steps that businesses take to protect themselves from security breaches, lawsuits, and regulatory fines, Prop 24 vastly increases the likelihood that additional data breach lawsuits will occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 50 lawsuits had already been filed by July – just six months into the CCPA – covering data breaches, noncompliance with the CCPA, and violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL). Because of the potential monetary awards, most of these actions come in the form of class-action lawsuits.</p>



<p>The increase in class action suits came due to the CCPA’s requirement that offers statutory damages rather than providing actual damages. CPRA, or Prop 24, could increase the number of class action lawsuits.</p>



<h2><strong>Increasing security isn’t enough</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x.jpg" alt="strategy" width="920" height="616" srcset="https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x.jpg 920w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x-300x201.jpg 300w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"></figure></div>



<p>Since encryption may not be enough to protect this information from a breach, companies need to update indemnification clauses for these types of scenarios. The new amendments provide a wide range from <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ccpa-qotd-what-are-the-penalties-for-91822/">$100 to $7,500 per record</a> in applicable damages. Establishing an agreed-upon damage amount in the indemnification clause will help protect against costly class-action suits. A full understanding of the rapidly evolving security standards and legal precedence is critical to making these updates to your SAAS agreements.&nbsp;</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json"</span><span>).</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This is actually large enough to be a little challenging. So i <a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/tree/master/src/hackernews">downloaded them all</a> using 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> and <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">aiohttp</a> with a rate of about 100 messages per second and exported them into <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html">elasticsearch</a>. The whole process took about 3 days.</p>

<p>They started in late 2006 and most of the stuff that we have become completely used to was not even existing then.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">protocol</h3>



<p><strong>96.6%</strong> of all posted urls are HTTP<strong>S</strong> nowadays. And currently about 30,000 URLs are posted each month as can be seen in the next figure.</p>

<p>It’s just interesting how <em>smooth</em> the above graph is. HTTPS was specified in 2000, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s encrypt</a> started in 2016, 
Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html">deprecated</a> HTTP in 2018 and a lot more milestones will have happened in between but the figure shows none of it. Only a continuous steady climb.</p>



<p>One can still find a thousand HTTP links per month ;-)</p>

<p>Here is a top ten of Jan/Feb 2021:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> 37x diego-pacheco.blogspot.com
 30x m.nautil.us
 17x bit.ly
 12x www.bbc.com
 11x nautil.us
 11x web.archive.org
 11x www.paulgraham.com
 10x eepurl.com
 10x www.tr0lly.com
  9x blogs.quovantis.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are actually people posting stuff like <code>http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210103-englands-sleepy-scientology-town</code>. Is this by purpose or have they disabled the automatic redirect to https and don’t know it? At least in the case of the bbc page, there actually is no redirect when visiting the link (March 2021).. Maybe if one posts a lot of links like this and then hangs around at public wifi spots, hoping someone clicks the links and visits a logged-in payed site via HTTP..</p>

<p>What are actually the first HTTPS pages posted on hackernews?</p>

<p>Here’s another historic indicator, and not quite as smooth as the HTTP/S graph above. The percentage of URLs starting with <code>www.</code> or ending with <code>.io</code> or <code>.org</code>.
(You can click or double-click on the variables on the right to show/hide them individually.)</p>



<h3 id="query-parameters">query parameters</h3>

<p>Hackernews is a marketing target (Well, just my guess, if you disagree please 
<a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/issues/new">create an issue</a> so we can try to proof/disproof numerically) and the following figure shows the percentage of URLs containing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters">UTM tracking parameters</a>. It basically means someone is using google analytics to count the number of visitors that come on her page by following a specific link, like a post on hackernews.</p>

<p>The popular query parameters <code>p</code> and <code>id</code> are included for comparison. They are generally not used for campaign tracking. (Again, you can click the variables on the right to view/hide them to get a better overview.)</p>



<p>Regarding the marketing allegation above, i must admit that it’s <em>only</em> 12 tracking code URLs per day on average. But why is it limited in time like this?</p>

<p>We can split by the query <strong>values</strong> of the UTM parameters. Below are roughly all major UTM trackers. Note that, e.g. <code>hackernews</code> most of the time means: Someone not affiliated with hackernews posted a link there, putting something like <code>?utm_source=hackernews</code> in the URL to count how many people click the posted link.</p>

<p>(What this also implies is that google attaches hackernews to their profile of you, but hey, it’s free!)</p>



<p>So increasingly different actors are posting their tracking stuff but in March 2018 they all stop? Is it that hackernews does remove them automatically in most cases?</p>

<p>Let’s compare this with the URLs posted in comments. The percentage of utm tracking links versus utm-free links in the post’s text are plotted below. It’s not much really, a 10th of the url-field numbers. And it’s completely undisturbed by the March 2018 cut-off.</p>



<p>(These numbers are not as accurate as the url-field numbers above. The utm-urls are filtered with this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html">lucene-style query</a> <code>text: href AND utm AND (source OR campaign)</code> on a text field tokenized by the default <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-analyzer.html">stop analyzer</a>. So there might be a few false positives in there.)</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26316715">A stupid post</a>, but genuinely out of a hacker’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">curiosity</a>, confirms the suspicion that Hackernews is actually removing those parameters now.</p>

<p>And how come these</p>



<p>utm-tagged URLs since April 2018? Are they privileged people? Or have they just another parameter in front as tested <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26319485">in this post</a>?</p>

<p>Next would be the part about hostnames and their usage over time but it’s actually a bit boring.</p>

<p>Things like, <em>medium.com started in 2012 and is now the most popular link target</em> do not catch my attention too much. In case of objection, grab the <a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/blob/master/src/hackernews/download.py">download script</a> and explore yourselves.</p>

On September 2019 <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/2019/09/candidate-sites-for-spacex-starship.html" target="_blank" title="Candidate sites for SpaceX Starship Mars landings revealed"><b>it was revealed</b></a> SpaceX has selected several <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/p/starship.html" target="_blank" title="Summary about the SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy in development"><b>Starship</b></a> candidate landing sites on Mars. The candidate sites were located in Southern Arcadia Planitia East of Erebus Montes and one in Phlegra Montes.</p><p>

Since then <b>SpaceX has conducted several workshops with the Mars science community to evaluate and narrow the list of candidate landing sites</b>. All the sites must fit several criteria:
  
</p><ol>
  <li>close to significant <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/2019/04/map-of-shallow-subsurface-water.html" target="_blank" title="Map of shallow subsurface water distribution on Mars">deposits of water/ice</a>, a required resource for in situ propellant production and a consumable to support habitation;</li>
  <li>elevation below -2 km (with respect to the MOLA geoid) that can support the delivery of large payloads, with -3 km preferred;</li>
  <li>latitude must be &lt;40° for solar power and thermal management, and closer to the equator is desirable;</li>
  <li>multiple separate landing locations spaced within a few km of each other, to support the multiple missions needed to grow an outpost;</li>
  <li>slopes should be &lt;5° over a 10 m length scale and the chance of impacting a rock greater than 0.5 m high (1 m diameter) should be &lt;5%;</li>
  <li>landing site must be radar reflective to enable measurement of the distance to the surface, and it must be load bearing to support the spacecraft at touchdown.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Recently an abstract with the <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/2420.pdf" target="_blank" title="'SpaceX Starship landing sites on Mars' by M.Golombek et al"><b>conclusions</b></a> has been published (the results of the study will be presented in two weeks, at the <i>52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference</i>), pointing out <b><span>4 prime</span> and <span>3 secondary</span> potential Starship landing sites selected for further study and located in Phlegra Montes, Erebus Montes and Southern Arcadia Planitia</b>:</p><div>
  
<ul>
  <li><span>PM-1</span> has the lowest latitude and elevation of the Phlegra Montes sites, a clear association with LDAs (local ice deposits expressed as lobate debris aprons), well developed polygons (one of the indicators of ice-related morphologies), and has the highest SWIM (Subsurface Water Ice Mapping) score for geomorphic indicators of ice;</li>
  <li><span>AP-1</span> (Arcadia Planitia) appears to be one of the safest sites and has a moderate combined SWIM score for ice;</li>
  <li><span>AP-9</span> has the thickest ice from radar returns (of the Arcadia Planitia sites) and geomorphology indicating shallow ice. It has the highest combined SWIM score for ice, but appears slightly rocky and rough;</li>
  <li><span>EM-16</span> has a clear association with an LDA with nearby brain terrain and the strongest radar return for shallow ice and the highest combined SWIM score of the Erebus Montes sites;</li>
  <li><span>AP-8</span> (Arcadia Planitia) appears to be one of the safest sites and has the highest neutron and combined SWIM scores for ice;</li>
  <li><span>EM-15</span> (Erebus Montes) is associated with a prominent but less extensive LDA, has well developed polygons, nearby brain terrain and appears smooth;</li>
  <li><span>PM-7</span> is adjacent to lineated valley fill (attributed to glacial flow) and appears to be the safest of the Phlegra sites.</li>

                                <div><p>(Bloomberg) -- Chinaâ€™s top financial regulator said all fintech platforms that offer banking services must comply with the same capital requirements as those imposed on traditional lenders to curb risks.</p><p>The regulator has set different deadlines for different financial services with the longest grace period of no more than two years, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and party secretary of the central bank, said at a briefing on Tuesday, without elaborating.</p><p>China has introduced a slew of rules for online lenders since late last year, telegraphing an abrupt loss of appetite among regulators for free-wheeling fintech innovations. The derailment of Ant Group Co.â€™s $35 billion share sale and mounting scrutiny of its operations have since upended one of Chinaâ€™s biggest business success stories. The authorities have also cracked down on technology juggernauts in everything from e-commerce to credit-scoring and payments.</p><p>The capital requirements are expected to hit Ant the most by crippling growth at its two microlending arms. Antâ€™s Jiebei and Huabei units had facilitated 1.7 trillion yuan ($263 billion) in consumer loans to 500 million people as of June 30, with only about 2% being kept on the parentâ€™s balance sheet. Concerns that it will need to raise capital to plug the shortfall and seek national licenses have prompted analysts at Morningstar Inc. to slash estimates on Antâ€™s valuation by half from $280 billion before its scrapped listing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Guo said China continues to support fintech innovation such as providing credit to small businesses, though they must do so according to law and regulations.</p><p>Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Was there a moment where things “clicked” that solidified your decision to stay on the IC track? If so, how do you reflect on this moment looking back?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>For a long time I wasn’t fully conscious about the decision. I was driven by passion and interest. But eventually, trying other career tracks like management, software engineering, etc. helped me realize I was happier as a designer, over time, than when in other roles.</p><p>It also helped meeting and talking with other people who had successfully stayed on an IC track or managed to find a way to keep building and creating, like Nicholas Felton, Guido Van Rossum, Jony Ive, Lee Byron, Koen Bok and many others. This really helped me feel comfortable and come to terms with my own draw toward making rather than coordinating.</p><p>Really, I think coordination vs creation is what it comes down to for me. They are two very different categories of concerns and you really have to feel connected to it in order to be willing to learn, evolve and enjoy your work.</p><p>As a designer my concerns are with planning, puzzling and learning. When I tried working in a software-engineering capacity, the concerns were similar, but with other materials and a very different way of learning.</p><p>With management it’s almost like a completely different universe where little to none of the skills of a designer are useful. It’s more about politics and juggling particular needs of individuals on your team. I admire people who are good at this and I really think it’s one of the hardest things you can do in life.</p><p>To me, choosing to be a designer means my concerns are focused around the following four categories:</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> What is the opportunity or issue that needs to change? What’s the history?</p><p><strong>Constraints:</strong> What do we know already? Where do we start exploring and unearthing more? This is a big part of design in my opinion: exploring constraints, learning and growing, then navigating constraints. Also, what materials do we work with and what are our options and trade-offs?</p><p><strong>People:</strong> Who are we doing this for, and what do they care about?</p><p><strong>Craft:</strong> less about a project, and more about a designer’s own ability to be effective, efficient and able to communicate their ideas.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What advice would you give to a senior designer who is trying to decide between the IC track and management track?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>Recognize that you’d be “going back to school” to learn a whole new skill-set. It’s a bit like a restaurant chef who starts a juice company — they are still in the food industry but their day-to-day is very different. What, and who, they spend time with has almost no overlap and the skills needed to be a great chef are likely quite different than what you need to successfully start and run a juice company.</p><p>Let me offer you something else by asking you a question:</p><p><strong>What type of person do you want to spend most of your time with?</strong></p><p>As a manager it will be coworkers, as a designer it will be the customers of whatever you are designing. Both are important aspects of the path to mastery, but it can be useful sometimes to try looking at something from a different perspective.</p><p>For me, the thought of spending hours a week, every week, for years speaking with customers of, for example, Figma or early Spotify, is exciting! It’s something that makes my brain tingle! You really have to introspect and listen to yourself to find your own answer to this question though.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What trade-offs or risks, if any, should designers know about before continuing down the IC path?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>It will likely always be a challenge to feel like you are learning and “progressing.” This will be totally fine as long as you’re willing to work on building mental tools and constructs to help yourself.</p><p>Tribes, friend circles, neighborhoods, countries, or professional organizations will have varying degrees of meaning attached to roles, titles and money. For example, in the USA a management title is important to many people because of history and culture; being the Foreman at a factory meant you were exceptionally skilled. This obviously doesn’t hold true in all cases, but understanding what political and social meaning your choice has will be important. Really, recognizing what group of people would make you feel most happy, most fulfilled.</p><p>As a career IC you will have to be <em>really</em> good at what you are doing in order to increase monetary compensation. If you are reading this, chances are you are already interested in, or already on, the path to mastery as a career IC designer. And that likely means you want to be the best you can be at your job. That’s great. Don’t worry about it too much though.</p><p>Speaking of compensation, depending on the company and region on Earth, management might or might not be considered a harder task and already command a higher level of monetary compensation than a designer. This varies quite a bit in my experience. Some companies, especially traditional or old ones, tend to give managers a higher salary than ICs simply by tradition and belief.</p><p>In some cultures, like in Japanese industry, there are even compensation models assuming that management is part of<!-- --> <em>anyone’s</em> career path (e.g. compensation as the sum area of a square where x is experience and y the number of people you manage).</p><p>If you are going to work or live in a place that is like this, it might be much harder to pursue an IC career.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>For designers committed to staying on the IC track beyond the senior level, what are the most important skills they should learn outside of the hard craft skills?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>The more experience you have, the more implicit authority you will have. It can be tough to understand that when you propose a silly idea over lunch when you have 5 years of experience has a very different impact than when you have 15 years of experience — someone might actually listen to you and go make it!</p><p>Really, this is a great thing, a sort of influential power you gain. It needs love, care and maintenance though — always work on getting better, learning from your mistakes and improving on your experience. There’s nothing more dangerous for an organization than a person with terrible ideas whom everyone admires professionally.</p><p>Powers you will have as an experienced IC:</p><p><strong>Experience with many things.</strong> What you are tackling today you might have experience with from the past. Use and share this experience in an informative way, not in a directing way! The past is different from the now, and the circumstances, people, and technology are definitely not the same. Avoid using your past experience as definitive facts or imposition as constraints.</p><p><strong>Sense of quality:</strong> You will likely have a better intuition for quality than professionally-younger designers.</p><p><strong>Intuition around cost.</strong> Design is not art, even though it can accidentally be seen as art later on. All design challenges have some form of budget: time, money, etc. With your experience, you’ve used your amazing human brain to form connections that gives you intuition...a form of premonition. You can sense that “this option will probably be much more costly than that option.”</p><p>This is great stuff and in some way what makes a good designer efficient: the ability to estimate and approximate the path to good decisions and solutions. Work on making use of this intuition, dare to “trust your gut.” Work on communicating these hunches to your coworkers in a way that is never condescending or dismissive but rather assistive.</p><p>For example, if you feel that the information density is too high, that there is too much information being displayed, you might start a conversation about how important approachability is to the thing you are building. In contrast, what you probably shouldn’t do, is to assert implicit authority — perhaps unconsciously — by saying “this won’t work, it’s way too dense.”</p><p>By leveling up to the subject or category of your intuition’s concern, you can help your coworkers see what you see: that the design may be a bit overwhelming. When people come to a concrete conclusion like that on their own, they are much better equipped to do a good job at addressing it. Sometimes it also turns out that your intuition is misdirected and a short conversation can help you realize that.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What are the mile markers for you to know that you are still growing as a designer and progressing in your career?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>I try to make things in ways which are new to me. When I do this, I have to spend time studying to learn, and that is really the focus of most of my hobby projects. When I come back to the thing I was making, and apply what I learned, I can feel that I made some progress. Sometimes this bears no fruit; sometimes it is not interesting or I fail to learn and that’s okay.</p><p>Another one: when professional people I look up to show their interest and support in my ideas. For example, I’ve dabbled in typography since the early 2000s but never been great at it until a few years ago when I decided to really focus on learning and getting good at making typefaces.</p><p>It took a year or so of pretty hard work before some designers in the typography industry reached out, recognized my progress, and in every single case helped me get even better and helped me see my own work in different ways. To me this really <em>feels</em> like improving and is important to me.</p><p>Finally, respect from leaders of organizations. When someone at a company with direct personal influence over its success or failure asks me for advice, I know that I’ve been able to build trust and do a good job as a designer. You, reader, probably agree with me that design as a tool and method is something fit for many problems, not just graphic problems or user interfaces. As a career IC designer, a goal of mine is to offer design (“design thinking” if you will) as a tool fit for many problems. When this is recognized and actually applied successfully, you’ve accomplished something that might only be possible as an advanced IC designer.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>How important are titles for individual contributors when it comes to impact or decision making? Is there a meaningful difference …</p></div></div></div>

<strong>Team:</strong> <code>cat /dev/random | grep "to be or not to be"</code><br>
<strong>Who:</strong> Jan-Willem Buurlage, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp, Timon Knigge,  Abe Wits<br>
<strong>Score:</strong> 10282641<br>
<strong>Rank:</strong> 16</p>

<p>Since we did quite well, here is a write-up of our participation in Hashcode 2021.</p>

<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>

<p>All four of us had previously participated in Hashcode, but this was the first
time in the current composition.  Since we estimated our chances of getting
through to the finals to be more than nothing, we decided to practice some
previous Hashcode problems.  Not all test sessions were equally successful, but
we did manage to get a good division of work: while I start by immediately writing
the IO <code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code> classes, and the <code>Output::score()</code> function,
the others always start with reading the statement, analysing the testcases,
and writing at least one greedy solution. This already is a big step up
from previous years/teams, where usually everybody would write the IO
themselves.</p>

<p>Next to this, we also set up a template repository (to be open-sourced
eventually) containing stub <code>io.h</code> and
<code>main.cpp</code> files. This way, all we have to do is store, read, and write the
<code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code>, while the API is already fixed so that others can start
writing their parts without waiting for me to be done with the basics.</p>

<p>Another great help is a custom <code>run.py</code> script that compiles a solution and runs it on all
testcases, stores <em>all</em> solution files, and keeps track of maximum scores per
testcase so far. To ease online submission,  it symlinks these best scores to a
separate directory, where it also writes the zipped code.
After post contest optimizations, the output looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ run.py ragnar/greedy.cpp
                                            best    this run    old best       delta
Score for  a                        :       2002        2002        2002           0
Score for  b                        :    4568339     4564400     4568339       -3939
Score for  c                        :    1312204     1289135     1312204      -23069
Score for  d                        :    2493047     2335840     2493047     -157207
Score for  e                        :     718417      673445      718417      -44972
Score for  f                        :    1419782      415082     1419782    -1004700
========================================
Total score:                            10513791     9279904    10513791
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also have a small Python script to help with analysing the testcases,
containing some functions to quickly print a summary of a list of numbers so
it’s easy to quickly get a feeling for e.g. the range of in-degrees in this
problem.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>With an early break from work, a quick outside walk, plenty of coffee, food,
and snacks stashed, the git template copied, and some final jumping jacks done,
we were ready for the start!</p>

<p>This sections covers all the mistakes we made - the interesting stuff comes
after.</p>

<h3 id="first-hour">First hour</h3>
<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [00:01] Timon Knigge: problem commit
&gt; [00:02] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: add input
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Help! The site didn’t load for most of us, so committing the pdf and input (as
we do anyway) turned out to be the faster option.
(Note: Times are relative to the contest start.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [00:11] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: input
&gt; [00:24] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: output
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>While the others started reading the long
<a href="https://hashcodejudge.withgoogle.com/#/rounds/5879728443490304/">statement</a>, I
wrote the reading of the input and writing of the output. (I won’t explain the
problem here, you probably already read it anyway.) Input was relatively
simple, but required a rewrite to directly map street names back to integers.
That probably took most of those 11 minutes:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Input data</summary>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>// Note: code samples have been slightly cleaned by removing unrelated code and</span>
<span>// debug output, but is otherwise exactly as written during the contest.</span>

<p>Output took slightly longer, mostly because this requires both writing and reading, so we can improve existing solutions using local search.
One nice thing here is that the problem statement has a sample input and output,
so now we can do a sanity check and read and write the output, and check whether it remains the same.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next up was adding the scoring function, which took considerable time.
This problem had relatively complicated simulation with lots of bookkeeping and
different ids, which made it slow to implement this correctly. I opted for a
simple yet slow approach as initial implementation:
For each time step, iterate over all streets and check
whether the traffic light is green using <code>std::map::lower_bound</code>. Each street
would have a queue of cars waiting there. This can be
improved in multiple ways, but I figured having an implementation fast was more
important than having a fast implementation.</p>

<p>In the end I got the right score on the sample output, and without submissions
to test the scoring function, I was happy and continued to write a simple
solution myself.</p>

<h3 id="everybody-gets-1">Everybody gets 1</h3>
<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:37] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: random solution
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The simplest idea I could come up with was the following:
for each intersection, give 1 second of green light to each incoming street.
We do not yet care about the order, so just order them as they
appear in the input.</p>

<p>Given all the work done before, coding this was very simple:</p>

<p>I ran this on all the testcases and made our first submission to the judge
system for a total of 7,885,741 points. A decent score with a position somewhere
in the top 1000 IIRC, but nowhere close to top 100. We had spent a lot of time
on IO and scoring already so this is not too surprising for a very simple first
attempt.</p>

<p>This is the point where we learned the judge actually has some great
visualizations and info to help debugging. If only we’d known before!</p>

<p>Playing around a bit, I was able to increase the score on F by 300k by making a
light green for \(x\) seconds when a total of \(x\) cars entered via that street.
The intuition as for why this may be a good idea should be obvious.</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<p>Fiddling a bit more, I was able to bump F another 500k as well by making it green for \(\sqrt x\) seconds.
At the time, this seemed sensible, \(\sqrt x\) being the geometric mean of \(1\) and
\(x\), but I didn’t really have a proper explanation.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, the introduction of the <code>if(usage[sid] == 0) continue</code>,
i.e. only giving green lights to streets that are used at all, in combination
with the original 1 second duration, bumped the score
for D another 600k.</p>

<p>At this point, we were in the 9.4M-9.6M range. Very respectable, but not yet in
the top.</p>

&gt; [01:59] Jan-Willem Buurlage: Update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Jan-Willem was working on a greedy solution, and Abe and Timon were
trying to analyse the testcases, but having a somewhat hard time because the
it seemed like the testcases did not contain much structure that could lead to simple greedy algorithms.</p>

<p>Jan-Willem was trying the following simple greedy idea:
for each traffic light,
change the green light when the queue for a not yet used light becomes longer
than the queue for the current light. Like the scoring function, this required a
lot of debugging to get working.</p>

<p>After some time, it turned out two of the issue were actually in my scoring
function. The first I had already fixed: the green light function broke on
intersections without a schedule assigned.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:58] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: fix write
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Secondly, the outputs made by his greedy solution weren’t accepted by the judge system.
It turns out my hope that the online judge would ignore intersections with 0 assigned green
lights, but alas, that’s not the case. This required a small rewrite of the
<code>Output::write()</code> function, first counting the number of intersections with any
assignment at all, and only then looping over them to print the schedules.</p>

<p>The score log gets a bit messy here, but it seems that this solution managed
to bump A to the 2002 optimum, and it gained another 6k points on E.</p>

I keep meeting people who need a break after just their first year or two. I’ve also experienced burnout myself (twice even). The first time, I had to take a six-month break. The second time, which was very recent, I needed a full year off before I could come back to programming.</p><p id="41b7">This year, I’ve spent a lot of time with people outside tech and noticed one thing: We don’t complain much about our work. We complain about bad bosses and bad projects, but not about coding itself. We take passion for granted. Surprised? Go through job offers. Passion is often one of the must-haves listed on them. We are expected to love our job, and even more, we are expected to make programming the center of our universes.</p><p id="31ae">But what about the people who do not love programming and still do their job all the same? Try to identify yourself as one of those among your colleagues or on Twitter, and you will immediately be dismissed as being a bad developer. However, is that really the case? People who do their job and try something different after working hours can be amazing programmers too. Not everyone needs to come home and work on side projects, create blog posts and YouTube videos about coding, and read programming books for fun.</p><p id="4a37">I have been one of those people trying to work through all my spare time. For many years, I felt guilty if I didn’t spend all my waking time chasing some imaginary productivity goal — and guess where that landed me?</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman burying her head into her arms" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nicotitto?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">nrd</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="61c0">Another aspect that is heavily biased against negative feedback is following new trends originating from FAANG companies.

Most of the time I start in bash, thinking the task won't be too complicated... but then before I know it I'm having to reread the bash man pages to figure out how arrays work for the thousandth time.</p><p>So really, I'd rather write scripts in a language that offers some more safety and better data structures. We're trying to learn Haskell at work, so maybe that?</p><p>Let's see a hello world:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env runghc

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>=</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>That seems pretty reasonable, and only takes like 300ms to compile and run. Not awful, but it's not as fast as a bash script, and it means I have to use Haskell's standard prelude instead of something safer like <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/projects/relude">relude</a> or <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude">nri-prelude</a>.</p><p>It's reasonable to solve this, though: I can just use <code>nix-shell</code> to get a <code>ghc</code> with packages.</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell

</span></code></pre><p>Well, that works, but I've traded speed for flexibility: run time has grown to over 2 seconds! Eep!</p><p>I don't think I should have to make this trade, so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script"><code>nix-script</code></a>. It transparently manages a compilation cache for these kinds of scripts, and lets you specify dependencies and build commands inside your source file!</p><p>That means the <code>nix-shell</code> example above can be rewritten like so:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script

The second time, and going forward until you change the script, it detects that it already compiled to a binary, so it just runs the compiled version. That takes 30ms or so for me! Big improvement!</p><p>But it's really not that fun to have to figure out that <code>#!build</code> line every time, and I always forget how to call <code>pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages</code> correctly... so there's also a wrapper script called <code>nix-script-haskell</code> that makes this nicer:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script</span><span>-</span><span>haskell
#</span><span>!</span><span>haskellPackages text

{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>And, in addition to the speed boost, we can depend on any package in the Nix ecosystem! For example, here's how you'd add and call <code>jq</code>:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script</span><span>-</span><span>haskell
#</span><span>!</span><span>runtimeInputs jq

</span><span>import </span><span>System.Process

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>do
</span><span>  formatted </span><span>&lt;-
</span><span>    readProcess
      </span><span>"jq"
</span><span>      [</span><span>"--color-output"</span><span>, </span><span>"."</span><span>]
      </span><span>"{</span><span>\"</span><span>name</span><span>\"</span><span>: </span><span>\"</span><span>Atlas</span><span>\"</span><span>, </span><span>\"</span><span>species</span><span>\"</span><span>: </span><span>\"</span><span>kitty cat</span><span>\"</span><span>}"
</span><span>  putStr formatted
</span></code></pre><p>It's also pretty easy to create more wrapping interpreters, so we also ship one for bash. Even though it's not a compiled language, we can cache the nix environment with the exact dependencies the script needs!</p><p>You can get this at <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script">github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script</a>. There are installation instructions in the README, both for standalone use and use within a larger Nix project.</p><p>Enjoy, and let me know if—and how—you use this!</p></article></div>]]>

In my journey of working at several startups, and building my own projects, I've developed a an infrastructure engineering skillset.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020, I was working on a new project and wanted to deploy an Elixir API in a containerized environment and realized that, by default, Elixir apps include a <code>prod.secrets.exs</code> which is used to configure an application in a production environment.</p><p>The standard approach would require us to build docker images on a per-environment basis, which would have to include said secrets within them — this was not an ideal scenario.</p><p>Slab, <a href="https://slab.com/">the knowledge base that democratizes knowledge</a>, discovered the limits of this production configuration. As their team grew, sharing and maintaining this approach became more difficult — as did the security concerns of having secrets in docker images.</p><p>As such, there was a need for a tool that could solve these problems and enable the deployment of docker images to any environment without having hardcoded secrets, as well as solving for config &amp; dev/prod parity in the <a href="https://12factor.net/">twelve factor app methodology</a>.</p><p>Hush demonstrated that it elegantly solved the problem and simplified their environment.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Hush implements Elixir's <code>Config.Provider</code> behavior, giving you a familiar and supported way to configure Elixir applications.</p><p>In this example we can see a production configuration using three providers; AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and System Environment.</p><pre><p><span></span><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>Hush</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Web</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>http:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>port:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"PORT"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>cast:</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"CLOUDSQL_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>RedshiftRepo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"REDSHIFT_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span></p></pre><h2>Features</h2><p>Hush ships, today, with the following features:</p><ul><li>Extensible providers.

                    <p>Since our founding six years ago, it has been a core tenet at Codecov to provide the best code coverage analytics to developers and organizations.</p>
<p>To give our developers a better grasp of the code coverage landscape, we have compiled our most significant learnings from 2020 in our new annual <strong>State of Open Source Code Coverage</strong>. Here is what we found.</p>
<hr>
<h2>General Codecov Usage</h2>
<p>Codecov is dedicated to being free forever for open-source projects. We saw an incredible level of usage on our platform to analyze code coverage on your repositories.</p>




<h2>Code Coverage Usage by Language</h2>
<p>Codecov continues to be language agnostic, ensuring that developers across the board can get code coverage data. We present metrics around language usage by popularity and by the average code coverage for projects of a language.</p>




<h2>Codecov CI Usage</h2>
<p>Codecov continues to work with all CIs in the developer ecosystem. In 2020, however, we saw a meteoric rise in usage of GitHub Actions.</p>


<h2>Featured Open Source Repositories</h2>
<p>Our open-source community continues to be a cornerstone of our product development. We take a step back to showcase and congratulate some of our more popular repositories and their efforts to reach high code coverage.</p>


<h2>Codecov Benefits</h2>
<p>Our goal is to help developers merge their code with confidence. We continually work to see how adding code coverage can benefit projects.</p>

<div>
	<p>The OpenPush project aims to create a free and open source self-hosted replacement for Android Push Notifications usually sent through Google's proprietary Firebase Cloud Messaging platform. This started as a <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/open-source-push-service-fuer-android-apps/">PrototypeFund project</a>. Development is still ongoing.</p>
	<h5>Concept</h5>
	<p><img width="100%" src="https://bubu1.eu/concept.png"></p><p>The green components (PushClient and PushServer) in this high-level overview are part of this project. The red components are different apps and their corresponding webservices using the push functionality.</p>
	<h5>Benefits</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Free Software.</b> FCM is a proprietary service and the Firebase client libs are closed source. This makes projects including fcm libraries effectively non-free software which i.e. cannot be added to the FOSS <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> appstore.</li>
		<li><b>Self-hosted.</b> When self-hosting a open source project, there's no dependency on an external service anymore.</li>
		<li><b>User is in control.</b> A smartphone user can chose a pushserver instance, possibly self-hosted or hosted by a trusted entity.  This instance's url is communicated to the webservice together with the app token to the push-notification producer. Push-notifications will only be sent to this server.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>We live in an industry that celebrates and demands success. From posts that proudly show metrics that are up and to the right, to App Store feature tweets - we love to see others hitting on their current ventures. And why not? It’s fun! I love it too and I’ve shared my own homeruns plenty of times.</p>

<p>But have you noticed that most of the “open startups” are the ones who’ve already found market validation or are on a hot streak? I admit - it’s a lot more fun to share when the getting is good as opposed to when you wake up to zero downloads.</p>

<p>Everyone has started from the bottom though, so today I’d like to take a second and showcase some of the worst things I’ve made from early on in my career that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Made no money</li>
  <li>Won over zero users and</li>
  <li>Whose only fans and reviews were from my immediate family (thanks for that 5 star review Mom!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="christmas-lister">Christmas Lister</h3>
<p>Ah, Christmas Lister. I got the idea to make a Christmas List app on November 15th. It shipped sometime shortly after. This was my first memory of pulling an all nighter on a project.</p>

<p>Just check out that icon:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cd06749d6dd546ff5fe4d499a590da29747a2fa/854e5/assets/images/tts_xmaslister.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cd06749d6dd546ff5fe4d499a590da29747a2fa/854e5/assets/images/tts_xmaslister.png" alt="Christmas Lister App Store Listing"></p>

<p>At the height of skeuomorphism, green developers such as myself wielded Photoshop with might and glory. As I browsed the websites with free .pdfs and stuffed them into my interface, my thirst for more leather bound table views was matched only by my desire for more Christmas Joy to be plastered throughout the app<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/36aa878a89197486883dd4d92a8ed913a1807d0e/4ae87/assets/images/tts_xmaslister1.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/36aa878a89197486883dd4d92a8ed913a1807d0e/4ae87/assets/images/tts_xmaslister1.png" alt="Christmas Lister App Store Listing"></p>

<p>And I remember this one as clear as day. I rushed to my iMac the day after release and saw the sales numbers:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>As in O-N-E! Later that day, I found out it was my manager’s daughter at the Steakhouse I was a server at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My daughter made me buy your crappy app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My old manager, circa early 2010s</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In retrospect, he was right on the nose.</p>

<section>
    <div>
        <p><span>let</span> concatenatedThoughts = <span>"""</span></p>
        <p>Fun fact, this was actually made inside a game engine. I still was just picking up coding at the time, and there was no support for any sort of array or general collection structure. That meant that each and every single slot to make a list with present ideas was hardcoded ahead of time (i.e. var list1present1, etc).</p>
        <p><span>"""</span></p>
    </div>
</section>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> User interfaces require so much thought and less .pdfs, ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing and channel your excitement into <em>less</em> action and more thinking before you fire away.</p>

<h3 id="spend-stack-version-1">Spend Stack Version 1</h3>
<p>My first stab at good ol’ Spend Stack. Before it <a href="https://swiftjectivec.com/a-new-home-for-spend-stack/">became a success</a>, it was a jumbled mess of hidden gestures to navigate, bright and contrasty colors and a nonsensical onboarding flow that had you flying through cartoon clouds (I still was high on those .pdfs from Christmas Lister):</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87c38e45772f71b60f1967a841e7413107288741/c3fb1/assets/images/tts_ss1.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87c38e45772f71b60f1967a841e7413107288741/c3fb1/assets/images/tts_ss1.png" alt="Spend Stack V1 UI"></p>

<p>At this point, I started to trade out my love of free vector graphics for open source projects on Github. If it looked cool, I threw it into my podfile. Never mind if the app needed it, <em>this thing makes freakin’ blur views sooooooo trivial</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>!</p>

<p>I love this app. It clearly demonstrated the burden and the benefit of having an inexperienced dev executing on an actually good idea. I mean that gracefully too. Once you’re past this phase, it’s easy to become a kvetch about rookie mistakes. We’re quick to forget that we made them too.</p>

<p>You don’t go from this:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c12415684a674377f2d2d824263dedc2ed81616/394a6/assets/images/tts_ss2.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c12415684a674377f2d2d824263dedc2ed81616/394a6/assets/images/tts_ss2.png" alt="Spend Stack V1 Lists View"></p>

<p>To this over overnight:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1455b1b07364b592ee3f8e88e5d7ba40b04b5292/f8077/assets/images/tts_ss3.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1455b1b07364b592ee3f8e88e5d7ba40b04b5292/f8077/assets/images/tts_ss3.png" alt="Spend Stack V2 Features"></p>

<p>There are <em>six years</em> between those images.</p>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> A great idea for an app can still result in crappy app, take time to learn about design and holy moses don’t toss in an open source project just because it’s shiny.</p>

<h3 id="halo-timer">Halo Timer</h3>
<p>My best worst effort, by far. My hopes were riding high on this one - I had made some janky apps already, and this time  - I knew better!</p>

<p>To be fair, this one did have a watch extension, quick action short cuts and a user flow that was actually useable. Plus, that parallax effect with the UI on the visor was neat<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d3ce684d2118a3b9598429cd913cd376de22663/06f7b/assets/images/tts_halovisor.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d3ce684d2118a3b9598429cd913cd376de22663/06f7b/assets/images/tts_halovisor.png" alt="The Halo Timer Visor"></p>

<p>So what went wrong here? Let’s pop into multitasking right qui….oh, oh no!</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb17c79281b6348fafcb7314665fa4a7b756f50/19667/assets/images/tts_halomulti.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb17c79281b6348fafcb7314665fa4a7b756f50/19667/assets/images/tts_halomulti.png" alt="The Halo Timer Multitasking on iOS"></p>

<p>Our proclivity to adhere to Master Chief’s visor was both awesome and troublesome. Accessibility was near impossible, as was reframing the .pdf of the UI to other device sizes. Dynamic type just couldn’t hang.</p>

<p>But, what you can <em>see</em> here is that I was learning. Let’s not use any funky gestures to navigate, let’s make it easy to at least get around using a standard <code>UIKit</code> control people know like table views. Progress:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/88c77148d28d19175f163a9156acd04e38de18ea/a3637/assets/images/tts_haloui.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/88c77148d28d19175f163a9156acd04e38de18ea/a3637/assets/images/tts_haloui.png" alt="Halo Timer UI"></p>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> Just because you now <em>know</em> better doesn’t mean you’ll actually <em>make</em> something better - but if you’re here, you’re soooooooo close to getting it!</p>

<h3 id="sowhat">So…..what?</h3>
<p>So why share all of this, aside from the laughs? Is there some wise sage advice I’m inevitably about to drop?</p>

<p>I mean, I dunno? Here’s what I found when writing this:</p>

<p>These projects meant everything to me at the time. I look back at these crash-and-burns and I remember being absolutely brimming with <strong>passion</strong> and pure, unfettered <strong>excitement</strong> as they came together. I mean, these are the projects that made me! I stayed up late, googled non-stop and thought about them all the time.</p>

<p>There’s no way I’d be where I am today if I didn’t dump hours into them. We tend to knock ourselves after launch and think “You know what, that failed. That didn’t work.”</p>

<p>When you’re in it, it feels that way. May I suggest to you that we need to flip that line of thinking from:</p>

<p>“I failed”</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>“I made a freaking thing <em>from nothing</em>, I created this! It may not have worked, but I have 5,433 things to bring to my <em>next</em> thing, and I also know more about this space I tried to launch in.”</p>

<p>In short, you rocked it. Always remember that character is carved out rather than instantly created. Each of these misses can eventually add up to a win.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>When you make things that don’t end up working, and you keep shipping things that don’t sell you might put yourself in a dangerous spot without even realizing it. It becomes <em>fait accompli</em> that even before you spin up your next Xcode project, it’s just not gonna work. If that’s you - keep pushing! You’re close, and I promise you that.</p>

<p>I’m so thankful for the things I made that sucked, because without them I would not have made the things that didn’t.</p>

<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>

Even though only 10% of residents were account holders, hours-long lines formed around the few remaining banks. The country’s fragile power grid failed and left millions of Haitians in the dark. Foreign aid struggled to plug the gap, as distributing cash through traditional means proved difficult and time-consuming — on average, <a href="https://www.betterthancash.org/news/is-cash-the-enemy-of-the-poor">locals waited 12 days</a> to access emergency aid in the midst of Haiti’s worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.</p>



<p>Elie eventually quit her job and threw herself into building a solution. She founded a fintech called HaitiPay which in turn launched Lajan Cash, a trailblazing mobile wallet and payments system that allows anyone with a cellphone to get paid, transfer money, purchase from mom-and-pop stores, or receive remittances from abroad. By dialing a short number, clients can send requests for transfers and payments from their phones, without having to rely on an internet connection. Since its early days, HaitiPay has guaranteed that all transactions were traceable and available between different financial institutions — a level of interoperability that remains an exception to the rule in the country. The service was one of the first in Haiti: an innovative company looking to disrupt a slow-moving and inefficient industry whose shortcomings were painfully obvious. “I said to myself, ‘That’s what I’m going to do for the rest of my life,’” Elie told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, her life-long mission was starting to look a lot like a Silicon Valley–scripted underdog fairy tale. Early on, when she envisaged the company, she jumped through all the ludicrous legal hoops required to create a startup in a heavily regulated market. Then, when she looked to attract customers, her company stood against contenders that had dominated the area for generations but stood as yet unaware of fintech’s potential. If things had panned out as the standard Silicon Valley–endorsed fairy tale claims, disruptive innovation and perseverance should have been enough for Elie to beat the traditional players of the local financial scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, a decade on, it isn’t pioneers like HaitiPay that dominate the fintech scene. Digital wallets and payments are now firmly established in the country’s mostly informal economy. Contrary to the underdog myth that pervades startup culture, the fintech market has been taken over by the establishment — oligarchic banks and telecommunications companies — thanks to archaic regulation and precarious access to funding.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the quake, the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/04/Statement-on-Emergency-Response-to-Haiti">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> rushed to Haiti with millions in emergency aid, three days after the catastrophe. Less than six months later, it had partnered with the U.S. Agency for International Development to offer <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/06/Gates-Foundation-and-USAID-Announce-Innovative-Fund-to-Incentivize-Mobile-Money-Services-in-Haiti">a $10 million grant</a> to mobile money solutions that could streamline fund distribution. An initial $4 million would be split between two companies that proposed the best solutions; the remainder would be given to the winners, if and when they hit at least 100,000 transactions in the country. Contestants had to deliver solutions that weren’t only innovative but could distribute funds to a large user base as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aid announcement highlighted the same idealized case study that Elie had identified months prior: M-Pesa — a Kenyan peer-to-peer payment and money transfer system with <a href="http://www.fsassessment.umd.edu/publications/effects-mpesa-kenya.html">over 9 million customers</a> — was deemed to be the most promising model on which to base Haiti’s nascent fintech sector. At the time, this African startup’s success stood in stark contrast to the hundreds of mobile banking initiatives that had been unable to grow their customer base beyond a handful of users. Soon M-Pesa had put East Africa in the spotlight as the region that, by 2011, concentrated <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/resources/state-of-the-industry-results-from-the-2011-global-mobile-money-adoption-survey/">80% of all mobile money operations worldwide</a>. What became known as the “M-Pesa model” seemed to be Haiti’s ticket out of financial ruin; cellphones appeared to be the perfect substitute to the country’s ailing physical infrastructure. Even better, nearly every Haitian knew how to use one, and most households had at least one device — which could cost <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-haitis-cellphone-networks-failed">as little as $20</a> by 2010, down from $300 in the early aughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gates Foundation and USAID set a high bar for access to the award: at least 100,000 transactions in the first six months. Unsurprisingly, the two final winners were companies with big preexisting customer bases, Jamaica-based Digicel and its main competitor, U.S.-founded Voilà. In conjunction, the two giants covered <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-haitis-cellphone-networks-failed">over 3 million cellphone subscribers</a> on the island and would later merge to create Haiti’s most powerful fintech, MonCash.</p>



<p>MonCash’s overwhelming arrival onto the scene revealed something about its model that global fintech-watchers across the board had failed to realize. Mobile money operations in emerging economies in East Africa or Haiti didn’t succeed only because their approach was particularly innovative. Their success rather depended on very unique local contexts and their ability to scale up. “M-Pesa was based on something that Kenyans were used to: sending airtime to each other as a form of currency, instead of using transfer services like Western Union,” Erin Taylor, an economic anthropologist who researched the early days of mobile money in Haiti, told <em>Rest of World</em>. But the M-Pesa model would only truly experience success when it received backing from important transnational corporations. Subsequent studies have found that its business model depended on widespread adoption to become “<a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/m-pesa-a-mobile-money-success-story-from-kenya/">commercially viable,</a>” which turned out to be easier for a telecommunications company with <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/What-makes-a-successful-mobile-money-implementation.pdf">nearly 80% of market share</a>. The secret to Africa’s most successful fintech lay, not in its disruptive innovation, but rather in its alliance with Safaricom — a local subsidiary associated with telecommunications giant Vodafone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With massive telecommunications behind them, both M-Pesa and MonCash were able to rely on established telecommunications networks to process transactions at virtually no cost for end users. Selling a mobile-based service to millions of customers was no problem to the tried-and-tested companies. With an established consumer base, players like MonCash could make their services as widespread as possible. Those already using Digicel’s services as an operator could easily join its digital wallet and carry out transactions with acquaintances — likely Digicel users as well. Deploying its considerable resources, Digicel positioned agents in Port-au-Prince and other Haitian cities and explained electronic money to customers, by distributing <a href="https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=pt-BR&amp;lr=&amp;id=ve01DwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=m-pesa+%22haiti%22&amp;ots=t_xq0zUTUk&amp;sig=Nv2DSJBcI57hLz25qwEyJGk0XCE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=m-pesa%20%22haiti%22&amp;f=false">pamphlets and comics about it in local Kreyol</a>, soon meeting the transaction target set by the Gates Foundation and USAID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/capturing-the-promise-of-mobile-banking-in-emerging-markets">mass adoption</a> made the giant players bigger but left little room for underdogs, like HaitiPay. To Elie’s great dismay, it turned out that it wasn’t the “M-Pesa model” that promised success in the Haitian fintech scene: being first to market wasn’t enough, you had to be big. MonCash grew on the back of the Safaricom model, supported by the country’s main telecommunications giant. “People would ask if we were like Digicel,” Elie said to <em>Rest of World</em>. “But we were there before, you know?” The Digicel-MonCash fintech solution would go on to grow 15 times faster than Elie’s HaitiPay over the 2010s, reaching over 1.5 million Haitians to her 100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make matters worse, Elie wasn’t merely competing against big telecommunications companies. According to Haitian law, she wasn’t even allowed to take these giants on single-handedly. Any service that relied on electronic money had to operate under an establishment banking partner, so HaitiPay was forced to delay its launch, as it negotiated with its own competitors. She waited nearly two years to receive her stamp of approval from a partner, only to launch in an industry that had been taken over by telecommunications companies months prior. Making the best of a bad situation, Elie found a way to use her legally mandated partner to her advantage: when reaching out to potential customers, she would highlight the bank’s trusted and well-established brand, instead of presenting HaitiPay as a mere newbie.</p>



<p>Unfazed, she set up operations in a small office in Port-au-Prince, designing a tool that worked smoothly amid Haiti’s power outages and expensive internet. Though her system avoided dependence upon internet connectivity, HaitiPay still relied on a proper phone signal — provided, of course, by her telecommunications competitors, Digicel and NatCom. Companies reliant on mobile services, like hers, had to negotiate with the local duopoly to guarantee its operations ran smoothly. “You have to either marry one or the other,” Clifford Reginald Nau, who manages the tech incubator Alpha Haiti, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Elie married both, in order to guarantee that clients from both telecommunications companies could still choose her services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Elie had painstakingly grown her clientele, HaitiPay would go on to benefit from the eventual crashing of the fintech wave in the Caribbean. The industry had become impossible to ignore, creating new <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/david-velez-nubank/">giants valued at $10 billion</a> and disrupting services from <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/okash-microlending-public-shaming/">microlending</a> to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/now-serving-halal-apps/">digital banking</a>.

<p>Many frontend developers might see security as a non-functional concern, that is handled by the security department and that they instead should just focus on feature development. The reality is that learning about security actually <strong>forces you to gain knowledge</strong> about how the <strong>browser works</strong> thus it can <strong>make you a better Angular developer</strong> in general.</p>
<p>High-performing teams, in this day and age, are usually <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/the-three-building-blocks-of-elite-angular-teams/">autonomous DevOps teams</a> and use <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/implementing-continuous-delivery-through-five-steps/">continuous delivery</a> for faster feature delivery. This way of working is only possible if we, frontend developers, also take <strong>responsibility for the security</strong> as we build features.</p>

<p>This post aims to give you the know-how to&nbsp;<strong>build security into your feature development</strong>&nbsp;and become a better developer by gaining a higher understanding of the browser and security concepts that are relevant for Angular developers.</p>
<p>I will go through the&nbsp;<strong>OWASP top 10 security threats</strong>&nbsp;that relate to Angular development and explain how to mitigate each one in this post.</p>
<h2>What is OWASP top 10?</h2>
<p>The OWASP top ten is the top ten list of web security risks from the Open Web Application Security Project foundation. It consists of a group of security experts who release a top 10 list of relevant security risks every 3-4 years which many companies use to focus their security effort.</p>
<h2>OWASP 2013 to 2017</h2>
<p>The OWASP top ten has evolved through the years and has gotten rid of a couple of security risks, that are no longer relevant enough to make the top ten in the 2017 edition.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/owaspdocumen.png?zoom=2&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for owasp top 10 2020 vs 2017" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/owaspdocumen.png?zoom=2&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of these threats, the ones that relate to Angular development are:</p>
<ol><li><a href="#csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li><li><a href="#sensitive-data-exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></li><li><a href="#xxs">Cross-Site Scripting</a></li><li><a href="#using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></li></ol>
<p>The other threats are mostly handled on the backend and are not covered in this post.</p>
<h2>Basic security concepts</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some basic security concepts to improve our understanding of how the browser works.</p>
<h3>Same-Origin Policy</h3>
<p>The same-origin policy (SOP) is a security concept <strong>that limits how one origin can interact with other origins</strong>.<br>An origin consists of a protocol, domain and port:</p>
<p><code>protocol://domain:port</code> eg. <code>https://google.com:443</code></p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="295" src="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300%2C86&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C221&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=600%2C173&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=1154&amp;ssl=1 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300%2C86&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C221&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=600%2C173&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=1154&amp;ssl=1 1154w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>In a same-origin policy, <strong>reads</strong> are typically <strong>prohibited </strong>across origins and <strong>writes</strong> are typically <strong>allowed</strong> across origins.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>What?</strong></td><td><strong>Mostly</strong> <strong>Allowed</strong>?</td><td><strong>Allowed</strong> <strong>Operations</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>writes</strong></td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>Links, redirects, form submissions</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>reads</strong></td><td><strong>No</strong></td><td>None</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>embedding</strong></td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>Scripts, CSS, Images</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>SOP: What is allowed?</figcaption></figure>
<p>For <strong>writes</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, <strong>redirects</strong>, and <strong>form submissions </strong>are <strong>allowed</strong>. The general rule of thumb with SOP and cross-origin <strong>writes</strong> is; <span>everything that you can do with an <strong>HTML form</strong> is <strong>allowed</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The general rule of thumb with SOP and cross-origin <strong>writes</strong> is; everything that you can do with an <strong>HTML form</strong> is <strong>allowed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> from another origin is <span>not allowed per default</span> (more on CORS headers soon). Doing so will result in this error (you try to fetch from another origin):<br></p>

<p><strong>Embedding</strong> is generally <strong>allowed</strong> when embedding scripts, CSS, and images thus are normally a common attack surface as well (as we will see later).</p>
<h3>Implicit and explicit authentication</h3>
<p><strong>Implicit authentication</strong> means the authentication is based on something the browser automatically (implicitly) sends on each request. This could be <strong>cookies</strong>, <strong>HTTP basic auth</strong>, and <strong>TLS client certificates</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem with this kind of authentication is, it is possible for an attacker, to do <strong>authenticated writes</strong> on behalf of a user if the servers are not explicitly protecting against this (eg. cross-site request forgery attacks, as we will soon see more about).</p>
<p><strong>Explicit authentication</strong> means manually (explicitly) sending the authentication token by the developer such as via an HTTP header. The most common way to do this is using <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/creating-an-openid-connect-system-with-angular-8-and-identityserver4-oidc-part-1/" data-type="post" data-id="106">OAuth bearer tokens</a> in the headers.</p>
<h3>Cross-origin resource sharing</h3>
<p>Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism, controlled by HTTP response headers on a server, for <strong>allowing origins to perform</strong> <strong>“non-HTML form compliant” requests</strong> to the server. On such a request, the browser will first do a <strong>preflight </strong>request, for loading the CORS headers and then do the actual request.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/729/1*JBbctZQfohc-YR6yUn_HMQ.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for cors preflight" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/729/1*JBbctZQfohc-YR6yUn_HMQ.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>The browser <strong>automatically</strong> sends the <strong>preflight</strong> (OPTIONS), if this is a cross-origin non-form request, for reading the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. The client will proceed with the actual request if the header is present and valid (needs to either contain the client’s origin or *).</p>
<p>Here’s an <strong>example</strong> <strong>preflight request</strong> and <strong>response</strong>:</p>

<p>A “non-HTML form compliant” request, is a request that <strong>contains custom headers</strong> and <code><strong>content-type</strong></code> other than the standard HTML form content types: </p>
<p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>,&nbsp;<code>multipart/form-data</code>, or&nbsp;<code>text/plain</code></p>
<p>The best practice with cross-origin resource handling is to <strong>whitelist</strong> the origins, which are permitted to call the server instead of using wildcard *.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong>: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code></p>
<p><strong>Do</strong>: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://somedomain.com</code></p>
<h2 id="csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>
<p>CSRF attacks involve the attacker taking advantage of<strong> implicit authentication</strong> such as a <strong>session cookie</strong> to make you do an <strong>authenticated request to a site</strong>.<br>CSRF attacks are handled automatically by many frameworks and mechanisms such as CMS and OAuth2 so is no longer a big enough threat to make it in 2017 OWASP top ten but is still worth knowing how to mitigate against in Angular apps.</p>
<p>A typical CSRF attack involves an attacker hosting a site, which is <strong>doing requests to a target website</strong>, once we user visits the attacker site. This will work if the target site uses <strong>implicit authentication</strong> and the user is <strong>already authenticated</strong> on the target site (and there is no CSRF protection).</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CSRF_visio.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CSRF steps illustration" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CSRF_visio.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Due to SOP this attack will only work when:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Write</strong> operation (can be GET or POST)</li><li><strong>Standard</strong> HTML <strong>form content types</strong>:<ul><li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li><li>multipart/form-data</li><li>text/plain</li></ul></li><li><strong>Implicit authentication</strong></li><li>Only <strong>standard headers</strong></li></ul>
<p>If the server contains <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> we would only require implicit authentication to do a CSRF attack (did I tell you to not use wildcards with your CORS?) as non-standard headers and non-form content-type are what is causing a CORS preflight to be necessary.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>User visits attacker site, which performs a form request to <strong>bank.com</strong> in which the user is authenticated using a session cookie. The site can now trigger eg. a payment on behalf of the user’s account.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>For the most part, CSRF is not a security threat anymore as <strong>most Angular apps use explicit authentication such as OAuth2</strong>.</p>
<p>If your app is using implicit authentication eg. using a cookie, then the simplest way to protect yourself against CSRF attacks is to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Send a custom header</strong> on each request (client)</li><li><strong>Verify the custom header</strong> is present on each request (server)</li></ol>
<p>Because custom headers can’t be sent across domains without a CORS preflight this will protect you against CSRF if you are not using <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>.</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Send a custom header</strong> on each request (client)</h4>
<p>Angular’s <code>HttpClient</code> <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http#security-xsrf-protection">automatically sends a X-XSRF-TOKEN</a> header on each request when performing a mutating request, such as POST.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Verify a custom header</strong> is visible on each request (server)</h4>
<p>For Node Express servers, this is easily handled by the middleware <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/csurf.html">csurf</a> which will <strong>check for the CSRF header being present</strong> on each request.</p>
<h2 id="sensitive-data-exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
<p>Sensitive data exposure is about having sensitive data read by an attacker, either while in transit, such as for a <strong>man-in-the-middle </strong>attack, or by tampering with the requested page eg. if the <strong>DNS is hacked</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossless,ret_img,w_750/https://www.internetsecurity.tips/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-Sensitive-Data-Exposure.png?ssl=1" alt="sensitive data exposure" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossless,ret_img,w_750/https://www.internetsecurity.tips/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-Sensitive-Data-Exposure.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h3>Man in the middle</h3>
<p>A <strong>man in the middle</strong> attack involves a <strong>mediating network device</strong>, that is able to read unencrypted data and tamper with the returned payload when a site is requested.</p>
<figure><img src="https://mikethetesternz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mitm.jpeg?w=700" alt="Image result for sensitive data exposure" data-lazy-src="https://mikethetesternz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mitm.jpeg?w=700&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>A man in the middle attack can occur even with HTTPS as we will see:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Requesting website</strong>, where <strong>first request</strong> per default is an <strong>http</strong> request</li><li><strong>Requests HTTP page</strong> on <strong>server</strong></li><li><strong>Server redirects</strong> to <strong>HTTPS</strong></li><li>Man in the middle <strong>requests HTTPS page</strong></li><li>The <strong>server responds</strong> with an HTTPS response</li><li>Interceptor <strong>rewrites HTTPS to HTTP</strong> and can <strong>inject</strong> <strong>malicious</strong> <strong>code</strong></li><li>The clients future requests are now <strong>HTTP</strong> can now be <strong>sniffed</strong> and <strong>tampered</strong> with by the <strong>man in the middle</strong></li></ol>

<p>The basic problem here is the <strong>first request is unencrypted</strong> and can thus be tampered with by the man in the middle.<br>There are two solutions to this; <strong>VPN</strong> and <strong>HSTS</strong> header.</p>
<p>VPN is not a security mechanism you can set up on your own site, so let’s focus on the <strong>HSTS header</strong>.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The solution is to ensure that the <strong>first request is HTTPS</strong> by using <strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security</strong> <strong>headers</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this, you make your frontend server return a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header.</p>

<p>By setting the expire-time more than one year, and setting includeSubDomains and preload, the site will be part of the browsers preload list which is a <strong>hardcoded list in browsers</strong> ensuring the site will only be requested over HTTPS. You can check if your domain is in the preload list <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">here</a>. Otherwise, the clients will <strong>perform an HTTP</strong> <strong>request</strong> every time the <strong>HSTS header expires</strong>.</p>
<h3>Hacked CDN</h3>
<p>Hacked DNS involves the attacker getting control over a DNS server and is able to point domains to other servers eg. their own malicious website.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/DNS-Hijacking.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for hacked dns" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/DNS-Hijacking.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>This malicious website might be, UI-wise, a clone of the original site but containing logic for eg. sniffing logins and credit cards.</p>

<p>The solution to protecting your users against compromised DNS is to use the <strong>integrity</strong> attribute in the script tag, loading the DNS resource, which is a checksum mechanism to ensure the integrity of what the DNS serves:<br></p>

		<p>At Replit we believe that computers give people superpowers. With computers, anyone who's willing to learn can spend more of their time on creative invention rather than tedious drudgery. They help us automate repetitive tasks and build on the collective knowledge of all the great thinkers, inventors, artists, and teachers who came before us. </p>
<p>Computer science teachers around the world are bestowing these superpowers upon the next generation of creators and builders. We built <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Replit Teams for Education</a> for them, and today we're officially taking Teams for Education out of beta. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wgl_ERg23O4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Sign up for a free trial</a> if you haven't already!</p>
<p>Thank you teachers for beta testing Teams, for giving us invaluable product feedback, for helping one another out as part of a vibrant and diverse community of Replers, and for being a part of the history of computers.</p>
<p>William Gibson is famous for saying way back in 1992, that "the future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." If we asked you a year ago, you may have said we were already living in the computer age, or even that we had been for decades. But then in early 2020 COVID-19 happened and everything went "remote" and we all took a collective leap even further into the future. Today it's more obvious than ever that for children (and adults!) to participate in the riches of the new economy, they need to be able to design, control, and program the machines that we all use all day, every day.</p>
<p>On this vision to build powerful &amp; approachable tools that expand access to computing superpowers, Replit raised a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/seriesa">$20 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020. We're using the funds both to make learning more engaging for teachers and students and also to make work more fun and creative for professional software developers. We believe that the same things that make programming easier for beginners will also unlock productivity for experts. And when students know that they aren't just in a sandboxed, toy environment, but instead can use real-world tools and collaborate in real-time with their peers, they'll learn better.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/multiplayerart.png" alt="replit multiplayer art"></p>
<p>We've been working towards this vision since Amjad and Haya started Replit in 2016. And the initial beta release of Teams for Education over the summer of 2020 was a major step forward in that direction. From the start, early adopters like Toni loved the real-time multiplayer collaboration with their students, seeing how Replit could transform their classrooms.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> absolute game changer for coding.

<p>But there was much more to do before Teams would be ready to graduate from beta. We listened to our teachers. Then we rolled up our sleeves and started building fast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/education-privacy">privacy compliance</a> (FERPA, COPPA, GDPR, and more)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">code annotations for feedback</a></li>

<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/unit-tests">built-in unit tests for Java, Python, and Javascript</a></li>
<li>project overview and reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're going to keep on shipping! In the coming days and weeks, look out for live handraising to get help, project due dates, easier billing and team organization, major updates to annotations (now called threads), and more. If there's something else you want us to build, <a href="https://replit.canny.io/teams-for-education">let us know</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/threads.png" alt="threads"></p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who's been teaching with Teams for helping us set the product direction. There's still more to do, but Teams for Education has finally reached a point where we're proud to officially release it. We're excited to keep hearing success stories from teachers like Michele and Pete.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It. Will. Change. Your. Life.

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have been using teams with my 9 Higher pupils this week and it is a game changer - especially when remote coding.

<p>But it's not just these couple teachers. In the past 7 months of the beta, we've reached ~1,000 paying Teams customers (and thousands more currently on free trials). We're serving elementary schools, high schools, colleges and universities, bootcamps, nonprofits, and every type of educational institution. And the schools using Replit are incredibly diverse with over 30% majority minority and over half with &gt;45% of their students on free or reduced-price lunch.</p>
<p>With so much collective brainpower and experience across our community, we're working hard to connect teachers to one another to share best practices. If you haven't already, <a href="https://repl.it/talk/all">join Repl talk</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/replitforcseducation">our teachers' group on Facebook</a>. We'll be attending the <a href="https://sigcse2021.sigcse.org/">SIGCSE conference</a> in March and would love to see you at <a href="https://repl.it/sigcse2021">our presentation</a>. We'll be at <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/csta-2021">CSTA</a> over the summer as well. More details to come. We'll be resuming "office hours" (video call sessions with our team) in the coming weeks and sending a survey to ask your time preferences. And to help us out on all these fronts, we'll soon be adding another teacher from the community to our team. </p>
<p>Finally, the Replit team is doing a book club, and we'd love to have you join. We're reading <a href="http://friendlyorangeglow.com/">"The Friendly Orange Glow"</a>, which tells the story of programming education and early cyberculture from the 1960s through the early 90s. If you'd like to read the book and join our next conversation, just email <a href="https://blog.repl.it/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1a6a7b6e687379715a687f6a7634736e"><span data-cfemail="9dedfce9eff4fef6ddeff8edf1b3f4e9">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> and I'll send you the details!</p>
<p>It's been an exciting journey building Teams for Education, and there's so much more to come. You can <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">learn more and sign up for a free trial here</a>. Happy coding!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, March 1, 2021</em></p><p>When I was optimizing <a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/elm-csv-package-and-talk/">elm-csv</a>, I noticed that Elm's <code>String.startsWith</code> is implemented using JavaScript's <code>indexOf</code> method. It looks something like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>haystack</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>) {
  </span><span>return </span><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>needle</span><span>) </span><span>=== </span><span>0
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>This strikes me as inefficient! Doesn't that mean that if <code>haystack</code> doesn't begin with <code>needle</code>, it'll still look through the whole string? That seems to waste a lot of cycles on work after we already know the result.</p><p>After thinking about it for a little bit, I imagined a faster way:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>haystack</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>) {
  </span><span>return </span><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>.length) </span><span>=== </span><span>needle
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>But, I didn't know for sure if it would be faster, so I started measuring things. After a few benchmarks things were looking promising! I found that <code>String.prototype.slice</code> and <code>String.prototype.length</code> operate in more-or-less constant time, and that <code>===</code>, while not constant-time, is heavily optimized.</p><p><em>Hypothetically</em>, I thought, this means that a <code>slice</code>-based implementation of <code>startsWith</code> could run much quicker than scanning through the whole string with <code>indexOf</code>.</p><h2 id="chrome-uses-actual-magic-in-their-strings">Chrome Uses Actual Magic in Their Strings</h2><p>But just to make sure my intuition about <code>indexOf</code> being slow was correct, I decided to benchmark that as well. Specifically, I decided to benchmark how long browsers took to find a single character in a string that doesn't contain the character:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>).</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>"d"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre><p>I expected that every time I multiplied <code>size</code> by 10, I should see roughly a 10x slowdown in operations per second. But then…</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>866,026,834</td><td>869,256,882</td><td>858,563,862</td><td>865,370,315</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>43,557,275</td><td>44,947,174</td><td>41,059,919 (-8.65%)</td><td>16,831,928 (-59.01%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>49,240,581</td><td>34,661,639 (-29.61%)</td><td>7,162,615 (-79.01%)</td><td>877,449 (-87.75%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Chrome has…&nbsp;NO REAL SLOWDOWN? WHAT? This data suggests that Chrome can find a substring in any length string in constant time. How is that even possible?</p><p>At this point, I felt pretty out of my depth, and decided I needed to ask my friend <a href="https://github.com/lukewestby">Luke Westby, Real-Life Computer Genius™</a>, what was going on. He knew right where to look and figured out that <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/dc712da548c7fb433caed56af9a021d964952728/src/strings/string-search.h#L194">Chrome has a special optimization for single-character search strings in <code>indexOf</code></a>. In other words, people have hand-tuned V8 over the years to go ridiculously fast in all sorts of situations, and this is one of them.</p><p>Well, OK, let's try finding some multi-character string instead. I used "nope", which doesn't trigger this optimization, but still fails to match "abc". Does that give us a result that matches my intuition?</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>885,211,831</td><td>863,845,523 (-2.41%)</td><td>849,821,335 (-1.62%)</td><td>837,391,727 (-1.46%)</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>58,648,716</td><td>44,107,472 (-24.79%)</td><td>40,529,513 (-8.11%)</td><td>16,768,019 (-58.63%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>102,071,445</td><td>26,242,114 (-74.29%)</td><td>4,212,339 (-83.95%)</td><td>467,329 (-88.91%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's <em>kinda</em> like what I expected, but Chrome is still incredibly fast at this! Well, OK, that's fine. Good for them. But at this point I got curious (and a little devious): how can I defeat Chrome's optimizations? What is the worst-case scenario that they can't possibly have handled already?</p><p>I tried to imagine the algorithm that you'd have to write to implement <code>indexOf</code> and came up with something like this:</p><ol><li>Look at the first character in <code>haystack</code>.</li><li>If it matches the first character in <code>needle</code>, look at the next pairs of characters in the two strings one by one.</li><li>If you get to the end of <code>needle</code> and they all match, you've found the index.</li><li>But if one pair doesn't match, you've got to start over at the next character in <code>haystack</code>.</li></ol><p>With that in mind, what's combination of <code>needle</code> and <code>haystack</code> would perform the worst? I think it's any pair of strings where <code>haystack</code> is all but the last character of <code>needle</code> repeated over and over. So, maybe a benchmark like this?</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>).</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>"abcd"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre><p>That can never succeed, but it'll make the browser do a lot of extra work reading the initially-matching "abc" over and over. Let's see the results:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>877,221,230</td><td>863,929,216 (-1.52%)</td><td>688,398,676 (-20.32%)</td><td>125,023 (-99.98%)</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>61,384,762</td><td>12,874,505 (-79.03%)</td><td>1,366,202 (-89.39%)</td><td>137,245 (-89.95%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>100,546,438</td><td>25,948,095 (-74.19%)</td><td>4,170,375 (-83.93%)</td><td>467,753 (-88.78%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finally, Chrome has similar performance to other browsers. I don't think this is representative of real workloads, but even so Chrome performs admirably. Hats off to the V8 team for this implementation, but honestly, it's good to know they're still mortal!</p><h2 id="comparing-the-implementations">Comparing the Implementations</h2><p>So now that we know more about the component pieces involved in this optimization (for example, knowing to avoid single-character test strings), we can check if <code>slice</code> actually gives us a real-world speedup. In setting this up, I decided to go for the middle of the road to try and benchmark the browsers under something that you can kind of squint at and think "yeah, that will probably happen reasonably often in real life." In this case, that meant setup looked like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack </span><span>= </span><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)
</span><span>needle </span><span>= </span><span>"abc"
</span></code></pre><p>Then the <code>indexOf</code> and <code>slice</code> benchmarks looked like the code at the top of this post:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>needle</span><span>) </span><span>=== </span><span>0
</span></code></pre><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>.length) </span><span>=== </span><span>needle
</span></code></pre><p>That gave me these results:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>indexOf</th><th>slice</th><th>% Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.192</td><td>871,312,454</td><td>870,810,291</td><td>-0.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 86.0</td><td>32,428,394</td><td>46,845,953</td><td>+44.46%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>430,854,455</td><td>1,352,674,261</td><td>+213.95%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note that Chrome and Firefox had released new versions between me testing <code>indexOf</code> and this test. I kept the old data here because it doesn't seem to have changed the performance, but I just want to be up front that the versions are different!</p><p>Anyway, that said: looks like a result within the margin of error for Chrome (around 0.4%), but a reasonable speedup for Firefox and a big win for Safari.</p><p>What does the failure case look like? (Same <code>haystack</code>, but <code>needle = "nope"</code>):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>indexOf</th><th>slice</th><th>% Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.192</td><td>874,951,212</td><td>854,116,367</td><td>-2.44%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>31,026,729</td><td>22,180,114</td><td>-28.51%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>4,189,768</td><td>1,508,770,435</td><td>+35,910.83%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This time, Chrome has a slowdown greater than the measurement error, which surprised me! Same with Firefox, but to a larger degree. But the real story here is Safari, which can now do this operation over 1.5 billion times per second. <em>Billion!</em> What even!</p><h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is It Worth It?</h2><p>So, with all that measurement done, is this optimization worth it? I'm actually not really sure. This is basically nothing in Chrome but means making some real performance tradeoffs in Firefox. And, even though it looks like a huge win in Safari, my claims can only be as strong as the underlying assumptions I'm making in choosing test data. So, just to be explicit about that:</p><ul><li>These benchmarks assume that <code>haystack</code> is a long-ish string (300 characters.) Many of the gains we see here are erased when the strings are short. Safari in particular, drops to only about a 100% gain in the failure case with a shorter string (I tested at 3, 30, 150 characters, all with similar results.)</li><li>The <code>needle</code> strings are neither a single character nor a worst-case scenario for <code>indexOf</code> performance.</li><li>Success and failure cases are equally likely. We can't make any assumption other than that at the runtime level, although we could make a good argument to switch this for individual applications. For example, we could choose to use <code>slice</code> in an application where we expected most checks on <code>startsWith</code> would succeed, since that's basically a wash in Chrome and much faster in Firefox and Safari.</li><li>We care about browsers based on global total share instead of splitting out into desktop or mobile. This is another area where you could make different decisions at the application level: if the users of your app skew more towards using Chrome or more towards Safari, this payoff for this optimization gets better or worse.</li></ul><p>Of course, if you can measure that your application <em>would</em> benefit from this optimization, go ahead and do it yourself! Calling <code>String.slice 0 (String.length haystack) === needle</code> has some overhead in Elm (due to equality having different semantics) but you may still able to get the majority of the benefits if your users are mostly using Safari or you're running iOS webkit views or something like that. Just make sure to actually measure it! Optimizations at this level can be helpful, but they're more often dwarfed by DOM stuff in the runtime.</p><p>As for me: at this point, I'm not going to make a PR to <code>elm/core</code> with this improvement, even I intended to when I set out. However, I found it interesting to look into these things, and I learned a lot about how strings are optimized in various browsers, so I'm gonna call it a win overall.</p></article></div>]]>

March 2, 2021 | https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Kubernetes (k8s) has been all the rage for the last few years because application orchestration has become a de facto table-stakes requirement for production workloads running containers. “Containerising” applications is <em>relatively</em> straightforward, and most DevOps engineers worth their salt can create a few Dockerfiles and build images in a pipeline that are ready to run. But where do you “run” your Docker containers? And which versions do you deploy? And how do all the containers talk to each other? This is where orchestration comes into play and where a few options are proposed by large vendors. There are two main options available at the time of this writing: Elastic Container Service (ECS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Kubernetes which is offered by all the Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) providers, including even AWS.</p><p>The hope is that orchestration will allow companies to deliver their containerised applications to test and integration environments quickly and painlessly. The ideal scenario is that it “just works”, that is, you would snap your fingers and wait a few minutes before you see your application running in front of you. Ideally, you’d only need to specify the minimum information necessary to run your application: name, framework, dependencies, and so forth, preferably read out from existing configuration files you already have available. That’s the hope anyway.</p><p>Obviously, from the title, we are focusing on Kubernetes, mainly because it is available everywhere and mainly because the only <em>other</em> option is ECS which only proves the point of our thesis that Kubernetes is hard to use because AWS came up with their own solution that is <em>supposed to be</em> easier. But why is it so hard to use? How long would it reasonably take to get your application(s) running in K8s?? And why isn’t it easier?</p><h2 id="kubernetes-infrastructure-is-hard">Kubernetes Infrastructure Is Hard</h2><p>We always start with the infrastructure even though most companies wouldn’t build their own Kubernetes clusters themselves. If you were ever going to use a managed infrastructure service, K8s would be at the top of the list. I’m sure there are a few people who start up <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" title="Minikube documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">minikube</a> on their laptops and say to themselves, “Wow, this is easy! I can do this myself!!” This reminds me of people who start up an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html" title="Elasticsearch getting started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a> container on their laptop and say, “Wow, we should implement this for our website!!” Fast forward to a production launch six months or a year later and the simple “We can do this ourselves” mantra turns into “I wish we didn’t have to do this anymore.”</p><p>If you were truly going to build your own Kubernetes cluster, you’d need to build all the control plane servers and services on your bare-metal or Virtual Machines (VMs) from an IaaS of choice, and then tie them all together with some fancy networking configuration to separate control-plane traffic from container traffic. You’d need to configure and run all of the control plane software and get them all talking to each other, running stably and monitored properly. Perversely, you’d be orchestrating the containers that orchestrate the application, but without a lot of orchestration! The fancy mirage that’s presented when you run minikube or Docker Desktop on Windows hides all the inception of running a container orchestration system using containers.</p><p>We haven’t even gotten to the complications of setting up ingresses (which are just nginx instances, usually) and load balancers that sit on top of or next to the control plane stack. A lot of the time, you’ll feel like you are creating a whole infrastructure just for your infrastructure to run (which isn’t unusual, but definitely doesn’t feel better than trying to orchestrate things yourself). We also haven’t gotten into the Role Based Authentication Controls and network policies that need to be set to support more than a single application or stack running in one cluster. The number of configuration points and server-side setups start to mount quickly and we haven’t even started orchestrating applications yet, which is the whole point of the orchestration system we’re supposed to be setting up.</p><p>And let’s suppose that you really do wade out into this deep North Atlantic Ocean of huge waves and death-inducing freezing waters, and build yourself a production-worthy ship that can orchestrate your containers into an actual application. You look back up at your calendar and it’s been six months or a year since you started, and you’re just now deploying a control plane that says, “Hello World!” You think you’re successful and you’re about to celebrate when you check the releases section on the website and now you have a new version of k8s to deploy!!!</p><p>I hear what you’re saying, “We’re <code>large company</code> and we have <code>lots of</code> DevOps engineers who are <code>top decile</code> of engineering talent in the whole world. We can handle all the heavy lifting. You’re just a whining, jealous baby.” I see you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDm9iNkLyPI" title="Datadog on Kubernetes presentation video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Datadog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg" title="Ticketmaster presents the keynote at Kubecon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ticketmaster</a>. (By the way, your accusations of jealousy might be correct. At the end of my good friend Justin Dean’s keynote speech where he shows the slides with all the team members, my picture should have been up there — but I had left the team two years earlier.) For everyone else, we all just decide to not spend six months or a year trying to build our control plane and start up our IaaS provider’s managed service and cross our fingers and pray.</p><h2 id="k8s-yaml-aint-markup-language">K8s YAML Ain’t Markup Language</h2><p>If you’ve skipped ahead and just started up a managed k8s cluster, you’re still in for a long and tedious journey wading into a deep sea of confusing YAML. YAML is to text what James Joyce’s <em><a href="https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/fw01.htm" title="Read Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Finnegan’s Wake</a></em> is to English. If you close one eye, use only your left pinky and right thumb to follow some brail, put your feet into ballet’s fifth position, and then recite World War II codes under your breath, then you will easily see that YAML is quite a breeze to comprehend. Once you get the hang of it, it’s like riding a bicycle over a frozen lake on centimeter-thin ice with rabid wolves chasing you. It’s as easy as trying to crash the Ancient Aliens cocktail party held in Fort Knox on gold smuggling days.</p><p>Look, it’s not actually that hard, right? Let’s say a guy walks up to you on the street. He’s a k8s expert and he’s going to show you how easy the “hello world” web service deployment is. The conversation goes like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>You: “Oh, I see. Yes, I like it.”</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1beta1.”</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>You: “Uh, okay.

You can use v1 as of k8s 1.9.</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>It’s actually removed in 1.16, but I wonder how many people have never</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>updated.”</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Him: “Start over.”</span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>You: “Stop with the Kinds everywhere!”</span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1”</span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>You: “This again.”</span></p><p><span>22</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>You: “Huh??”</span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span></p><p><span>27</span><span>Him: “selector:”</span></p><p><span>28</span><span></span></p><p><span>29</span><span>You: “No.”</span></p><p><span>30</span><span></span></p><p><span>31</span><span>Him: “matchLabels:”</span></p><p><span>32</span><span></span></p><p><span>33</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>34</span><span></span></p><p><span>35</span><span>Him: “app: nginx”</span></p><p><span>36</span><span></span></p><p><span>37</span><span>You: “That’s nearly the first thing I’ve understood about this so far.”</span></p><p><span>38</span><span></span></p><p><span>39</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>40</span><span></span></p><p><span>41</span><span>You: “Again?”</span></p><p><span>42</span><span></span></p><p><span>43</span><span>Him: “containers:”</span></p><p><span>44</span><span></span></p><p><span>45</span><span>You: “Okay, now we’re getting somewhere.”</span></p><p><span>46</span><span></span></p><p><span>47</span><span>Him: “image: nginx:1.14.2”</span></p><p><span>48</span><span></span></p><p><span>49</span><span>You: “Hmm.”</span></p><p><span>50</span><span></span></p><p><span>51</span><span>Him: “ports:”</span></p><p><span>52</span><span></span></p><p><span>53</span><span>You: “Aiiiiieeee.”</span></p><p><span>54</span><span></span></p><p><span>55</span><span>Him: “containerPort: 80”</span></p><p><span>56</span><span></span></p><p><span>57</span><span>You: “I’m going home.

Try reading two k8s yaml examples and then generate one yourself from scratch. Even better, every day try a <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Practice a code kata daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code kata</a> practice of writing working and deployable configurations to Kubernetes.</p><p>I DARE YOU.</p><h2 id="copy-paste-aint-code">Copy Paste Ain’t Code</h2><p>I’m still chuckling over the previous section. I have to chuckle because this is the daily pain of my day-to-day existence and facing that pain directly is like standing in front of a bus being driven by Keanu Reeves on the freeway. The only thing that keeps my nose going back to the grindstone is the realization that working with NodeJs would be worse. The problem is that the Kubernetes docs are pretty good. You copy-paste some hello world examples and the outputs look like they work. You start to get pretty good at using kubectl. You can see vague shapes and outlines in YAML. You’re starting to gain confidence that you might be able to do something useful.</p><p>“Let’s try to move our application into Kubernetes!” you yell into the air as you emerge dripping wet from your bathtub wrapped only in a towel, like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-archimede/" title="Learn about the Archimedes fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Archimedes</a> sprinting through the streets of Syracuse. “We’ll just copy-paste some sections from here and here and put them there and there, and we’ll have our app running in no time,” you breathlessly explain to your coworkers. “Does it work?!” they excitedly ask. “Not yet. I mean, no. I need to indent the section and remove one piece that is not used in this spec. Then I need to decide if we use a deployment or a daemonset, but it’s almost there. I swear!”</p><p>First of all, put on some clothes. I’m all for taking a bath while thinking about kubernetes YAML files, but you need to get dressed afterward. Also, if you drop your Macbook Air into the bath with you, the results can be electrifying. I know. Second, here’s a riddle for you: how many YAML files do you think you need to run and deploy your application? Good thing that some people have ten fingers and ten toes because that’s probably how many you’ll need. And they’re all related but not really. You can copy-paste sections around if you’re adventurous and gullible, but you have no idea if the sections are compatible. There are only four required fields, all of which are gibberish, and everything goes under <code>spec:</code> (including <code>spec:</code>). Most of the sections are duplicated but only slightly. They vary microscopically in ways that matter macroscopically.</p><p>Copying and pasting is a wonderful art, and I’ve personally worked my entire adult career that way. I gleefully admit my whole output in life is like a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteNote" title="Example of a Ransome Note trope from movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ransom note</a> cut from stack overflow and documentation examples.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Taproot is a proposed upgrade to Bitcoin which will bring several new features and benefits to Bitcoin users. The Bitcoin community is hoping to activate Taproot in the near future, although its activation path is still unclear.</p>
<p>The Taproot upgrade is actually composed of three <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/b/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip/">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)</a> which define three distinct upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol: Schnorr Signatures, Taproot, and Tapscript. However, these three upgrades are known as the Taproot upgrade, and BIPs 340, 341, and 342 are often collectively referred to as BIP Taproot. Together, these upgrades introduce new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways of transferring bitcoin.</p>
<h2 id="schnorr-signatures">Schnorr Signatures</h2>
<p>BIP 340 introduces Schnorr signatures for use in Bitcoin. Schnorr signatures will bring several benefits to Bitcoin users, including superior privacy, lower fees, and more flexible multisig.</p>
<p>This BIP also specifies how Schnorr public keys and signatures are to be encoded for use in Bitcoin. Public keys used for Schnorr signatures are 32 bytes long, compared to ECDSA’s 33-byte public keys. Additionally, Schnorr signatures are 64 bytes long, compared to ECDSA signatures, which range from 70-72 bytes. These small space savings offer fee savings to Bitcoin users who adopt Taproot.</p>
<p>➤ <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-schnorr-signatures/">Learn more about Schnorr signatures.</a></p>

<h2 id="taproot">Taproot</h2>
<p>While BIP 340 defines the specification for generating and encoding Schnorr signatures and public keys, BIP 341 defines how Bitcoin’s protocol will integrate Schnorr signatures. Specifically, Bitcoin Script must be updated to also evaluate Schnorr signatures. Taproot also integrates <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkelized-alternative-script-tree-mast/">Merkelized Alternative Script Types (MAST)</a>, which allow users to lock outputs to multiple scripts.</p>
<div>

  

  
  <p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/icons/lightbulb.svg" alt="Key Fact: Pay-to-Taproot outputs are version 1 SegWit outputs, and all Taproot transactions are SegWit transactions."></p><p>
    Pay-to-Taproot outputs are version 1 SegWit outputs, and all Taproot transactions are SegWit transactions.
  </p>
  
</div>
<h2 id="pay-to-taproot-p2tr">Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR)</h2>
<p>Taproot also introduces a new script type, a way of spending bitcoin. Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) allows users to pay to either a Schnorr public key <strong>or</strong> the <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkle-root/">Merkle root</a> of a variety of other scripts. Using this new script type, a user can create a UTXO which can be unlocked and spent by either the owner of the private key or anyone who can satisfy the requirements of any script within the Merkle tree.</p>
<h3 id="key-aggregation">Key Aggregation</h3>
<p>Schnorr’s key aggregation feature enables this flexible functionality. When bitcoin is sent to a P2TR output, it is locked to a single public key, called Q. However, this public key Q is actually an aggregation of a public key P and a public key formed from the Merkle root of many other script types. Any of the alternative scripts in the Merkle tree can be used to spend the output.</p>
<p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/articles/taproot.png" alt="Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) allows users to send bitcoin to either a public key or multiple scripts of their choosing. This preserves privacy and space on the blockchain."></p>
<p>This design allows users to choose between complex, arbitrary scripts as well as simple pay-to-public-key functionality at the time of spending, rather than at the time of receiving. It also makes all Taproot outputs look similar. Because multisig outputs, single sig outputs, and other complex smart contracts all look the same on the blockchain, many chain analysis heuristics will become unusable, preserving privacy for all Taproot users.</p>
<h2 id="tapscript">Tapscript</h2>
<p>In order to implement P2TR transactions, BIP 342 adds and updates several <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/o/opcode/">opcodes</a>. These new scripts are used to verify Taproot spends and Schnorr signatures, and they are collectively known as Tapscript.</p>
<p>Tapscript was designed to maximize future flexibility of P2TR spending in order to allow for upgrades which are not yet foreseen.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-taproot">The Benefits of Taproot</h2>
<p>The Taproot upgrade offers many benefits to Bitcoin users who adopt Taproot as well as those who do not. The introduction of Schnorr signatures offers significant benefits to privacy and security, but Taproot and Tapscript also bring advantages of their own.</p>
<p>➤ <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-schnorr-signatures/#the-advantages-of-schnorr-signatures">Learn more about the benefits of Schnorr signatures.</a></p>

<h3 id="space-savings">Space Savings</h3>
<p>Most Taproot (P2TR) outputs consume less space on the blockchain than normal <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/p/p2pkh/">P2PKH</a> or <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/p/p2wpkh/">P2WPKH</a> outputs. This is mostly due to the fact that P2TR outputs lock bitcoin directly to a public key, not the hash of the public key. This makes sending to Taproot outputs slightly more expensive, because public keys take up more space than public key hashes. However, spending Taproot outputs is significantly cheaper because the public key is included in the scriptPubKey, and thus does not need to be included in the <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/s/script-witness/">ScriptWitness</a>.</p>
<p>Taproot also defined the encoding scheme for Schnorr public keys and signatures, making them shorter than their ECDSA counterparts, providing additional fee savings.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-benefits">Privacy Benefits</h3>
<p>The privacy implications of Taproot are perhaps the most important part of the upgrade. By introducing Schnorr signatures and key aggregation, multisignature contracts no longer look different from single signature contracts, providing privacy to all Taproot users.</p>
<div>

  

  
  <p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/icons/lightbulb.svg" alt="Key Fact: Since the Lightning Network relies on 2-of-2 multisig, Taproot makes it impossible to discern which transactions create Lightning channels."></p><p>
    Since the Lightning Network relies on 2-of-2 multisig, Taproot makes it impossible to discern which transactions create Lightning channels.
  </p>
  
</div>
<p>Taproot also introduces significant privacy benefits through the integration of MAST. As discussed above, Taproot allows bitcoin to be locked to many scripts at once. However, when spending bitcoin from a Taproot output, the spender need not reveal every possible script that could have unlocked the bitcoin; only the script which they actually used. In the majority of cases, Taproot users will likely use the pay-to-public-key option, allowing them to keep any backup options they might have planned private.</p>
<h3 id="security-upgrades">Security Upgrades</h3>
<p>On a technical, theoretical level, Schnorr signatures are considered more secure than ECDSA signatures because Schnorr signatures are provably secure using fewer assumptions. Like all elliptic curve cryptography schemes, both ECDSA and Schnorr rely on the assumption that the Discrete Logarithm Problem is hard. However, ECDSA relies on additional assumptions in order to guarantee its security. Nonetheless, there have been no examples of ECDSA being systematically compromised during Bitcoin’s existence.</p>
<p>Schnorr signatures also eliminate any signature <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/malleability/">malleability</a> that might have been present in ECDSA signatures. While transaction malleability was solved by the SegWit upgrade, malleability of signatures persisted as a feature of ECDSA.</p>
<h2 id="taproot-activation">Taproot Activation</h2>
<p>As of now, Taproot is still a proposed upgrade, and has not yet been activated on the Bitcoin network. When an upgrade to Bitcoin is proposed, it is first discussed by the developer community. Once the proposal is formalized, it is assigned a BIP number. After the code is written, reviewed, tested, and merged, Bitcoin node operators must decide how and when to activate the upgrade.</p>
<p>The Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript upgrades were given BIP 340, 341, and 342 in January of 2020, and have been under discussion and development since. In late 2020, the code implementation for all three upgrades was completed, tested, reviewed, and merged to Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, all of the necessary code exists to implement Taproot on an up-to-date Bitcoin node. Now, the community must decide on whether and how to activate Taproot and start enforcing the new consensus rules. There are several methods for activating upgrades to Bitcoin, so the community must first select a path and then execute it.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-activation-paths">Bitcoin Activation Paths</h3>
<p>BIP 8 and BIP 9 define two popular methods for activating upgrades. Both processes begin by surveying Bitcoin miners for support. If an overwhelming majority of miners signal their support through messages in the blocks they mine, the upgrade is activated. The difference between BIP 8 and BIP 9 arises if miner support is insufficient. In that case, BIP 9 specifies that the upgrade should not take place, while BIP 8 specifies that the upgrade should be activated after a delay period.</p>
<p>Variants of these two proposals have been put forward in the context of Taproot activation. However, the Bitcoin community has overwhelmingly supported Taproot, and very little criticism has been raised. Thus, the specific activation path is likely insignificant.</p>

But did you know he was once a political cartoonist? Historian Richard Minear guides us through the complexities of that history. He's the author of the book, Dr. Seuss Goes to War.</p><div><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4557946.1597425750!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dr-seuss-cbc-books.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Dr Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, sits at his drafting table in his home office in La Jolla, Calif., on April 25, 1957.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(Gene Lester/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Historian uncovers Dr. Seuss's complicated history as a political cartoonist"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/431/907/Day6_640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Day 6</span><span>9:09</span><span>Historian uncovers Dr. Seuss's complicated history as a political cartoonist</span></p></div></div></div></span></p><p><span><p>Richard Minear was worried when he first met Audrey Geisel.</p>  <p>It was 2001, and the historian and author was about to give a presentation on Geisel's late husband Theodor Seuss Geisel — better known as the beloved children's author and illustrator Dr. Seuss, who would have celebrated his 116th birthday this week.</p>  <p>It was two years after the release of his book <em>Dr. Seuss Goes to War</em>, which detailed his lesser-known career as a political cartoonist, who tackled issues such as racism, antisemitism and Adolf Hitler.</p>  <p>"I&nbsp;was a little bit concerned going in," Minear said. "She showed up and sat in the front row, and I didn't pull my punches in the presentation."</p>  <p>Geisel approached Minear after the presentation. She said it was "fascinating" and admitted that she had no idea about her late husband's past.</p>  <p>"For her in 2001 not to know about this aspect of Seuss startled me,"&nbsp;he told <em>Day 6</em> host Brent Bambury.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4957370.1545494203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/obit-audrey-geisel.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4957370.1545494203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/obit-audrey-geisel.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4957370.1545494203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/obit-audrey-geisel.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4957370.1545494203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/obit-audrey-geisel.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4957370.1545494203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/obit-audrey-geisel.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4957370.1545494203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/obit-audrey-geisel.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Audrey Geisel was the widow of famed children's book author Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss.

"That wasn't common among mainstream American newspapers ...&nbsp;so that's a major bright point of his legacy."</p>    <p>Seuss&nbsp;was also critical of non-interventionists, including the America First Committee, a non-partisan pressure group who opposed intervening in the war.&nbsp;</p>  <p>One of his&nbsp;most famous political cartoons depicts a mother reading a book about Adolf the Wolf, an obvious satire of Hitler.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487284.1583437840!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/and-the-wolf-chewed-up-the-children-and-spit-out-their-bones-but-those-were-foreign-children.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487284.1583437840!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/and-the-wolf-chewed-up-the-children-and-spit-out-their-bones-but-those-were-foreign-children.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487284.1583437840!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/and-the-wolf-chewed-up-the-children-and-spit-out-their-bones-but-those-were-foreign-children.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487284.1583437840!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/and-the-wolf-chewed-up-the-children-and-spit-out-their-bones-but-those-were-foreign-children.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487284.1583437840!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/and-the-wolf-chewed-up-the-children-and-spit-out-their-bones-but-those-were-foreign-children.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487284.1583437840!/fileImage/httpImage/and-the-wolf-chewed-up-the-children-and-spit-out-their-bones-but-those-were-foreign-children.jpg"></p></div><figcaption> ... and the wolf chewed up the children and spit out their bones... but those were foreign children and it really didn't matter., October 1, 1941, Dr. Seuss Political Cartoons.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Special Collections &amp; Archives, UC San Diego)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Minear also pointed to Seuss's sympathetic view of black Americans with one image dated 1942.</p>  <p>"He has one cartoon of a U.S. War Industry building, surrounded by a maze," he said.&nbsp;"And if you enter the door, there's no way you can get to&nbsp;the factory.

Those cartoons are racism barely concealed."</p>  <p>He described one specific cartoon&nbsp;published days before the internment of Japanese Americans in February 1942.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"He had one cartoon that showed Japanese Americans — or his stereotypical Japanese —&nbsp;on the west coast ... marching down toward a bungalow,"&nbsp;he said.</p>  <p>"The guy in front of the bungalow is handing out bricks of TNT, and there's a fellow on the roof with a spyglass pointed across the Pacific."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487316.1583438588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/waiting-for-the-signal-from-home.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487316.1583438588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/waiting-for-the-signal-from-home.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487316.1583438588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/waiting-for-the-signal-from-home.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487316.1583438588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/waiting-for-the-signal-from-home.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487316.1583438588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/waiting-for-the-signal-from-home.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487316.1583438588!/fileImage/httpImage/waiting-for-the-signal-from-home.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Waiting for the signal from home..., February 13, 1942, Dr. Seuss Political Cartoons.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Special Collection &amp; Archives, UC San Diego Library)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Minear suggested that Seuss likely had "very little contact, if any with&nbsp;Japanese or Japanese Americans," which might explain their portrayal.</p>  <p>"These cartoons certainly demonstrate that ignorance," he said.</p>  <p>Nonetheless, Minear says these "racist depictions" are a teachable moment.</p>  <p>"Even Dr. Seuss —&nbsp;liberal and good on anti-black sentiment, good on antisemitism —&nbsp;even this guy was totally blind about the Asian side of the picture," he said.</p>  <h2>Impact on his post-war works</h2>  <p>Not long after publishing his final political cartoon in January 1943, Seuss joined the United States Army. With the rank of captain, he commanded&nbsp;the Animation Department of the Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit.</p>  <p>There, he&nbsp;wrote propaganda and military training films including&nbsp;<em>Design for Death, </em>which won an Academy Award,<em>&nbsp;</em>and the animated&nbsp;<em>Private Snafu&nbsp;</em>series, which starred Mel Blanc.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/It3Bgm59mT0" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Seuss's political themes also stretched into his post-war children's books. Minear points out the clear references to Japan in&nbsp;<em>Horton Hears a Who,&nbsp;</em>which was published after Seuss&nbsp;visited Japan in 1953.</p>  <p>"[The passage] 'A person's a person no matter how small'" was "clearly a reference to Japan," he explained.</p>  <p>"And, there's a [vulture]&nbsp;named Vlad Vladikoff [who represents]&nbsp;the Russians, and&nbsp;their monkeys, presumably representing Red China."</p>  <p>He also mentions&nbsp;Yertle the Turtle,&nbsp;who initially "had a Hitler moustache," and the Sneetches from&nbsp;<em>The Sneetches and Other Stories</em>, who are a commentary on antisemitism due to the stars on some of their bellies.</p>  <p>Seuss included these themes in his books because he believed that children's literature was an extension of satire.</p>  <p>"Children's literature as I write it and as I see it is satire to a great extent – satirizing the mores and the habits of the world," <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190301-the-surprisingly-radical-politics-of-dr-seuss">he said.</a></p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by Mouhamad Rachini.&nbsp;To hear more from Richard Minear,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/current-affairs-information/day-6/" target="_blank">download our podcast</a>&nbsp;or click Listen above.</em></p>  <p><em>You can access all of Dr. Seuss's political cartoons by&nbsp;visiting <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dswenttowar/index.html#intro">UC San Diego's Special Collections &amp; Archives website</a>.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been about 5500 years since the wheel, one of the most genuine engineering wonders, was invented. The paper is about 2200 years old. The electricity is about 140, transistors reflect 100 years. Only 60 years have passed since the years when software engineering in its own form was known as engineering. Computer scientist and engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)" target="_blank">Margaret Hamilton</a> used the term “Software Engineering” for the first time while building navigation systems for Apollo missions. First master’s degree program in computer engineering at Seattle University took place in 1979 and the ADA Programming Language first appeared in 1980. The Rochester Institute of Technology opened its first bachelor’s degree programme in software development in 1996. The IEEE version of <a href="https://cs.fit.edu/~kgallagher/Schtick/Serious/SWEBOKv3.pdf" target="_blank">“Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)”</a> was published in the same year, 1996.</p><p>When compared to other engineering branches of human culture, computer engineering is a very young discipline. Yet, in history, no other engineering division has evolved so rapidly including the subjects it affected. Engineering devices like sonar, magnetic navigation, photoreceptors have benefited positively from this discipline. The predictability of the world of the other branches was what distinguished software engineering from other engineering branches. Software engineering continued to evolve as a discipline that has to be applied to a world where the laws of physics have changed weekly.</p><p>The only resource I had for the integration of a security dongle for a distribution business was the dongle manufacturer’s user manual at my desk and an email address to contact them when needed. It was a great experience for me to develop this application, because I would be able to transfer this knowledge that I have learned to my colleagues, or to share with other engineers that need it. And that information was of great importance. But now, the platforms like Google and StackOverflow etc simplified things with copy and paste which we do a lot. Now we don’t need to explicitly code algorithms that include calculus, trigonometry, and differential equations. We ought to be more relaxed, maybe. We couldn’t relax, though. Because the challenges faced by current software engineers have become more complicated and demands have risen for an average software engineer. They need to know the topics such as “Cross Platform”, “Asynchronous method”, “Security”, “DevOps”, “Distributed Systems”, “Asynchronous Process”, “Data Processing”, “Microservice Architectures”, “Domain Driven Development”, “Reactive Programming”, “Test Driven Development”, “Test/Data-intensive Development Environments”, “Containers”, “Orchestration Tools” and even more. Products can now be built to be open to millions, not as before, to a small number of consumers. An engineer who has no knowledge of TCP/IP literally writes a back-end service that runs on the Microservice Architecture on a DevOps-supported project without being aware of the cloud systems, is now a market-wide non-preferred engineer. They can save the day, but it won’t take long.</p><p>Years ago, I recall when using Kylix in an ERP development team for a company, I wrote an updater to get the final version of the executable file for the client from the internal network each time the application is started. It was so unusual and exceptional even for an engineer to be online all the time. The offline use of software and offline individuals are extraordinary and exceptional today.</p><p>Developing a new programming language, having knowledge about PL paradigms, writing a compiler or an interpreter were very idealist and romantic endeavours. The people who did these were the heroes of the academic world and they were the people of distinction. However, now, this situation can sometimes even be a weekend hobby of a young developer. There are dozens of new programming languages coming to the market every year, and some have set themselves up for learning a new programming language every year. Things are changing constantly, often unpredictably.</p><p>Each computer engineer has his/her own reason to choose this career. Some have made this decision according to the blowing wind, others have lost themselves in the magic of computers from a very young age, and some have believed they were just going to earn some money or status. There are also those who choose this career, either with the pressure or encouragement from their families, or temptation to choose the most difficult departments of college to join.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you have taken steps in this engineering discipline in some way, and you want to make yourself someone people always want to cooperate with, you have to be aware that it is critical to react quickly to uncertainty. And I strongly believe that you have to feel the pressure first in order to succeed.</p><p>In order to remain valuable in the industry for a long time, without compromising, it is important to aim at grasping certain engineering concepts. Here are some highlights that changed and not changed from these engineering notions which can make you important today:</p><h4 id="things-that-changed">Things that changed</h4><hr><h5 id="time-optimisation">Time Optimisation</h5><p>The paradigms are evolving so rapidly. Improving your ability to recognise what one needs to be specialised in is important. For example, recognising that knowledge of distributed VCS systems is now a must, and being competent and adequate about it, but determining if Git is the instrument that is supposed to be chosen “today”. I put “Time Optimisation” at the beginning of the list, because distinguishing important from unimportant and deciding how to spend your time are the most significant skills in the industry today. It’s a remarkable subject to be able to operate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> effectively.</p><h5 id="deep-focus">Deep Focus</h5><p>It takes deep work and focus to be able to see a complicated system or a story in terms of simple parts or to make them simple. As technology progresses, anyone who does not develop this skill will probably be left behind. Staying in deep focus amongst distractions like mobile notifications, funny YouTube videos and WhatsApp messages, will be the one of the most distinguishing soft skills in the years to come.</p><h5 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h5><p>Although experience is even more relevant at times when access to information was difficult, now, at t=0, an engineer can reach any technological or architectural information easily. Just because some developers have stored this historical information (or a boutique knowledge) in a custom knowledge hierarchy, companies do not have to bear their bad personalities. Software engineers with zero social skills are going extinct. Engineers, who are cocky and whose communication skills are not developed, are not preferred by companies regardless of their technical level.</p><h5 id="knowledge-of-upcoming-technologies">Knowledge of upcoming technologies</h5><p>I’m talking about the people who try and put aside new technology/libraries/tools and move on. Trying <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/736475" target="_blank">Alpha Preview/CTP/Beta</a> and the latest technologies you see coming up, libraries, tools, devices and reading some articles/manuals makes you much more efficient, desirable, searched and valuable now compared to the old days.</p><h4 id="things-that-didnt-changed">Things that didn’t changed</h4><hr><h5 id="continuous-and-fast-learning">Continuous and Fast Learning</h5><p>Challenges are very volatile and something new can come up at any time, unpredictably. Learning about something often implies expense, so it’s better to move early in order to break through the learning curve. Remember: “The more you know, the more advantages and differences you get.” Don’t say “I’ll learn it when the time comes.” It is imperative to attend conferences, monitor hot topics in universities, to join the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEE</a> and/or <a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a>, to become active and to expand the information network. It is necessary to review papers and be active in local organisations. There are engineers who instinctively do it right. But being able to express the theoretical context is also important.</p><p>In every software engineer’s reading list, these books should also be included:</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670" target="_blank">Code Complete</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612/" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/0134757599/" target="_blank">Refactoring</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113" target="_blank">Peopleware</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/" target="_blank">Mythical Man Month</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science/dp/3030542556" target="_blank">Algorithm Design Manual</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Pearls-Joe-Bentley/dp/8177588583" target="_blank">Programming Pearls</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0262510871/" target="_blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></p><h5 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h5><p>It is also a challenge to go to the root cause and behind the scenes to grasp languages, libraries and paradigms.

To understand this, the individual must first understand the history and evolution of Javascript, how DOM works, and how DOM manipulation makes sense and why it is so common.

With each new product release, the comment sections of articles and youtube videos are filled with negative remarks. Yet, carmakers are totally committed to the race of creating ever-bigger screens. If public opinion is so against touch interfaces in cars, why do car companies use them? I dove into this topic and confirmed my hypothesis: touch screens are not the problem per se, but car companies' design execution is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Touch screens in cars are not new. In fact, the first production car fitted with a touch screen was the 1986 Buick Riviera.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CRT touch display was not that bad, but it took some decades before touch screens were good enough to be widely adopted in cars. After Tesla launched the Model S with its 17" touch screen, carmakers have been eager to design increasingly bigger touch screens. Today, it is an exception if a car is not fitted with one. There are many reasons why this is happening. To dive into those, we first have to define the different types of interactions that occur while driving and how they evolved over time.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Classifying the Interactions</h2>
<p>Aside from the essential driving controls, like steering and braking, I split the interactions into three groups.
The first set is the primary interactions. They include all the functions that are directly related to driving and safety. Examples are monitoring the speed, turning on the indicators, and operating the windscreen wipers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secondary interactions are actions that occur frequently but take little time to accomplish. These can be changing the music volume, changing cabin temperature, or turning on the airconditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tertiary interactions are the opposite of the secondary ones. They are infrequent but require a high cognitive load and take longer to accomplish. Examples are filling in a destination in the navigation system or changing personal settings in the car.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of the Interactions</h2>
<p>Over time, these sets of interactions have evolved in mostly the same way. The interior of the Volkswagen Golf is an excellent demonstrator. The first generation Volkswagen Golf has a simple interior. The primary actions are limited to two gauges, some buttons, and a stalk for the indicators. The same goes for the secondary settings, consisting of three sliders to control the temperature and some volume controls. The only tertiary interaction is to find and set a radio channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, you can clearly see the impact of innovation on the interactions. With each generation, more features are added to the interior.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">

</video> 
<p>All three sets of interactions increase in quantity, even the primary ones. In the Golf, for example, instead of some basic gauges and controls, the latest generation's primary interactions now also include adaptive cruise control, speed limit warnings, and a range of other safety systems. Even something as simple as turning on the windscreen wipers or lights has increased in complexity with different modes, sensors, and settings.&nbsp;</p>

  </figure>
<p>Similarly, the secondary controls include countless different ways to set the right cabin temperature. There are buttons for heated seats and windows, airconditioning, individual climate control, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the real visible change is an exponential increase in tertiary interactions. Whereas in the first generation Golf, you can only choose a radio station, today there is an endless list of radio channels, streaming services, and podcast platforms. And that is just the media. Almost all cars come with navigation systems, phone connections, and internet-connected apps. All of these can be set up and configured to fit your personal taste. For example, you can choose the exact color of the interior lights, how heavy the steering should be, and which information should be shown in the cluster display.</p>
<p>Initially, all these interactions were controlled via indirect, physical controls. But over time, with each generation, the display grows in size, and the number of physical controls decreases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest generation Golf is another important step because even the secondary interactions are not moved to the touch interface. Most of the physical buttons that remain are the ones that are legally required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2001, BMW launched iDrive, one of the first in-vehicle infotainment systems. It was designed around indirect interactions via a controller close to the gear lever. At the time, it was a good balance between available technology, cost, and usability.&nbsp;</p>

  </figure>
<p>Over time, just like most in-car infotainment systems, BMW adjusted iDrive for use with touch interaction as well. Why did they decide to include touch interaction in the later version?</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>A lot of it has to do with the increasing complexity of tertiary interactions. As the number of these interactions increases with each generation, indirect controls seem to perform worse than touch interaction, especially in two areas: task completion time and adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research has shown that tertiary tasks are performed significantly faster via touch interactions when compared to indirect controls <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Even compared to other possible interaction techniques like gesture interaction and voice interaction, touch interaction performs equal, if not better <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Naturally, task completion time is only one way to measure the success of an interaction model. Touch screens score differently when it comes to visual attention, lane deviation, reaction time, and others. Carmakers have to weigh the time it takes to complete the tasks versus the gravity of the distraction. In a lot of scenarios, touch interactions are the preferred method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second solid argument is the adoption rate of touch interfaces. Once drivers enter their cars, their focus is on driving and not on learning a new system. So one way to decrease driver distraction is to make the interaction as close to other familiar digital products as possible. As such, touch screens are preferred over indirect controls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>The next reason why car makers use touch screens has to do with decluttering. It is a term that is often heard in design departments. It means to reduce the visual overload or perceived complexity of the interior. Getting into a car and seeing a dashboard full of buttons gives a busy, overwhelming look. Instead, a calm-looking interior with few buttons has a positive impact on comfort and perceived quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, many customers relate a big touch screen to a technologically advanced car. As an interior designer, you don't want your car to be perceived as old-fashioned so fitting a giant screen shows your brand is futuristic.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Compared to a dashboard full of different buttons, knobs, and screens, a single touch screen is a much more straightforward part to design, spec, and maintain. Therefore, carmakers may prefer to fit a standardized touch screen instead of a range of custom buttons and knobs because of the development cost.&nbsp;
Another advantage is the possibility to modernize the interior of the car by updating the UI design. Digital design trends move much faster than interior design trends. Tesla has shown that updating the interface of the Model S helps to delay an expensive redesign or new model introduction because the car looks less outdated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Design-wise, the main arguments in favor of touch screens are task completion time and adoption. But there are plenty of ergonomic downsides.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>In mobile environments, like cars, the users' primary focus is on controlling the vehicle. So touch interfaces not only have to be usable and accessible, but they also have to ensure road safety. As discussed before, even though task completion time is the fastest with touch interaction, there are other driver distraction measures where touch interaction is not the preferred method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of those is visual attention. When interacting with a touch screen, drivers need to move their visual attention from the road to the screen to find the object they want to select. Furthermore, they have to coordinate their finger to that object without any tactile objects guiding it. With physical controls, much less visual attention is needed to perform the interaction, leading to less distraction <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.
What is the impact of this difference in visual attention between touch controls and indirect controls? Experiments have shown that reaction times are slower, and there is a higher variance in driving behavior like lane departure and maintaining speed <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are the lack of haptic feedback when selecting an object and the display's placement, which is a trade-off between readability and reachability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to consider that there is no perfect solution for an interaction model of tertiary interactions that is easy to operate and not distracting. Carmakers should choose the 'least bad' solution in this case and design around its shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When weighing the positives with the drawbacks of touch screens, they are the right solution for tertiary interactions in most cases if they are optimized for task completion time <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>. The problem, though, is that currently, few of the interfaces are. This has much to do with the design choices of car companies.</p>

    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>}</span><span> - </span><span>{</span><span>Status</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>).</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we open up a shell to manipulate them, we can easily create a <code>Book</code> with a given status choice:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>$</span> <span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>shell</span>  <span># with ipython installed
</span><span>...</span>

<p>The <code>choices</code> list constrains the value of <code>status</code> during <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/instances/#validating-objects">model validation</a> in Python:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span> <span>=</span> <span>Book</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>full_clean</span><span>()</span>
<span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

   <span>1220</span>
   <span>1221</span>         <span>if</span> <span>errors</span><span>:</span>
<span>-&gt;</span> <span>1222</span>             <span>raise</span> <span>ValidationError</span><span>(</span><span>errors</span><span>)</span>

<span>ValidationError</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>'status'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"Value 'republished' is not a valid choice."</span><span>]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is great for <code>ModelForm</code>s and other cases using validation.
Users can’t select invalid choices and get messaging about what’s wrong.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s still easy for us, as developers, to write this invalid data to the database:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Woops!</strong></p>

<p>It’s also possible to update <em>all</em> our instances to an invalid status in one line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>Book</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>=</span><span>'republished'</span><span>)</span>
<span>Out</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, what gives?
Why does Django let us declare the set of <code>choices</code> we want the field to take, but then let us easily circumvent that?</p>

<p>Well, Django’s model validation is designed mostly for forms.
It trusts that other code paths in your application “know what they’re doing.”</p>

<p>If we want to prevent this, the most general solution is to get the database itself to reject bad data.
Not only will this make your Django code more robust, but any other applications using the database will use the constraints too.</p>

<p>We can add such constraints using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/constraints/#checkconstraint"><code>CheckConstraint</code> class</a>, added in Django 2.2.
For our model, we need define and name a single filter <code>CheckConstraint</code>, in <code>Meta.constraints</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Book</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span>
        <span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span>
        <span>choices</span><span>=</span><span>Status</span><span>.</span><span>choices</span><span>,</span>
        <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>Status</span><span>.</span><span>UNPUBLISHED</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>}</span><span> - </span><span>{</span><span>Status</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>).</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>constraints</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CheckConstraint</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"%(app_label)s_%(class)s_status_valid"</span><span>,</span>
                <span>check</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Q</span><span>(</span><span>status__in</span><span>=</span><span>Status</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>),</span>
            <span>)</span>
        <span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>Q</code> object represents a single expression we’d pass into <code>Model.objects.filter()</code>.
Constraints can have any amount of logic on the fields in the current model.
This includes all kinds of lookups, comparisons between fields, and database functions.</p>

<p>Running <code>makemigrations</code>, we get a migration that looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>migrations</span><span>,</span> <span>models</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>

    <span>dependencies</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>(</span><span>"core"</span><span>,</span> <span>"0001_initial"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>

    <span>operations</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>AddConstraint</span><span>(</span>
            <span>model_name</span><span>=</span><span>"book"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>constraint</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CheckConstraint</span><span>(</span>
                <span>check</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Q</span><span>(</span><span>status__in</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>"UN"</span><span>,</span> <span>"PB"</span><span>]),</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"%(app_label)s_%(class)s_status_valid"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>),</span>
        <span>),</span>
    <span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we try to apply this while the database contains invalid data, it will fail:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>python manage.py migrate
<span>Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: core

  Applying core.0002_book_status_valid...Traceback (most recent call last):

    return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: CHECK constraint failed: status_valid</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we clean that data up manually and try again, it will pass:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>python manage.py migrate
<span>Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: core
Running migrations:
  Applying core.0002_book_status_valid... OK</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>From that point on, the database won’t allow us to insert invalid rows, or update the valid rows to be invalid:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>()</span>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>Currently Django doesn’t have a way of showing these <code>IntegrityError</code>s to users in model validation.
Nothing will catch and turn them into <code>ValidationError</code>s which can carry user-facing messages.
As per the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general constraints are not checked during <code>full_clean()</code>, and do not raise <code>ValidationError</code>s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30581">open ticket #30581</a> to improve this.</p>

<p>In our case, since we are still using <code>choices</code>, this is okay.
Validation already won’t allow users to select invalid statuses.</p>

<p>For more complex constraints, we might want to duplicate the logic in Python with a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/">custom validator</a>.</p>

<p>Check constraints are really neat.
Having the data constrained at the lowest level possible gives us the strongest guarantees of its quality.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps you consider using them,</p>

              <p>Dr. Laurent Michel is a FusionAuth community member and product owner at Softozor. He chatted with us over email about how he and his team are using FusionAuth to meet their auth needs.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Tell me a bit about your work as a developer, software architect and product owner as well as what softozor does.</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Softozor is a very little company made up by me, my brother and a few friends. Currently, we work together in our free time. We are mostly physicists and mathematicians. My brother and I work in software development companies. Our friends are teachers. One of the goals of the Softozor company is to produce educational video games. In order to achieve that goal, we need money, which we are trying to earn with software development projects. Currently, we are developing an ecommerce platform helping craftsmen to sell their products and make them visible in the regions they are living in. A craftsman can be a farmer, a caterer, a baker, a butcher, etc.</p>

<p>I am the company’s official leader. I energize the roles of developer, architect, and product owner. I am the only one team member with the product owner role. The roles of developer and architect are taken by other members of the team. Every architectural decision is discussed in the team so that we get as much insight as possible into the possible problems that we might face during the development. This way we also spread the knowledge of everyone across the whole team.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I essentially develop in C++, C# (.Net / WPF), javascript (VueJs), and python (mainly to write acceptance tests).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ease of installation and the set of features were the most decisive motivations to use [FusionAuth].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Is the craftsman site live? Can you share the URL?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Yes, the <a href="https://www.ameising.ch/">craftsman site is live</a>, in a reduced form. In the near future, it will show our customers all the shops we are managing. Currently, no shop is shown yet but they will soon pop on the map that we see on the homepage. The platform is not a traditional e-shop. It manages multiple e-shops where each e-shop has multiple tenants. What you see today is just kind of our crowd-funding: we sell baskets of vegetables, fruits, bread, etc. Also, the project you see on that URL targets Switzerland.</p>

<p>The codebase we’ve come up with, however, will be used to produce other e-shopping solutions, not necessarily located in Switzerland.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you use FusionAuth? OAuth? User management? Social sign-on? Something else?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> The development of our platform is proceeding slowly. We integrated FusionAuth last year to the platform’s admin panel. It is planned to be integrated to the e-shop as well, but that is not a priority. We use FusionAuth for user management. It produces JWTs for us which are then consumed by our hasura API. It is very important to us that FusionAuth provides permission management features. Also JWT lambdas are critical for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] documentation is outstanding…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you use the lambdas? Is it to inject custom permissions (admin, seller, buyer) or for some other use?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  In order to be able to issue requests to our hasura API, it is sometimes necessary to have a JWT. JWTs that are compatible with hasura need special data containing the user’s allowed roles and id, among other things. Here’s a sample populate function that we use in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>populate</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>registration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>jwt</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>https://hasura.io/jwt/claims</span><span>'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-allowed-roles</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-default-role</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-user-id</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In our software, JWTs are used on the admin frontend, where the craftsmen can define their inventory, shop managers can monitor sellings, etc. On the shop itself, we are not using JWTs yet, because we aren’t supporting customer accounts yet, which would be the only use case where JWTs would be useful. Indeed, the whole shopping frontend is generated following the JAMStack philosophy. Therefore, the sensitive information is gathered from the hasura API with special rights on our CI/CD server and injected into the shop frontend whenever necessary. That leaves users of that frontend with (almost) no way to hack into our API.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> What problems did we solve for you? And how were you solving them before FusionAuth?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> You solve the permission management problem. You provide us with a reliable way to generate JWTs that are compatible with hasura. It’s the first time where we had to integrate an authorization and authentication system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both [the .NET and python SDKs] saved us a lot of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Why did you choose FusionAuth over the competition?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> We evaluated a few options: keycloak, keratin/authn, and FusionAuth. The ease of installation and the set of features were the most decisive motivations to use your software. Its documentation is outstanding, and that also helped a lot in choosing FusionAuth.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How much time and money would you say FusionAuth has saved you?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> It saved a lot of time. If we agree that time is money, then it saved us a lot of money too. We could’ve implemented a reduced set of the features provided by FusionAuth, but that would’ve taken a lot of time. We could’ve chosen another solution other than FusionAuth and implemented the missing features, but again that would’ve been a killer. I’d say it saved us something like one man-year of time.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you run FusionAuth (k8s, standalone tomcat server, behind a proxy, etc)?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> We run FusionAuth on a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. It is completely hidden behind our hasura api. We write hasura actions that interact with FusionAuth.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Can you tell me a bit more about the hasura actions?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Our system is based on the 3-factor app pattern: realtime graphql API, reliable eventing, and async serverless. That is out-of-the-box hasura behavior.</p>

<p>When relevant data is changed in our database, some events are triggered, which results in calling some serverless functions (e.g. in our system we use OpenFaaS). In addition to that, we can complete the GraphQL API automatically generated by hasura with additional queries / mutations, which are known as “hasura actions”. For example, the automatically generated API does not come out with a login mutation. Either you route the login request from your frontend to FusionAuth directly or you decide that you have a central API over which everything should go.</p>

<p>We chose the latter variant, as we find it both clearer and cleaner. In that case, we had to define a hasura login action. That amounts to telling hasura what the mutation looks like: what name, what input, what output, and then link that mutation with a serverless function. In that context, we are very happy to use the .Net SDK provided by FusionAuth! It has all the necessary REST client wrappers necessary for us to perform the operations we need on FusionAuth.</p>

<p>We are also very happy to use the python SDK in our acceptance tests. We use it to fill up the users database with the necessary credentials to then interact with our system under test.</p>

<p>Both SDKs saved us a lot of time.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Any general feedback/areas to improve?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  I think it would be great if FusionAuth could produce <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/paseto">Pasetos</a>. I know everyone on the web uses JWTs, but those are very easy to handle in an insecure way. They are insecure by default, whereas Pasetos are secure by default. <em>[Ed note: We have an open feature request for <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/773">paseto support</a>.]</em></p>

<p>For our use-cases with hasura, it would not bring anything right now (see <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/3205">this issue</a>) but I can imagine that they could be useful in the near future.</p>

                <h3>Git in 10 commands to do 99% of gitting and keeping out of trouble</h3>
                
            </p>

            <p>Git is hard, probably harder than it needs to be but I have been using it for about 5 years and have a workflow that works for me. I use git from a command line and have learnt how to use these ten commands. If I need to deal with a merge conflict, I use VS Code and the gitlens extension. If I need to do anything else then I probably copy out the files I want to keep, reset my local repo or delete it and clone a new repo then paste back the files I want to include in the change.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-new-piece-of-work">Starting a new piece of work</h2>
<p>This requires creating a new branch. We want to checkout master, make sure it is up to date and then create a new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre>
<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_branch_name
</code></pre><p>Now, if the checkout or the pull fail then I will likely do a git stash to throw away any local changes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash --include-untracked
</code></pre><p>If I still can't pull from master it is probably because I have commits that I don't want on the remote master. I will probably clone a new version of the repo:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf repo (or mv repo oldrepo)
</code></pre><p>then</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://url
</code></pre><p>then I will create the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_branch_name
</code></pre><h2 id="committing-work">Committing Work</h2>
<p>I have done my work and want to commit it, either to then push to the remote repo or to add more work later on.</p>
<pre><code>git add .
</code></pre><p>I very rarely want to only add a subset of files, if I do then I will put the full path to the file to add:</p>
<pre><code>git add ./folder/folder/folder/file.ext
</code></pre><p>Once I have added the files I will check what state I am in:</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre><p>What I am looking for is a) I have remembered to checkout a branch and am not working on master and b) that I have got the files ready to commit that I expect.</p>
<p>If I forgot to create a branch, then I will stash everything, checkout the new branch then pop the changes into the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git stash --include-untracked
git pull
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git stash pop
</code></pre><p>&nbsp;
I realise you could just do a <code>git checkout -b</code> but I like to keep it simple and keep my branch up to date.</p>
<p>If I have the correct files in my list of staged files then I will commit the files:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "message"
</code></pre><p>If there are files that I don't want to check it, maybe I fat fingered a change to a file I didn't want I will either fix it up manually or checkout the original version of the file:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -- ./folder/folder/folder/file.ext
</code></pre><p>and then I will commit the files I do want.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-my-changes">Sharing my changes</h2>
<p>When I am ready to push my changes to the remote repo, I do a git push:</p>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre><p>This always fails the first time I run it but the output shows the command I do need to run. I copy and paste that output and push my changes.</p>
<h2 id="red-green">Red Green</h2>
<p>From here, if I need to make any changes I go and do that, add the files, commit that changes and push them until I am done. If there have been changes on master I don't have then I will bring them locally:</p>
<pre><code>git pull origin master
</code></pre><p>origin is the name of the remote, if you aren't sure what it is do:</p>
<pre><code>git remote --v
</code></pre><p>If you get a merge conflict then open the directory in VS Code. Make sure you have gitlens installed as an extension in VS Code and then use the file explorer to find the files that are a bluey colour. When you have found the files with a conflict, open them and browse to the sections with the conflicts and VS Code will let you either keep the incoming change (the changes already on master), keep your local changes (the changes you just made) or keep both. VS Code does a pretty good job of merging the files.</p>
<p>Once you have fixed the merges then go back to add, commit, push.</p>
<h2 id="finish">Finish</h2>
<p>Lastly checkout master and pull down the latest changes:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre><p>Then check for any branches that can be deleted and get rid of them. <code>git branch</code> shows all the local branches:</p>
<pre><code>git branch
</code></pre><p>If you no longer need a branch then:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D branch_name
</code></pre><p>and shazam, the branches gone. You are now back at master, ready to start the merry-go-round again.</p>
<p>If you read this, scoffed and went “oh you could have done it like x” well great, I am sure there are loads of efficiencies to make here but this works for me so I am happy with my git choices.</p>
<h3 id="more-help">More Help</h3>
<p>For help with specific scenarios: <a href="https://dangitgit.com/en">https://dangitgit.com/en</a></p>
<p>(and the ten commands to stop you having to count and proove me wrong):</p>
<ul>
<li>git pull</li>
<li>git checkout</li>
<li>git stash</li>
<li>git add</li>
<li>git commit</li>
<li>git branch</li>
<li>git push</li>
<li>git clone</li>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git remote</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Thousands of years ago one of your ancient ancestors was enjoying the spoils of a recent hunting trip when suddenly a saber toothed tiger jumped out of the bush. &nbsp;Your cave man relative had a choice, fight off the tiger or drop the food and run. &nbsp;They ran….and they ran fast. &nbsp;The human brain is an amazing thing, it has evolved over the eons to help us survive. &nbsp;Most of those eons involved surviving physical threats where flight over fight was often the smart choice.</p>
<p>The financial “threats” we face in the 21st century are diametrically opposed to the physical threats of ancient times. &nbsp;Stock market crashes, unlike hungry saber toothed tigers, often present opportunities as opposed to imminent death. &nbsp;My very simple example here downplays the complex neurobiology of the human brain that drives us to make poor financial decisions, but the end result is the same:&nbsp; humans are hardwired to be poor investors.</p>

<h2>Brief Review of Financial Neurobiology</h2>
<p>In addition to “fight or flight”, there are a host of other <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rflr.v3.n1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented and studied cognitive psychological human tendencies</a> that impede our ability to be rational investors.&nbsp; Here is a high level list provided by the CFA Institute.</p>
<p>•Overconfidence and overoptimism—investors overestimate their ability and the accuracy of the information they have.</p>
<p>• Representativeness—investors assess situations based on superficial characteristics rather than underlying probabilities.</p>
<p>• Conservatism—forecasters cling to prior beliefs in the face of new information.</p>
<p>• Availability bias—investors overstate the probabilities of recently observed or experienced events because the memory is fresh.</p>
<p>• Frame dependence and anchoring—the form of presentation of information can affect the decision made.</p>
<p>• Mental accounting—individuals allocate wealth to separate mental compartments and ignore fungibility and correlation effects.</p>
<p>• Regret aversion—individuals make decisions in a way that allows them to avoid feeling emotional pain in the event of an adverse outcome.</p>
<h2>What is a Pea-brained Human to do?</h2>
<p>I am by no means an expert on all of the ways our brains fail us with our finances.&nbsp; My opinion is that some people are wired well for today’s financial world, these lucky ones are winners of Warren Buffett’s “Ovarian Lottery.”&nbsp; Unfortunately, I believe the vast majority of us are vulnerable to these behavioral traps.&nbsp; But there is hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as species go we as humans are uniquely gifted with intelligence and logic, two tools that we at engineered portfolio believe you can use to combat your cave man brain and become a successful investor.&nbsp; Becoming a successful investor, like most things in life, requires thoughtful planning and hard work.&nbsp; The below suggestions work in tandem with one another, reinforcing each other, you need them all to have a proper mind set to tackle Mr. Market.&nbsp; For those of you who don’t know Mr. Market go read, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507565929&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Intelligent Investor</a>” by Benjamin Graham RIGHT NOW!</p>
<h3>Understand History</h3>
<p>When faced with a major market correction how do you feel?&nbsp; As the panic sets in what are the thoughts going through your brain?&nbsp; What should be going through your brain is that this is normal stock market behavior and you know this because you have studied the history of the stock market!&nbsp; To date, the stock market has always recovered from every down turn, every depression and every panic.&nbsp; Sometimes it rebounds quickly, sometimes it takes decades to come back.&nbsp; But it always has come back.&nbsp; If we are the unlucky generation to see our stock markets completely crumble and be worthless it probably means we are in the midst of some kind of zombie apocalypse so you have bigger things to worry about than your portfolio.&nbsp; In fact your cave man brain might actually be more useful to you in this scenario!</p>
<p>I am not saying blindly buy and hold stocks and white knuckle your way through the ups and downs.&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; But understanding the stock market history will help you both build, adjust and stick to your plan.</p>
<p>Here is some basic history but I strongly urge you to read as much about stock market history as possible to arm yourself with the data you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/1287761-how-often-does-s-and-p-500-have-10-percent-and-20-percent-negative-price-moves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The stock market has 10% and 20% corrections VERY often</a>.
<ul>
<li>In the last 30 years 10% corrections have occurred an average of 2.27 times per year</li>
<li>In the last 30 years 20% corrections have occurred an average of 0.73 times per year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stocks can be extremely over valued (optimism) or undervalued (pessimism) and prices tend to revert to a “mean”</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended Reading:</p>
<p>William J. Bernstein’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio/dp/0071747052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519584544&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=four+pillars+of+investing">The Four Pillars of Investing</a>“.&nbsp; Pillar #2 is the history of investing.&nbsp; It is only about 20 pages, however I recommend reading the entire book.</p>
<p>Benjamin Graham’s ” The Intelligent Investor.”&nbsp; Chapter 3 covers a century of stock market history (up to 1972).&nbsp; I really enjoy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519585168&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+intelligent+investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Zweig’s offering</a> which has Mr. Graham’s original text alongside some more modern commentary.&nbsp; It really shows the durability of Graham’s teachings.</p>
<h3>Look FORWARD to a Market Crash…..WHAT?!</h3>
<p>I should add a note to that title, look forward to <strong>AND BE PREPARED FOR</strong> a market crash.&nbsp; This might seem a little crazy, but this is the mindset you should have, you want to flip fear on its head.&nbsp; If you are a current purchaser of stocks and if you believe that in the end, the price level of the market ends up where ever it is going to end up, it is generally better for you if stock prices are lower today.&nbsp; This plays into knowing your history.&nbsp; In order to buy into a falling market you have to have confidence that the market will rebound.&nbsp; Also, in order to buy into a market you need money!&nbsp; When you have un-invested cash and you are armed with historical knowledge you start to look forward to when you can deploy that cash….you can’t wait for the market to drop!</p>
<p>I have two pieces of advice here:</p>
<p>#1 – Always have at least 10% of your invest-able assets in non stock assets (bonds, cash, gold etc).&nbsp; Ideally you would have 10% cash ready to deploy in a downturn.&nbsp; You can’t take advantage of a downturn in stocks if you don’t have the resources.</p>
<p>#2 – WARNING:&nbsp; Some people will hate this advice.&nbsp; It is generally a good idea to always have 6 months expenses saved in cash.&nbsp; If you believe your job is safe I recommend putting up to 50% of your cash reserves into the market during a correction.&nbsp; I would recommend putting 20% in after a 10% correction, if the market continues to fall I would put another 30% in after a 20% correction.</p>
<h3>Automate Your Financial Life – Save!</h3>
<p>Whether it is paying bills or saving for retirement I highly recommend automating your financial life.&nbsp; At this point I spend less than 5 minutes a month paying bills or transferring money, it is all automated.&nbsp; Inertia, distraction, fear and sometimes just laziness can get in the way of making smart financial decisions.&nbsp; One of the smartest financial decisions you can make is to SAVE!&nbsp; Don’t tempt fate, automate your savings where you can.&nbsp; This is one of the big benefits of employer 401(k) plans, the money comes out of your paycheck without any work on your part.&nbsp; If you want to fund an IRA, set up an automatic monthly transfer from your checking account, it becomes mindless.&nbsp; I fund my taxable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> account with an automatic $100 transfer every week.&nbsp; If you don’t know what Robinhood is I strongly recommend you check it out as it plays into my next piece of advice, control what you can control.&nbsp; Fee’s are one of the biggest things you can control.</p>
<h3>Control What You Can Control – Fees</h3>
<p>I hate fees.&nbsp; This is a little off topic as far as behavioral finance is concerned, but I never want to miss an opportunity to say how much I hate fees!&nbsp; Any rational and logical person should want to reduce their financial fees as much as possible.&nbsp; You will reach your financial goals much sooner if you keep your fees low.&nbsp; Please have a read on the corrosive nature of investment fees in <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/03/11/the-corrosive-nature-of-investment-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another blog I wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; For a taxable stock account check out <a href="https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a>, no costs to buy or sell!</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; When buying mutual funds or ETFs never pay more than 0.30%, ideally pay 0.10% or less.&nbsp; I find <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/mutual-funds/asset-class/month-end-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a> consistently offers low cost funds.</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; If your 401(k) plan only has high fee options, get some fellow concerned co-workers together and petition your human resources department to make improvements.&nbsp; They are fiduciaries for you and should be very receptive to your concerns about high fees.</p>
<h3>Control What You Can Control – Asset Allocation</h3>
<p>Again, this plays into understanding history.&nbsp; Asset allocation is the “mix” of different types of investments you hold.&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar with asset allocation I suggest you check out this <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/2016/08/01/asset-allocation-and-the-efficient_frontier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>.&nbsp; A proper asset allocation can help behaviorally on a number of fronts.&nbsp; First, a good asset allocation should minimize risk for a given level of return.&nbsp; The less risk you need to take the less likely you are to succumb to your cave man brain.&nbsp; Second, like understanding the market history, understanding the benefits of a good asset allocation will give you confidence and resolve through market turmoil.&nbsp; My partner Steve has done some amazing work on this website on really smart and unique asset allocation.&nbsp; Asset allocation is what an engineered portfolio is all about!</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; Read all of <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve’s blogs</a>.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered portfolios</a> that Steve built.</p>
<h3>Unique Advice – Check Your Accounts at Least Weekly, Ideally Daily</h3>
<p>This is financial blasphemy to many.&nbsp; The current thinking in the world is that since you have these behavioral weaknesses you should compensate for them by avoiding your finances.&nbsp; The thinking is that you will do something stupid if you look at them.&nbsp; I don’t disagree…..assuming that you look at them infrequently and if you only look at them when the financial world seems to be falling apart.&nbsp; This is exactly what happens.&nbsp; People are going through their lives:&nbsp; family, work, friends, vacations etc.&nbsp; They don’t really pay much attention to Wall Street or their investments.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden there is a major …</p></div></div>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

The home is 1900 square feet and took only forty eight hours of print time, over an eight day period. The home was entirely printed and built onsite using less than $6000 in materials. Future print-time is expected to be cut in half on their next projects, due to ARCS enhancements implemented post construction.</p>
<p>ARCS is a patent pending technology that robotically builds foundations, exterior walls, interior walls, utility conduits and more. This digital driven system reduces labor to as little as 3 people, accounting for up to 41% of the total construction of a home. ARCS low-power consumption technology allows homes and buildings to be built using far less energy than needed in traditional construction methods, creating an environmentally friendly impact.</p>
<p>ARCS achieves faster build times by eliminating and consolidating over 20 manual labor intensive processes (siding, framing, sheathing, etc.). This revolutionary technology will be replacing and eliminating more expensive and inferior building materials, causing the printed structures to be stronger and safer. Utilizing concrete will reduce the cost by at least 30%, as well as making the structure more fire resistant than traditional methods. This home will have the strength to last into the next century.</p>
<p>SQ4D’s completion of the world’s largest 3D printed home is a game changer. “Changing the way the world is built” is more than just the company’s tagline; it is a reality.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-zyrianov-8a7ab34/">Sergey Zyrianov</a> - Tech Lead, 2021-02-28</p>
<p>A timer is a cornerstone of any software that communicates over the network. There are plenty of implementations
that provide a timer facility. Most of them are in memory and will lose scheduled timers should the application crash.
In this blog we discuss durable Kafka timers that do not depend on in memory state. By design
we shall assume 1 second resolution of these timers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Before taking on timers let’s cover some Kafka basics.</p>

<h2 id="kafka-concepts">Kafka concepts</h2>
<p>There are a few Kafka concepts in play to simulate timers - Kafka topic, Kafka stream, Kafka streams library.
Where <em>topic</em> is append only log of events, <em>stream</em> is a cache of N most recent events on the <em>topic</em>, 
and the <em>streams library</em> is a software library implementing the concept of the <em>stream</em>.</p>

<p>A kafka topic resides inside the Kafka servers, but Kafka streams library keeps track of a topic’s most recent
events on the application side - the stream. The stream is a key/value cache with random read access unlike
append only topic log. Key/value cache is not the only thing the library provides. It can also join
the streams. When an event and its key appear on a stream, the library looks up the same key in the other streams participating in the join. 
It is using key/value cache associated with each stream and gives the result to the application. 
The result will have the present event enriched with the matched past events from the joined streams.
Joining two streams will yield the timer callback. Let’s see how.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Since it is Kafka, timer expiration shall result in an event posted on a topic of user’s choice at the right time.
This event is delayed until due time by joining two streams: <em>oscillator</em> and <em>timer-request</em>. Callback 
event is pushed to <em>timer-request</em> topic with key equal to the expiration timestamp. Oscillator topic
is the clock dial counting seconds since UNIX epoch in real time. At some point it will get to the second
which is equal to the key on <em>timer-request</em> topic, and the join will come up with the callback event.</p>

<p>An excellent summary on “timer wheel” and other timer algorithms can be found in this linux kernel <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/156329/">thread</a>.
Our implementation of timers using Kafka resembles the “timer wheel” algorithm with a bucket on each second to keep callbacks.
<em>Oscillator</em> topic models rotating clock dial, <em>timer-request</em> is bucketing callbacks by the expiration timestamp, and join of these two
contains content of the expired bucket with all the callbacks in it.</p>

<p><img src="https://wgtwo.com/img/blog/kafka-timers/kt.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There are two Kafka applications running together to service these topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oscillator</li>
  <li>Futures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="oscillator">Oscillator</h3>

<p>With the resolution of 1 second oscillator keeps pushing <em>oscillator</em> topic:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>nowSeconds</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>currentTimeMillis</span><span>()</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000L</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>timestampSeconds</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>nowSeconds</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>timestampSeconds</span><span>++</span>
        <span>KafkaProducers</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span>
            <span>"oscillator"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>timestampSeconds</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"1"</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="futures">Futures</h3>

<p>When requesting a timer by pushing <em>timer-request</em> topic, the user provides a callback structure 
used to dispatch timer event:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>message Future {
    string callBackTopic = 1;
    string callBackKey = 2;
    bytes callBack = 3;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Joining two streams on the key equal to the UNIX second will give all expired timers, and
their callback coordinates.</p>

<p>First, setup a join with <em>WINDOW_SIZE</em> large enough to cover the longest timer duration</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>oscillator</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.</span><span>stream</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>"oscillator"</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="cancelling-a-timer">Cancelling a timer</h3>
<p>There is no way to cancel these timers as events can’t be easily removed from the Kafka stream.
Still, it is possible to ignore timer events by using a token in callback request, and a variable 
in timer receiver state. When scheduling a timer the receiver puts the same token in two places:</p>

<ul>
  <li>callback struct it publishes on the <em>timer-request</em> topic</li>
  <li>internal variable timerToken</li>
</ul>

<p>As timer fires receiver compares value in timerToken and in the callback event. Based on the result it
draws a conclusion if timer is to be ignored or not. All it has to do to cancel a timer is to reset
value in its timerToken variable.</p>

<p>Since normally Kafka does “at least once” delivery it is a good idea to reset the timerToken immediately 
after notification event.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-worry-about">What to worry about</h3>

<p>Kafka streams library is using local disk storage to keep the cache. The storage shall be large enough to host
all timer requests based on the product of <em>timer-request</em> topic retention, callback size and timer scheduling rate.
Thankfully Kafka is well-equipped to deal with this sort of troubles.</p>

<p>Oscillator must keep ticking otherwise timers will stop coming. Make sure to have
metrics/alarms in place to stay on top of Oscillator health. Deploy few of them for redundancy having in 
mind the extra load they will generate on timer users.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many options to export application state to the data tier layer. Timers are often part of that
state. Above we showed how to apply Kafka primitives to achieve a goal of making application “stateless” even
if the state is using timers. It has its costs and benefits.</p>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code. If you want to learn more in detail about the underlying technology, we recommend you to read our blog post <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing?hsLang=en"><span>The Magic Behind Feedback-based Fuzzing.</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote><p>One luminary clock against the sky <br> Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p><p><cite>Robert Frost, <em>Acquainted with the Night</em> (1928)</cite></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Time is still the great mystery to us. It is no more than a&nbsp;concept; we don’t know if it even exists…</p><p><cite>Clifford D. Simak, <em>Shake­speare’s Planet</em> (1976)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Time is money, or so the saying goes. It follows that money is also time: a&nbsp;repre­sen­ta­tion of the collec­tive economic energy stored by humanity. However, the link between time and money is more intri­cate than it might seem at first. If money requires no time to create, it doesn’t work as money very well, or not for long. More profoundly, as we shall see, keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm always implies keeping track of time.</p><p>As soon as money goes digital, we have to agree on a&nbsp;<em>defin­i­tion of time</em>, and herein lies the whole problem. You might think telling the time is as easy as glancing at whatever clock is nearby, and you would be right when it comes to everyday tasks. But when it comes to synchro­nizing the state of a&nbsp;global, adver­sarial, distrib­uted network, telling the time becomes an almost intractable problem. How do you tell the time if clocks can’t be trusted? How do you create the concept of a&nbsp;singular time if your system spans the galaxy? How do you measure time in a&nbsp;timeless realm? And what is time anyway?&nbsp;</p><p>To answer these questions, we will have to take a&nbsp;closer look at the concept of time itself and how Bitcoin makes up its own time: block time — more commonly known as <em>block height</em>. We will explore why the problem of timekeeping is intimately related to keeping records, why there is no absolute time in a&nbsp;decen­tral­ized system, and how Bitcoin uses causality and unpre­dictability to build its own sense of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: “The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age.” Today, it is again a&nbsp;timekeeping device that is trans­forming our civiliza­tion: a&nbsp;clock, not computers, is the true key-machine of the modern infor­ma­tional age. And this clock is Bitcoin.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-of-things">Keeping Track of Things</h2><blockquote><p>Let the child learn to count things, thus getting the notion of number. These things are, for the purpose of counting, consid­ered alike, and they may be single objects or groups.</p><p><cite>David Eugene Smith, <em>The Teaching of Elemen­tary Mathe­matics</em> (1900)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to keep track of things: physical tokens and ledgers. You can either use real-world artifacts directly, e.g., give someone a&nbsp;sea shell, a&nbsp;coin, or some other tangible <em>thing</em>, or you can repli­cate the state of the world by writing down what happened on a&nbsp;piece of paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you are a&nbsp;shepherd and want to make sure that your whole flock returned home. You can put a&nbsp;collar on each sheep, and as soon as a&nbsp;sheep returns home, you simply remove the collar and hang it up in your shed. If you have one hanger for every collar, you will know that every sheep returned safely as soon as all hangers are filled. Of course, you can also count them and keep a&nbsp;list. However, you will have to make sure to create a&nbsp;new list every time you start counting, and you will also have to make sure not to count a&nbsp;single sheep twice (or not at all).</p><p>Money is essen­tially a&nbsp;tool to keep track of who owes what to whom. Broadly speaking, every­thing we have used as money up to now falls into two categories: <em>physical</em> artifacts and <em>infor­ma­tional</em> lists. Or, to use more common parlance: tokens and ledgers.</p><figure> <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2021-01-14-bitcoin-is-time/ledger-token.jpg"></figure><p>It is impor­tant to realize the inherent differ­ence of these categories, so let me point it out explic­itly: The first method — a&nbsp;physical token — <em>directly</em> repre­sents the state of things. The second one — a&nbsp;ledger — <em>indirectly</em> reflects the state of things. Each comes with advan­tages and disad­van­tages. For example, tokens are physical and distrib­uted; ledgers are infor­ma­tional and central­ized. Tokens are inher­ently trust­less; ledgers are not.</p><p>In the digital realm — no matter how intensely marketing gurus try to convince you of the opposite — we can only use ledgers. It is an <em>infor­ma­tional</em> realm, not a&nbsp;physical one. Even if you call a&nbsp;certain kind of infor­ma­tion a “token,” it is still a&nbsp;malleable piece of infor­ma­tion, written down on a&nbsp;hard drive or some other medium that can hold infor­ma­tion, effec­tively rendering it an infor­ma­tional record.</p><p>The ledger-like nature of all digital infor­ma­tion is the root cause of the double-spend problem. Infor­ma­tion never repre­sents the state of the world <em>directly</em>. Further, the movement of infor­ma­tion implies copying. Infor­ma­tion exists in one place, and to “move” it, you have to copy it to another place and erase it at its origin. This problem doesn’t exist in the physical realm. In the physical realm, we can actually move things from A&nbsp;to B. The infor­ma­tional realm doesn’t have this property. If you want to “move” infor­ma­tion from list A&nbsp;to list B, you have to copy it from A&nbsp;to B. There is no other way.</p><p>Another way to think about it is in terms of unique­ness. Physical tokens are unique compos­ites of atoms whose assembly is not easily replic­able. Pure infor­ma­tion does not have this property. If you can read the infor­ma­tion, you can also copy it perfectly. Practi­cally speaking, it follows that physical tokens are unique, and digital tokens are not. I&nbsp;would even argue that “digital token” is a&nbsp;misnomer. A&nbsp;token might repre­sent secret infor­ma­tion, but it will never repre­sent unique, singular, uncopy­able infor­ma­tion.</p><p>This differ­ence in proper­ties shows that there really is no way to “hand over” infor­ma­tion. It is impos­sible to pass on a&nbsp;digital token like you would pass on a&nbsp;physical one since you can never be sure if the original owner destroyed the infor­ma­tion on his end. Digital tokens, like all infor­ma­tion, can only be spread, like an idea.</p><blockquote><p>… if you have an apple and I&nbsp;have an apple, and we swap apples — we each end up with only one apple. But if you and I&nbsp;have an idea and we swap ideas — we each end up with two ideas.</p><p><cite>Charles F. Brannan (1949)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Physical tokens — what we call physical bearer assets, or “cash” — are free from this dilemma. In the real world, if you hand me a&nbsp;coin, your coin is gone. There is no magical dupli­ca­tion of the coin, and the only way to give it to me is to physi­cally hand it over. The laws of physics do not allow you to double-spend it.</p><p>While double-spending does exist in the non-digital realm — George Parker, a&nbsp;con artist who famously “double-spent” the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks comes to mind — it requires elabo­rate decep­tion and gullible buyers. Not so in the digital realm.&nbsp;</p><p>In the digital realm, because we are always dealing with <em>infor­ma­tion,</em> double-spending is an <em>inherent</em> problem. As everyone who ever copied a&nbsp;file or used copy-and-paste knows, infor­ma­tion is something that you can copy <em>perfectly</em>, and it is not bound to the medium that hosts it. If you have a&nbsp;digital photo­graph, for example, you can copy it a&nbsp;million times, store some copies on a&nbsp;USB stick, and send it to thousands of different people. Perfect copies are possible because infor­ma­tion allows for flawless error correc­tion, which elimi­nates degra­da­tion. And to top things off, there is virtu­ally no cost to dupli­ca­tion and no way to tell what the original was.</p><p>Again: when it comes to infor­ma­tion, copying is all there is. There simply is no way to <em>move</em> digital infor­ma­tion from A&nbsp;to B. Infor­ma­tion is always <em>copied</em> from A&nbsp;to B, and if the copying process was successful, the original copy of A&nbsp;is deleted. This is why the double-spending problem is so tricky. Absent of a&nbsp;central authority, there is no way to move <em>anything</em> from A&nbsp;to B&nbsp;in a&nbsp;trust­less manner. You always have to trust that the original will be deleted. A&nbsp;natural side-effect is that, when it comes to digital infor­ma­tion, it is <em>impos­sible</em> to tell how many copies are in existence and where these copies might be.</p><p>Because of this, using digital “tokens” as money can not and will never work. Since tokens derive their relia­bility from being hard to repro­duce as a&nbsp;result of their unique physical construc­tion, this advan­tage disap­pears in the digital realm. In the digital realm, tokens cannot be trusted. As a&nbsp;result of the nature of infor­ma­tion’s intrinsic proper­ties, the only viable format for digital money is not a&nbsp;token but a&nbsp;ledger — which brings us to the problem of time.</p><h2 id="tokens-are-timeless-ledgers-are-not">Tokens Are Timeless, Ledgers Are Not</h2><blockquote><p>For the things seen are tempo­rary, but the things unseen are everlasting.</p><p><cite>Paul of Tarsus, <em>Corinthians</em> 4:18b</cite></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to physical tokens, the time of a&nbsp;trans­ac­tion does not matter. You either have the coins in your pocket, or you don’t; you can either spend them, or you can’t. The simple act of posses­sion is the only prereq­ui­site for spending. The laws of nature take care of the rest. In that sense, physical tokens are trust­less and timeless.</p><p>When it comes to ledgers, physical posses­sion falls to the wayside. Whoever is in control of the ledger needs to make sure that things are <em>in order</em>. What is other­wise given by physical laws, namely that you can’t spend money that you don’t have and you can’t spend money that you have already spent previ­ously, has to be enforced by man-made rules. It is these rules that govern the orderly opera­tion and mainte­nance of a&nbsp;ledger, not physical laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving from physical laws to man-made rules is the crux of the matter. Man-made rules can be bent and broken, physical laws not so much. For example, you can’t simply “make up” a&nbsp;physical gold coin. You have to dig it out of the ground. You can, however, absolutely make up a&nbsp;gold coin on paper. To do this, you simply add an entry to the ledger and give yourself a&nbsp;couple of coins. Or, in the case of central banks, simply add a&nbsp;couple trillion with a&nbsp;few computer keystrokes. (Fancy finan­cial people call this “Rehypoth­e­ca­tion,” “Fractional Reserve Banking,” or …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Networking is a requirement for most modern iOS apps.</p>
<p>Networked apps usually interface with a remote web service that provides data. And often, such a web service is a REST API that returns data in JSON format.</p>
<p>Writing the networking layer of an iOS app, though, is not a simple task. When making asynchronous network calls, you need to combine several features of Swift, SwiftUI, and the Foundation framework. Moreover, many parts of your app’s architecture need to interact, making the task more complicated than it might seem at first.</p>

<p>It’s easy to say: <i>“I need to get some data from a REST API</i>.” But such sentence hides a ton of complexity. Many developers simply put together pieces of networking code they find on Stack Overflow, o use a networking library.</p>
<p>But networking has a lot of hidden pitfalls.</p>
<p>I once worked on a project where strange bugs happened randomly. The app displayed a list of items, and the user could add more. But sometimes, when adding a new item, the app would reply with an alert saying that the object already existed on the server. Since that was a new item, it clearly was not possible. And the problem was even weirder. The alert would not only show once but multiple times.</p>
<p>After a more in-depth investigation, I discovered that the problem was caused by the networking stack of the app, which had the wrong architecture. Network calls and callbacks were handled through notifications, which I usually recommend to avoid. Since there were many listeners for the same notification, network calls for the same item were duplicated. The server then rejected the extra network calls, causing the multiple alerts to appear in the app.</p>
<p>Architecture is a topic I often cover in my articles because this is the vital foundation of every iOS app. Even if you use the iOS SDK correctly <b>if you structure your code in the wrong way you end with all sorts of problems in your app</b>.</p>

<p>Performing network requests in a real SwiftUI app</p>
</div>

<h2>The required steps to perform network requests to a REST API from an iOS app</h2>
<p>Performing network requests in an iOS app does not merely amount to adding some extra code. There are many moving parts you need to understand when connecting to a remote web service in iOS. In this article, we will look at each aspect, one by one.</p>
<p>In summary, these are the steps you need to go through to perform a network request in an iOS app:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand how the remote web service works</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, there are <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many public APIs</a> on the internet. Each one comes with its implementation and documentation. And, if you work for a company or a client, you might have to interface with a private one. Modern web services often, but not always, are based on the <i>REST architecture</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand how the HTTP protocol works.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>REST APIs are based on the <i>HTTP protocol</i>, which is the communication protocol used by the world wide web. Understanding HTTP means knowing how <i>URLs </i>are structured, what actions you can express using <i>HTTP methods</i>, how you can express <i>parameters</i> in a request, and how to send or receive<i> </i>data.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Get a list of all the URLs to make the requests you need</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every REST API offers a series of URLs to fetch, create, update, and delete data on a server. These are unique to each API. Their structure depends on the choices made by the developers that created the API. If you are lucky,&nbsp;your API of choice&nbsp;<span>comes with proper documentation. Often though, especially when you interface with a private API, you have to talk to the server-side developers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Learn how to use the URL loading system in the iOS SDK</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation">The Foundation framework</a> has a robust networking API that addresses all your networking needs, especially for the HTTP protocol. The workhorse of this API is the <i>URLSession</i> class. On the internet, you can also find alternative networking libraries, which I don’t recommend using.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Perform a network request to get the data you need in your app.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>By putting together the elements I listed above, you can write the code to perform a remote API call and get back some data. Data comes in different formats, like binary data (for media files), JSON, XML, Markdown, HTML, or others.</p>
<p>Before you can use such data in your app, you have to parse it and convert to your model types. Binary data is usually directly convertible into the appropriate media types you find in the iOS SDK. In the case of structured data like JSON, parsing is also quite straightforward. For more complex formats like XML, Markdown, and HTML you might have to write a custom parser.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Handle the asynchronous nature of network calls in Swift.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If making network requests alone was not already hard enough, you have to add to it the fact that you need to run network requests <i>asynchronously</i>.</p>
<p>Network requests are inherently slow since it takes time for a server to respond and to transfer data over the network. That means that networking code needs to run in the background, or your app will become unresponsive for long periods. This has different implications in how you write your Swift code, how you handle callbacks, and how you manage memory.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Finally, use the retrieved data in your app</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also not as straightforward as it sounds. Network requests can fail for many reasons, so you need to handle errors and missing data. You also need to update the UI of your app and show to the user that data is being fetched over the network.</p>
<h2>REST APIs use URLs and the HTTP protocol to identify resources and transfer data</h2>
<p>You access any REST API through the internet. That means that the various resources offered by the API are identified by a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uniform resource locators or URLs</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png" alt="the parts composing a URL" width="1251" height="272" srcset="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png 1251w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-300x65.png 300w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-768x167.png 768w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-1024x223.png 1024w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-624x136.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px" data-srcset="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png 1251w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-300x65.png 300w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-768x167.png 768w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-1024x223.png 1024w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-624x136.png 624w" data-src="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p>A URL has different components, but in the context of REST APIs, we are usually interested in just three:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The host</b>, which is typically a name (or sometimes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a>) that identifies the other endpoint (the <i>server</i>) we are going to connect to.</li>
<li><b>A path</b>, which identifies the resource we are looking for.</li>
<li><b>An optional query</b>, where we can add extra parameters to affect the data we get back (filtering, sorting, paging, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>URLs though, are just a part of what you need to understand to communicate with a REST API. The other part is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representational State Transfer architecture or REST</a>.</p>
<p>REST is a type of architecture for web services. But as iOS developers, <b>we don’t care how the entire REST architecture works</b> on the side of the server. All we care about is what we see from an iOS app.</p>
<h2>Making REST API calls using HTTP requests</h2>
<p>REST works over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>, which was created to transmit web pages over the internet. Simply put, in HTTP, we send requests to a server, which sends back responses.</p>
<p>An <i>HTTP request</i> usually contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a URL</b> identifying the resource we want;</li>
<li><b>an HTTP method</b> that states the action we want to perform;</li>
<li><b>optional parameters</b> for the server in the form of HTTP headers;</li>
<li><b>some optional data</b> we might want to send to the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most REST APIs use only a subset of HTTP methods to express which actions you can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd19220564784"><span><span>GET</span></span></span>, to fetch a resource</li>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd1d655209491"><span><span>POST</span></span></span>, to create or update a resource</li>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd20188128503"><span><span>DELETE</span></span></span>, to delete a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>Some APIs can also use the 
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd22813155340"><span><span>HEAD</span></span></span>, 
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd25328100235"><span><span>PUT</span></span></span> or 
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd27994895470"><span><span>PATCH</span></span></span> methods, although it depends on the skills of the API developer. How these work depends on the specific API you are using, so you always have to check the documentation to see if they are available and what they do.</p>
<p>When it comes to parameters, you might have noticed we have two options: either the query string in the URL or the HTTP headers.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So which one should you use?</p>
<p>Details usually depend on the API, but, in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>The query string is for parameters related to the resource you are accessing.</li>
<li>The HTTP headers are for parameters related to the request itself, for example, authentication headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in the optional data section of a request, we put the data we want to send to the API when we are creating or modifying a resource. If you are simply fetching a resource, you don’t need to add any data to your request. In fact, the HTTP specification states that a server can reject a 
			<span id="crayon-6042939f3bd2b380098953"><span><span>GET</span></span></span> request that contains data.</p>
<h2>Most REST APIs return structured JSON and binary data</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, in HTTP, you make requests, and the server replies with responses. An HTTP response usually carries:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a status code</b>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a number</a> that tells you if your call was ok or if there was some error;</li>
<li><b>some HTTP headers</b> specifying extra information about the response;</li>
<li><b>data</b>, if you requested some.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are many formats a REST API can use, most APIs return data in the <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</a> format. JSON is a data format made to be lightweight, easy for humans to read, and easy for machines to generate and parse.</p>
<p>Some web services, though, might use other formats. Common formats are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XML</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a>. If you interact with a Windows server, you might receive data in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOAP</a> format, which requires you to write a custom parser, since it’s based on XML.</p>
<p>When communicating with remote APIs, we don’t only receive structured data. It is common to receive media files like images or videos, which are transmitted as pure binary data.</p>
<p>Beware though that binary data does not come along with the initial response, to keep the latter lightweight. What you get are URLs in the JSON data usually pointing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content delivery network</a>. …</p></div></div>

However, it's one of the most confusing Hooks (at least in my experience). But if you spend some time to learn how it works, you'll see that it's actually a hidden gem 💎, a powerful tool in your arsenal.</p><p>I'll reveal this shiny gem <span>💎</span> for you in four steps:</p><ol><li>What is it used for?</li><li>The mental model</li><li>A couple of contrived examples (but they are really helpful for learning)</li><li>A couple of real-world examples</li></ol><p>This article assumes that you are familiar with React basics, as well as how to use the <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks.</p><h2><a id="what-is-useref-used-for" href="#what-is-useref-used-for"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>What is useRef used for?</a></h2><p>There are two use cases.</p><h3><a id="directly-access-dom-nodes" href="#directly-access-dom-nodes"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Directly access DOM nodes</a></h3><p>When combined with the <code>ref</code> attribute, we could use <code>useRef</code> to obtain the underlying DOM nodes to perform DOM operations imperatively. In fact, this is really an escape hatch. We should only do this sparsely for things that React doesn't provide a declarative API for, such as focus management. If we use it for everything (in theory we could), we'd lose the benefit of <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/what-is-react#declarative-ui">React's declarative programming paradigm</a>.</p><h3><a id="persist-a-value-across-rerenders" href="#persist-a-value-across-rerenders"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Persist a value across rerenders</a></h3><p>This is what I'm going to focus on in this article.

And it clicked! If you are hearing the same clicking sound in your mind right now already, feel free to skip to <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/react-useref-by-example#example-1-previous-value--state">the examples section</a>. Otherwise, if you are not familiar with JavaScript classes or class instance variables, read on. This section is for you.</p><h3><a id="the-rerendering-time-loop" href="#the-rerendering-time-loop"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The "rerendering time loop"</a></h3><p>To understand how <code>useRef</code> works and why we need it, let's get started with a contrived (but useful) example. Can you build a counter without using the <code>useState</code> hook?</p><p>Let's give it a try:</p><p>This doesn't work, even though the value of <code>count</code> increases on click. Why? React is oblivious to the change of local variables and, therefore, doesn't know when to update the DOM. We'd need to rerender the component, namely request React to call the component function <code>Counter</code>, to let the change reflected on the screen.</p><p>You can verify this by uncommenting the line <code>console.log('render')</code> right after <code>let count = 0</code>. The component isn't rendered when the user clicks the button.</p><p>OK. Then what if we force the component to render when <code>count</code> updates?</p><p>This doesn't work either. The count displayed on the page stays zero. Even worse, the count value in the console stopped working too. It's always <code>0</code>!</p><p>BTW, <code>useForceRender</code> above is a custom hook:</p><p>Why? This is what I call <strong><em>rerendering time loop</em></strong>.</p><div><p><img alt="Time loop" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Every time when the component rerenders, it goes into a time loop. All the local variables in the function will be reset to their original values. That's why <code>count</code> is always <code>0</code>.</p><p>That's no surprise, right? They are local variables defined in the function. When the function reruns, the variables are supposed to behave like that!</p><p>As straighforward as this sounds, sometimes it's easy to forget (I do it all the time). So remember, since a React component is rerendered all the time, all the local variables will go into a time loop, over and over again.</p><div><p>Does this "rerendering time loop" metaphor make sense to you?</p></div><p>So, we need a solution that survives this "rerendering time loop". We want to preserve the value no matter how many times the component is rendered. If we update <code>count</code> to <code>42</code>, at the next render it should still be <code>42</code>, not the initial value <code>0</code>.</p><p>Let's try the first approach: what if we move the variable out of the component function? It will no longer be affected by the rerendering time loop, right?</p><p>That's correct! It works! Yay!</p><h3><a id="component-instances" href="#component-instances"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Component instances</a></h3><p>But wait a second, what if we want to have two counters?</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Click both buttons a few times: </p></div></div></div></div></div><p>So our counters are still broken. Did you try it in the preview window? The two counters are tied together. Clicking one button changes the other counter too!</p><p>That's because both counters are tied to the same variable <code>count</code>. What we need instead is to have a <strong><em>separate</em></strong> variable for each <strong><em>instance</em></strong> of the counter.</p><p>So the requirements are:</p><ol><li>Persist a value across rerenders</li><li>Persist the value per component instance, throughout the full lifetime of that instance</li></ol><p>Introducing <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>But, but we are still using that <code>useForceRender</code> to update the DOM! If we comment out <code>forceRender()</code>, the counter stops working again! (try it)</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it relies on <code>useState</code> to work properly? Why don't we just use <code>useState</code>?</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it doesn't trigger a rerender when the value is updated?</p><p>In fact, being able to persist a value across rerenders <em>without</em> triggering another rerender is exactly why <code>useRef</code> is created. Sometimes we just don't want the component to rerender when the value is updated.</p><p>It's now time to look at a better example.</p><h2><a id="example-1-previous-value--state" href="#example-1-previous-value--state"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 1: previous value / state</a></h2><p>Let's modify the Counter component. Now we want to display the previous value of the counter whenever the button is clicked. We can do so using a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, and of course <code>useRef</code>.</p><p>Look, when saving the previous state in <code>useEffect</code>, we definitely don't want the component to rerender. Otherwise, it'd go into an infinite loop. So, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue!</p><h2><a id="example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval" href="#example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)</a></h2><p>Now let's look at a more useful example. How about a stop watch?</p><p>We can make the stop watch tick with a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code> and <code>setInterval</code>:</p><p>But how do we pause the stop watch?</p><p>We can add another state <code>ticking</code> and clear the interval when <code>ticking</code> is <code>false</code>. Let's give it a try:</p><p>Did you see the problem? Where should we define that variable <code>interval</code>?</p><p>If we define <code>interval</code> in the outer scope, we'll taste the wrath of the rerendering time loop -- <code>interval</code> will always be <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>We don't want to put it in state either, since it's really not something we would want to display on the UI. It's interval stuff.</p><p>Again, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue:</p><p>You can check out a fully working <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-cancelable-interval-uljky?file=/src/App.js">CodeSandbox here</a>.</p><h2><a id="example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat" href="#example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 3: Press and hold to repeat</a></h2><p>Let's check out the real thing! Just a reminder, this is what we want to build (remember to click and hold):</p><p>We are going to focus on the press-and-hold behavior:</p><ol><li>When the mouse is down, wait a little bit;</li><li>If the mouse is still down after a threshold, say 500 milliseconds, start repeatedly increasing the like count at an interval until the mouse is up;</li></ol><p>How would we implement this behavior?</p><p>In order to detect the press-and-hold gesture, we can use <code>setTimeout</code>. When the mouse is down, kick off the timeout. When the mouse is up, clear the timeout.</p><p>How do we set and clear the timeout when the component is rendered and rerendered, i.e. when the state <code>mouseDown</code> changes?</p><p>You already know the answer from Example 2, right? <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>Next, how do we repeatedly increase the like count? <code>setInterval</code> is what we need. And of course we'll use another ref to keep track of the interval reference across rerenders.</p><p>Finally, we can extract all the logic into a custom Hook <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code>:</p><p>When using the <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code> hook, remember to use <code>useCallback</code> to prevent excess renders due to the fact the function might be recreated on each render (time loop).</p><p>Check out the full source code in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/likebutton-usepressholdrepeat-3b1qo">this CodeSandbox</a></p><p>Note: The animation in this example is implemented with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.framer.com/api/motion/">Framer Motion</a>.

	<p><span>Mon 01 March 2021</span></p><p>The <a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/risc-v-cpu-part-1.html">previous instalment</a> of this
series was "basically an explanation of what FPGAs are and a 'hello world'
nMigen example."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In this post, I will be detailing the design of my CPU as
it currently stands, and going over the various mistakes I made along the way.
As with the previous post, I am primarily aiming this at software engineers who
are new to hardware design – but I hope it will be interesting to anyone
interested in nMigen, RISC-V, or CPU design generally.</p>
<p>I hope the mistakes I made along the way will be a useful frame for considering
these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is fundamentally different from software
  design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is similar to software design?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for my CPU at the time of writing
<a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi/tree/33229b5fdcee90cfdf776ccf925f560f0fa5ce82">here</a>
or an up to date version <a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi">here</a>.</p>
<h2>An introduction to RISC-V</h2>
<p>RISC-V ("risk five") is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA).
"RISC" means "reduced instruction set computer", broadly meaning that the
ISA prioritises simple instructions. In contrast, CISC (complex instruction set
computer) ISAs are optimised to perform actions in as few instructions as
possible, hence their instructions are often more complex. ARM architectures
are RISC; x86-related architectures are CISC.</p>
<p>Usually in industry, ISAs are patented, so in order to implement the ISA you
need an (expensive) license from the vendor. Often, commercial ISAs are poorly
documented, with the motivation behind design details not always being
available even after such a license agreement.</p>
<p>From the RISC-V spec <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goals in defining RISC-V include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A completely <em>open</em> ISA that is freely available to academia and industry</li>
<li>a <em>real</em> ISA suitable for direct native hardware implementation, not just
simulation or binary translation.</li>
<li>An ISA that avoids "over-architecting" for a particular microarchitecture
style, but which allows efficient implementation in any of these.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a lot of commercial architectures are complex and burdened with
backwards-compatibility constraints. RISC-V offers a fresh start!</p>
<p>The ISA doesn't explain the details of how to design a CPU – it just
defines an abstract model of the CPU, mostly by defining what instructions the
CPU must support, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The encoding of the instructions (i.e. how to construct the machine code that
  the CPU will run)</li>
<li>The registers (the very fast, very small storage locations accessed directly
  by the CPU)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>How to actually create a CPU that realises these requirements is up to us \o/</p>
<h3>A quick note (feel free to skip if you don't have opinions about CPUs)</h3>
<p>I'm trying to design a single-stage CPU; that is, I'm trying to design a CPU
that retires one instruction per clock cycle with no pipelining.  Usually CPUs
have pipelining in place to maximise efficiency. I am hoping that avoiding this
will result in a simpler design more suitable to my learning. Perhaps it will
complicate other aspects of the design (like my program counter having 3
outputs), but I'm certainly finding it easier to hold the design in my
head when I only have to think about this clock cycle and the next. I will
likely discuss this in more detail in the next blog post where I implement the
load instructions. I have a plan for how to make these work in a single cycle,
but they do pose a particular challenge and I may change my design as a
consequence.</p>
<h2>Designing a CPU</h2>
<p>RISC-V defines various ISA modules; I will be implementing RV32I, the base
32-bit integer instruction set.</p>
<p>To design my CPU, I first looked at the JAL (jump and link) and the ADDI (add
immediate) instructions, and drew a block diagram of what hardware
would be needed to decode those instructions. I think the ADDI instruction is
easier to grasp if you're not used to thinking about how machine code is
encoded, so we'll start with that. If this all totally foreign to you, you
might enjoy my
<a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/how-to-flash-an-led.html">introduction to ARM assembly</a>.</p>
<h3>Decoding ADDI</h3>
<p><img alt="iri" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/integer-register-immediate.png" title="Diagram of instruction encoding for ADDI from RISC-V spec"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADDI adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to register <em>rs1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's break some of this down, imagining we're decoding such an instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immediate is analogous to a literal value in source code; the value itself
  is encoded in the instruction, rather than e.g. retrieved from a register.</li>
<li>The <em>opcode</em> field is the same value for all the instructions listed here. </li>
<li>Once we've read the <em>opcode</em>, we know that bits 12-14 contain the <em>funct3</em>
  field (3 for 3 bits), which encodes whether this is an ADDI instruction (or
  SLTI, ANDI &amp;c.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, somehow we will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the value stored in register <em>rs1</em><ul>
<li>Therefore, our register file needs an input for selecting this register
  to read, and an output for the data read from that register.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add that to the immediate value<ul>
<li>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) will be helpful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Store the result in register <em>rd</em><ul>
<li>Our register file also needs write select and write data inputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign-extension will be necessary too – this is just the process of
taking a number narrower than (in our case) 32 bits, and filling in the
remaining bits such that two's complement arithmetic will be performed
correctly. I won't include this in the diagram below.</p>
<p>Implicit in all this is that we'll need some way to retrieve the instruction
itself and pass it to the instruction decoder. The <em>program counter</em> is
what tells the instruction memory which address to retrieve an instruction
from.</p>
<p><img alt="addi" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/addi.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the ADDI instruction. The instruction         decoder tells the register file to read from rs1 and write to rd. The         data read from rs1 and the immediate are inputs to the ALU. The output         of the ALU is written to rd. The program counter tells the instruction         memory which address to retrieve and instruction from, and the         instruction memory provides that instruction to the instruction         decoder."></p>
<p>I'm using thick cyan lines for data flow and thin magenta lines for control
flow.</p>
<h3>JAL</h3>
<p>Now let's try doing the same for JAL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jump and link (JAL) instruction [...] immediate encodes a signed offset
in multiples of 2 bytes. The offset is sign-extended and added to the <code>pc</code> to
form the jump target address. [...] JAL stores the address of the instruction
following the jump (<code>pc</code> + 4) into register <em>rd</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more going on here, particularly if you aren't familiar with
machine code. We noted above that the program counter sets which instruction
will be executed next. Usually the program counter simply increments to the
next address each cycle – that's how we continue to execute our program!
However, say our program calls a subroutine stored elsewhere in memory; we'd
need a way to <em>jump</em> to the subroutine address. Or, say we wanted an infinite
loop (ubiquitous in embedded software!); we'd need a way to <em>jump</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> back to
the address at the start of the loop. JAL allows for these situations.</p>
<p>The "link" part of JAL is the part where the next instruction is stored in the
destination register. This is convenient when the jump is used to execute a
subroutine: once the subroutine completes, we can jump back to that stored
instruction address.</p>
<p>Here's the encoding for JAL:</p>
<p><img alt="jal-enc" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/jal-enc.png" title="Diagram of instruction encoding for JAL from RISC-V spec"></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The opcode uniquely defines the JAL instruction (no other instructions share
  this opcode)</li>
<li>We need to unshuffle the immediate to get the offset</li>
<li>The LSB<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> of the immediate is not encoded because it must be 0: only
  offsets in multiples of 2 bytes are supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The unshuffling caused me some pain in my code, so it's amusing to me that it
won't be part of the block diagram below. But it's part of the internals of the
instruction decoder, not its interface, which is what we are determining with
these diagrams. The shuffled bits might seem nonsensical, but they're chosen to
maximise overlap with other instruction formats in RISC-V.</p>
<p><img alt="jal" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/jal.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the JAL instruction."></p>
<h3>Putting ADDI and JAL together</h3>
<p>The next challenge is to draw a block diagram that implements both ADDI and
JAL. The first obvious problem: the inputs to the ALU are different in both
cases, as is the wiring of the output. We need some kind of logic block that
can pick between them depending on some control signal: a multiplexer (mux).</p>
<p>We also need a way to tell the program counter whether the next instruction
address should come from a set address or from incrementing the current
address.</p>
<p>Here's what my design looks like at the moment (excluding a few things I have
because I know I'll need them later, like two read select/data signals on the
register file):</p>
<p><img alt="mux" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/mux.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the JAL and ADDI instructions."></p>
<h2>Implementing the design</h2>
<p>As covered in my previous blog post, I'm using
<a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</a> to implement my design. As I'm
currently designing a single-stage CPU, more of my design is
combinatorial, rather than synchronous, because I don't require the additional
state that pipelining necessitates. This most likely means my design is
unable to run quickly, but that's not a concern of mine.</p>
<p>I don't think it's helpful to post all the source code of my implementation in
this blog, but I will include some code here to illustrate mistakes that I made
and what I learned from them.</p>
<h3>Mistake #1: thinking about my logic circuit sequentially</h3>
<p>I initially implemented my program counter incorrectly after I got really
confused about when synchronous updates would take effect. I initially only had
the <code>pc</code> and <code>pc_inc</code> outputs because I didn't really understand the difference
between <code>pc</code> and <code>pc_next</code>.  It's taken some getting used to thinking about the
whole logic circuit "happening at once"<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>, rather thinking sequentially like
I would when writing software.  This is what led to my confusion. Properly
conceptualising your circuit in this way is key, and a challenge if you're used
to writing software.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/daniel-bourke" target="_blank" rel="follow">Daniel here</a>, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="follow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. I also write regularly about machine learning and on my own blog as well as make videos on the topic on YouTube.</p>
<p>Welcome to the 14th edition of Machine Learning Monthly. A 500ish (+/-1000ish, usually +) word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found in the last month. </p>
<p>Since there's a lot going on, the utmost care has been taken to keep things to the point.</p>

<h3>The Zero To Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course has launched!</h3>
<p>During COVID lockdowns of 2020, I decided to brush up my TensorFlow skills by getting TensorFlow Developer Certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ya5NwvKafDk" target="_blank" rel="follow">I made a video about how I did it</a> (in a month or so) and afterwards had a bunch of questions from others asking how they could too.</p>
<p>The video talked about different resources I used but I wanted to go a step further.</p>
<p>So to answer the question of “I want to learn TensorFlow, where do I start?” I created the <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse" target="_blank" rel="follow">Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course</a>.</p>
<p>It teaches 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fundamentals of deep learning (a machine learning paradigm taking the world by storm)</li>
<li>The fundamentals of TensorFlow (a framework used to write deep learning algorithms, e.g. Neural Networks)</li>
<li>How to pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification (this is optional but requires 1 &amp; 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire course is code-first. Which means I use code to explain different concepts and link external non-code first resources for those who want to learn more.</p>
<p>I’m so pumped for this release, it’s the biggest thing I’ve ever worked on! I’d love if you checked it out: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/academy">Sign up on the Zero to Mastery Academy</a> to start taking the course now</li>
<li>Learn more about the topics and projects covered in the course <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse" target="_blank" rel="follow">here</a></li>
<li>View <a href="https://www.github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="follow">all of the course materials on GitHub</a> (more to come)</li>

</ul>
<h3>A Machine Learning Deployment Tutorial for 20% Software Engineers for Stanford’s CS329s</h3>
<p>I started learning machine learning in 2017 using Stanford lectures and tutorials. So when Chip Huyen (featured below) asked if I’d like to create and deliver one myself, I said yes.</p>
<p>My goal was to break down the barrier for machine learning model deployment by highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model deployment is like model building (except instead of stacking together layers, you stack together cloud services)</li>
<li>The holy grail of ML-powered applications: the data flywheel (introduced in <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/machine-learning-monthly-january-2021/">January 2021’s ML monthly</a>)</li>
<li>What do you do when (not if) your model fails?</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover this, during the tutorial we deploy a TensorFlow image classification model (spoiler: one of the model’s we build in the TensorFlow for Deep Learning course!) to Google Cloud and use it to power Food Vision (a Streamlit app which classifies different photos of food). Watch below and head here to <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/cs329s-ml-deployment-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="follow">see the code &amp; slides</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>From the ML community 🙋‍♀️</strong></h2>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08562" target="_blank" rel="follow">Using Deep Learning to Read Brainwaves</a></h3>
<p>Imagine being able to put on a helmet and instead of typing on a keyboard, all you do is think about what’d you like to type. And the sensors in the helmet pickup what you’re thinking and translate them to the screen. Well that’s what Muhtasham and team are working towards. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08562" target="_blank" rel="follow">Their latest paper</a> takes electroencephalogram (EEG) from a brain-computer interface (BCI) and passes them through a deep neural network to try and predict what key you’re thinking of pressing on a keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>I take being able to type for granted now. I learned when I was young playing online video games. But what if you couldn’t type? What if you didn’t have the ability to use your limbs or speak? How would you communicate in the digital world? Here’s where BCI’s come in. Instead of you physically performing an action, a BCI reads the electric signals in your brain and translates them to the physical world. This is one of the avenues Neuralink is heading down.</p>
<p>Sensational work Muhtasham and team, for those interested in reading how these systems work, read A Neural Network for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt/serving-tensorflow-models" target="_blank" rel="follow">Álvaro's guide to TensorFlow Serving</a></h3>
<p>Last time with how to turn your PyTorch models into an API, this time how to turn your TensorFlow models into an API using TensorFlow Serving.</p>
<p>In the machine learning model deployment tutorial above I used Google’s AI Platform to deploy a trained TensorFlow model. AI Platform runs TensorFlow Serving under the hood. So if you want to see how you could set up your own TensorFlow model API (so you can send data to it and receive predictions back), check out <a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt/serving-tensorflow-models" target="_blank" rel="follow">Álvaro's TensorFlow Serving tutorial on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>An aside, I really love this format of sharing your work. Right within GitHub. A great way to demonstrate skill on a certain topic, code and word explanations interlaced together.</p>
<h2><strong>From the interwebs 🕸</strong></h2>
<h3>Chip Huyen’s outstanding machine learning blog (2 recent posts)</h3>
<p>I’m a big fan of Chip’s work. Last year we saw her post on the MLOps (all the parts of a machine learning system around the model) tooling landscape. Now there’s a version 2 and an essay on machine learning going real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Post 1:</strong> <strong><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/30/mlops-v2.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">MLOps Tooling Landscape v2</a></strong></p>
<p>The takeaway from this post is that the ML tooling landscape is growing (and fast). </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Well it seems many of the development roadblocks for ML systems have been worked out and now solutions for those common roadblocks are being built.</p>
<p>Such as Weights &amp; Biases for tracking your machine learning experiments or full-blown enterprise AI solutions like DataRobot.</p>
<p><strong>Post 2: <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">ML is going real-time</a></strong></p>
<p>In this post Chip breaks down ML going real-time into <strong>online predictions</strong> and <strong>online learning</strong> and emphasises the importance of speed in machine learning. </p>
<p>The simple analogy goes like this: if your app is slow, people won’t use it.</p>
<p>For <strong>online predictions</strong> (predictions made <em>while</em> someone is using your ML system), if they’re slow, people will get tired of them. For some systems, such as self-driving cars, fast online predictions are required. The classic trade off here is how much performance do you sacrifice for speed (e.g. smaller models are faster but don’t score as well).</p>
<p>For <strong>online learning</strong> (how quickly does your ML system update itself?), if you’re getting new data every hour but only updating your models every week, is your service performing as well as it should? This is a tough problem. Because traditionally ML is taught with static data (train, validation, test sets) but when you get to large scale, you’ve got data (called streaming data) coming in all the time so what exactly should you train and evaluate on? </p>
<p>Take the example of a recommendation system such as Netflix, if there’s a new series out and everyone is watching so you get recommended it but then you try it out and don’t like it. But because Netflix only update their system once a week, the new series stays on your homepage for a whole week (it doesn’t take into account you didn’t like it), is that a good experience? </p>
<p>How should one do online learning?</p>
<p>This is still being worked out. But Chip’s post talks more about the pain points and possible solutions.</p>
<h3>Use GitHub for your Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)</h3>
<p>If your code is on GitHub, why not use it to do all of your MLOps (model evaluation, model retraining, continuous integration, continuous deployment) as well?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mlops.githubapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow">GitHub for MLOps</a> page is a collection of blog posts, examples, talks and tools (e.g. GitHub Actions) showcasing how you can facilitate MLOps with GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Find yourself running a series of similar experiments over and over? </p>
<p>Automate, automate, automate.</p>
<p>Use GitHub to watch your codebase for updates and then every time you commit a change, run a series of experiments behind the scenes (such as testing your models and then posting the results in a GitHub issue for you).</p>
<h3>Upgrade your software engineering skills as a machine learning practitioner</h3>
<p>If you’re like me and learned to write Python code in Jupyter Notebooks, when you first heard someone say things like: “just put it into a Python script”, “run this bash command”, “put an API on top of your model and deploy it”, “wrap your app in a Docker container” and thought “wtf???”</p>
<p>LJ Mirander’s post on <em><a href="https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/11/15/data-science-swe/" target="_blank" rel="follow">How to improve software engineering skills as a (data science) researcher</a></em> uses the narrative of creating a machine learning service (an app which uses machine learning) and then explains each of the above and how they fit together.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get your machine learning models into the hands of others, software engineering skills like the ones LJ discusses are crucial. </p>
<h3>freeCodeCamp's (upcoming) Data Science &amp; Machine Learning curriculum</h3>
<p>Coming soon from one the best resources to learn to code online: a full-blown data science &amp; machine learning curriculum.</p>
<p>freeCodeCamp started out teaching web development for free in the browser. </p>
<p>Now they’re gearing up to do the same with data science and machine learning.</p>
<p>From foundational mathematics (linear algebra, matrix algebra, calculus) to EDA (exploratory data analysis), to supervised and unsupervised algorithms to tools like SQL, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, when its done, this’ll be an outstanding resource.</p>
<p>All for free!</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Educational resources are already abundant. There’s a shortage of willingness to learn. </p>
<p>But what helps grow that willingness to learn is world-class educators who inspire others to create their own path. And freeCodeCamp is full of world-class educators.</p>

<h2><strong>Let's dive in. Here's what you missed in February 2021 as a Python Developer…</strong></h2>
<h3>Python Dilemma  ⚖️</h3>
<p><a href="https://aroberge.blogspot.com/2021/02/pythons-tug-of-war-between-beginner.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">This was an interesting article</a>. Python has become the most popular language in the world because it is so beginner friendly. However, as more and more people use it, the need to include more advanced features grows as well. This is a challenge that all technical projects face as time passes and they grow.</p>
<h3>Weekend Project Idea 🎏</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/building-rich-terminal-dashboards/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Rich</a> is a python tool that allows you to beautify CLIs. This weekend, spend some time making all of your CLIs beautiful so you look like you are doing important work at your home or coffee shop or when your boss walks behind you (you know, once people go back to offices of course).</p>
<h3>Constant Folding In Python 🧬</h3>
<p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is Constant Folding where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner. <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learn all about it in this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Integers 🥇</h3>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers, also known as bignums. No idea what any of that means? <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-8-how-python-integers-work/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Read all about integers here</a>.</p>
<h3>Pyston vs CPython ⚾️ 🥎</h3>
<p>Pyston 2.1 Is Blowing Past Python 3.8/3.9 Performance. With this past week's release of Pyston 2.1 as an alternative Python interpreter I was curious to see how the performance compared to that of upstream Python... <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Pyston-2.1-vs-Python-3.8-3.9" target="_blank" rel="follow">So here are some weekend benchmarks with a Ryzen 9 5900X system</a>.</p>
<h3>WTF Python 🤸‍♀️</h3>
<p>Python, being a beautifully designed high-level and interpreter-based programming language, provides us with many features for the programmer's comfort. But sometimes, the outcomes of a Python snippet may not seem obvious at first sight.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython" target="_blank" rel="follow">Here's a fun project</a> attempting to explain what exactly is happening under the hood for some counter-intuitive snippets and lesser-known features in Python.</p>
<h3>Google Sponsors Python 💰</h3>
<p>Google has become a visionary sponsor for the Python Software Foundation. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">You do that by donating a lot of money</a>. Nice to see the support!</p>
<h3>Pattern Matching in Python 🎲</h3>
<p>The Python steering council has, after some discussion, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/845480/" target="_blank" rel="follow">accepted</a> the controversial proposal to add a pattern-matching primitive to the language. The pattern matching process takes as input a pattern (following <code>case</code>) and a subject value (following <code>match</code>). <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learn all about it here</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Strings Are Immutable 💡</h3>
<p>Each time you make a change to a string variable, you are actually producing a brand new string. Because of this, tutorials out there warn you to avoid string concatenation inside a loop and advise using join instead for performance reasons. Even the official documentation says so!</p>
<p>This is wrong. Sort of.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/pythonstringsaremutable.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">There is a common case for when strings in Python are actually mutable</a>.</p>
<p>Once you are confused by that one, <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-9-how-python-strings-work/" target="_blank" rel="follow">read this</a>.</p>
<h3>Data Analysis Trick  📈</h3>
<p>A great strategy to use when faced with a tricky data analysis problem is to reshape the dataset into a format that turns it into an easy problem. In this article we will look at an example involving a simple calculation and extensive reshaping. <a href="https://drawingfromdata.com/pandas/reshaping/Making-a-difficult-data-analysis-problem-trivial.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">Here is a walkthrough of how to do it</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Microservices With gRPC 🏭</h3>
<p>Microservices are a way to organize complex software systems. Instead of putting all your code into one app, you break your app into microservices that are deployed independently and communicate with each other. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-microservices-grpc/" target="_blank" rel="follow">This tutorial</a> teaches you how to get up and running with Python microservices using gRPC, one of the most popular frameworks.</p>
<h3>Do Benchmarks Matter? 🪤</h3>
<p><a href="https://suade.org/dev/12-requests-per-second-with-python/" target="_blank" rel="follow">I highly recommend this read</a>. The summary? If your python  service is receiving 100,000 requests a second, it's likely that the specific Python framework you use is not going to be the bottleneck. Especially if your API is stateless and you can scale it via Kubernetes or similar. At that point, a good database, with decent schema design and good architecture are going to matter far more. Having said that, if you do want more processing power, use PyPy... just don't worry about the web frameworks you use.</p>
<h3>Concurrency With Python 🚿</h3>
<p>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each. <a href="https://python.hamel.dev/concurrency/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Enjoy</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>32nd issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=WDM#monthly">read the previous issues of our Web Developer Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>If it’s your first time here… (otherwise, skip this part)</strong></h2>
<p>Being a web developer is a fantastic career option. You have many job opportunities, you can work around the world, and you get to solve hard problems. </p>
<p>One hard thing, however, is staying up to date with the constantly evolving ecosystem. You want to be a top-performing web developer, coder, programmer, software developer, but you don’t have time to select from hundreds of articles, videos and podcasts each day.</p>
<p>This monthly newsletter is focused on keeping you up to date with the industry, keeping your skills sharp, without wasting your valuable time. I curate and share the most important articles, news, resources, podcasts and videos of the month. </p>
<p>Think <a href="https://tim.blog/about" target="_blank" rel="follow">Tim Ferriss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" rel="follow">the Pareto Principle</a> (80/20 rule) meeting the Software Development world. What’s the 20% that will get you 80% of the results?</p>

<h2><strong>Let's dive in. Here's what you missed in February 2021 as a Web Developer…</strong></h2>
<h3>Architecture.md 🦾</h3>
<p>An interesting idea around including this type of file in all of your projects. The idea? As the name suggest, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project. Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it. Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change. This is the main rule of thumb for ARCHITECTURE — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change. Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code. Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.</p>
<h3>Free Tools For Web Developers ✂️</h3>
<p>Some tools and assets to help you build your next project since we are best friends by now (<em>unless this is your first time reading my articles… in that case let’s take things slow</em>):</p>

<h3>JavaScript Memory Management 🧠</h3>
<p>Most of the time, you can probably get by fine not knowing anything about memory management as a JavaScript developer. After all, the JavaScript engine handles this for you. At one point or another, though, you'll encounter problems, like memory leaks, that you can only solve if you know how memory allocation works.</p>
<p><a href="https://felixgerschau.com/javascript-memory-management" target="_blank" rel="follow">In this article</a>, you will learn how memory allocation and garbage collection works and how you can avoid some common memory leaks.</p>

<li>Looks like even Amazon is all aboard the React train. They now have a new tutorial on their website: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-server-side-rendering-for-react-in-aws-lambda/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Building server-side rendering for React in AWS Lambda</a>. Don't worry, they haven't forgotten about Vue 3 either: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/amplify-javascript-releases-support-for-vue-3/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Amplify JavaScript releases support for Vue 3</a></li>

<h3>New Browser Has Entered The Chat 👾</h3>
<p><a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/beam/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Beam has raised $9.5m</a> to take on some of the biggest browser companies in the world like Microsoft, Google and Mozilla, by creating a new web browser. Looks like they will be using Chromium underneath the hood. <em>“It’s basically a cultural search engine.”</em></p>
<h3>No More Frontend 😿</h3>
<p><a href="https://soynomm.com/blog/i-dont-want-to-do-frontend-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="follow">An interesting opinion piece</a> of a frontend developer who has had enough and wants to focus on backend development. <em>"I suppose with the increase of complexity in what we want to achieve on the web the stack to achieve it with has had to also increase in complexity. For me, personally, it's too much. I want to have a personal life and not have to spend my nights reading up on some new flavour of .js in fear that if I don't I would soon be made irrelevant. I don't want to learn nor use a million different tools. I don't want to know a bit about everything and a lot about nothing."</em></p>
<h3>Interesting Question Of The Month 🕺</h3>
<p>This should be changed to QUESTIONS of the month, because there are 7. Can you answer <a href="https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-closures-interview-questions" target="_blank" rel="follow">these 7 JavaScript closures interview questions</a>? Share your results!</p>
<h3>Deno Fanboy 🦕</h3>
<p>My heavy bias towards Deno must be present in all newsletters, so here it is: <a href="https://evrone.com/ryan-dahl-interview" target="_blank" rel="follow">An interview with the creator of Deno: Ryan Dhal</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Google Proposes New Sandbox 🧨</h3>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="follow">is proposing a new idea</a> to keep advertising on the web but with a more privacy focus in mind. How? Interest-based advertising. They call it
Federated Learning of Cohorts <em>(uh la la, sounds fancy)</em>. It proposes a new way for businesses to reach people with relevant content and ads by clustering large groups of people with similar interests. This approach effectively hides individuals “in the crowd” and uses on-device processing to keep a person’s web history private on the browser. </p>
<h3>Functions As Callbacks 📞</h3>
<p>A simple message in this one - Don't use functions as callbacks unless they're designed for it. Jake always has great articles and this one <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2021/function-callback-risks/" target="_blank" rel="follow">does not disappoint</a>.</p>

I present to you what you should do this weekend: <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux" target="_blank" rel="follow">Getting better at Linux with 10 mini-projects</a></p>

<p><span>I</span>f you’re a woman in India, getting from A to B is a series of negotiations. Leaving the house for a trip to the market? First there’s figuring out how to get there. A taxi? No guarantee of a metered fare, and the driver might flat out refuse, depending on where you’re going. The metro? Faster than the bus, but there’s the long walk to the station, and sidewalks are a luxury in much of urban India. Then there’s harassment, an experience so widespread in public areas that over <a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20160523153959-37tlt/">80% of women</a> in Indian cities say they have faced it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When rideshare companies like Uber and Ola <a href="https://qz.com/india/1696728/ola-has-a-lead-over-uber-in-indias-ride-hailing-market/">entered India in the early 2010s</a>, these logistical negotiations changed. In the years since, rideshare apps have become a lifeline for women in urban areas, an alternative to risks they faced on public transport or in taxis. That’s not to say rideshares remove the risk altogether: in 2014, a 26-year-old Delhi woman was kidnapped and raped by her Uber driver, a case that led to a lawsuit against Uber for how they <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42291495">handled the victim’s medical records</a>. The app was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/world/asia/new-delhi-bans-uber-after-driver-is-accused-of-rape.html">banned in Delhi</a> for over a year but has since grown to dominate the market along with its local competitor Ola; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-india-ola-analysis/uber-seen-girding-for-battle-with-ola-in-india-ahead-of-ipo-idUSKBN1H424L">combined, the two companies hold 80% of the Indian taxi market</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ubiquity of rideshare cabs has had a lasting impact on the urban-dwelling women of India, with ripple effects reaching stay-at-home moms, workers, and college students. <em>Rest of World </em>spoke to six women who live in Kolkata, a city of 14 million, about how rideshares have changed the way they navigate their city.</p>

<h3>Menka Danda, 36</h3>



<h4><em>The beautician who needs her husband to book her rides</em></h4>



<p>As a beautician, my work takes me to all corners of Kolkata; I work through an app called Urban Company to provide at-home spa services. Often, it’ll be a new client whose house I’ve never been to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Uber came along, I used to take the buses. They’re always so crowded. My supply bags are huge and heavy; I carry all of my equipment in them and have to lug them around from client to client. On the bus or metro, sometimes there are no seats. Carrying the bags gets so tiring; by the time I’d reach my clients, I’d be exhausted. And in the summers, the heat is unbearable. If I have more clients in a day, I’ll always take Uber. If I take the bus, it takes so long, I can only visit one to two clients. On Uber, I can do four in one day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beauty service company trained me to use their app, but I’ve only studied till the sixth grade. Everything on the beauty app is in English, so I have difficulty reading the addresses for the clients I’m supposed to visit. Uber is the same way. I don’t know how to use the app on my own. My husband tags along with me on jobs, to help book the car on Uber and transfer addresses from the beauty service app. He used to be a private tutor for kids in our area, but since the lockdown, he hasn’t had much work. He’s like my assistant now. Because I’m not educated — even though I’m independent and the sole breadwinner in the family right now — I’m dependent on him.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>It would be so much easier if I could use the app on my own. If it were in Hindi, it’d be much better.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When my husband can’t come with me, I ask the client, “Ma’am, I don’t know how to book rides on Uber, can you use the app on my mobile phone?” They can usually do it; you just have to ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be so much easier if I could use the app on my own. If it were in Hindi, it’d be much better. But really, I wish I could just open the app and say, “I’m here, OK, come pick me up!” I wish I could just say it instead of having to type it out.</p>

<h3><strong>Lynette Hilt</strong>, 55</h3>



<h4><em>The <strong>stay-at-home mom who says Uber has changed her social life</strong></em></h4>



<p>I was a huge party animal. I used to go to nightclubs or to people’s houses for dinner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 1996 to 2003, I had a car and used to drive in Kolkata. Then I moved to Bangalore for two years and sold my car before the move. When I came back, I was dependent on friends for a ride. I used to turn down a lot of outings because of transportation, because it was so embarrassing to ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respect is the most important thing to me. I was so particular about my reputation that I missed a lot of opportunities. Once, I got all dressed up to go out and stood on the road waiting for a taxi that didn’t come. Eventually, I had to give up and walk back home. It was so sad.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>As a single woman, I don’t have to depend on a man to pick me up or drop me home.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Uber has become a lifeline and a status symbol. I am very safe. Uber comes right to the door. If it’s late at night, I have my 23-year-old son book it so that he can track me. As a single woman, I don’t have to depend on a man to pick me up or drop me home. I use them to go everywhere: the airport, the movies, the doctor, school-reunion parties, Sunday brunch, and to take my parents to the hospital for checkups. If it’s a short distance to get to church, then I take a moto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drivers are very well-dressed and very decent. I have a knee problem, so when I get off the moto, I have to hold them for support. I need reconstruction surgery. By that time in the trip, we have become friends. I tell them half my life history. We talk about religion. I tell them I have a son their age, but I don’t tell them that I live alone. I don’t mind if they speed.</p>

<h3><strong>Chaahat Mandhyan</strong>, 25</h3>



<h4><em>The<strong> professional wealth manager who says the pandemic has made her dependent on men again</strong></em></h4>



<p>I took the bus only very occasionally because I feel claustrophobic. Uber Go in Kolkata is not economical. Uber Pool is, but you have to sit in it with a mindset that it’s going to take 30 to 40 minutes longer than it normally would. I’m always running late.</p>



<p>In Uber Go, I read about the markets in the papers on my way to work. On the Uber Moto, I listen to music. My favorite song is “We Didn’t Start the Fire” by Billy Joel. Five minutes before I reach work, I play this song, and I’m all pumped up. Before the pandemic, I would spend 6,000 bucks (about $82) a month on Uber.</p>

<p>The pandemic has increased my dependency on the male members of my community, like my building’s security guard. We bought a scooty so that my guard can drop me off and pick me up at the office. If I keep him waiting because I get delayed trying to finish work, then I get to hear him scream. I don’t know how to ride a scooty, and I’m really scared of sitting on it. My hands are constantly sweating. I just have to get over my fear of an accident. It’s more economical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night in December 2019, I took an Uber Go, around 8:30 p.m. I was going to a friend’s party and wearing a dress that came below my knees. I was carrying a shawl. It was cold. I set the Uber to drop me off at a place where my friend would pick me up from there. But I was late, and my friend got pissed, and he took off. Then I changed the destination on my Uber to the location of the party, about 6 kilometers away.</p>

<p>The driver said he wouldn’t go. Then he grabbed my ankle and ran his hand over it. I went blank. I removed his hand, and I said, “What’re you doing?” He turned around to talk to me. I got damn pissed and got out of the cab. I filed a complaint with Uber, but nothing happened. I didn’t want to create a scene. I couldn’t find an Uber, and I didn’t want to take a normal cab to such a big party. Uber is a matter of status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if my phone conks off, I know I can charge my phone in an Uber. I feel safer knowing that I can use the maps on the Uber driver’s phone. But if you’re sitting in a yellow cab and if your phone’s not working or if it’s conked off, there’s no way of tracking. Charging phones is a huge plus point.</p>

<h3><strong>Dorothy Nair</strong>, 44</h3>



<h4><em>The<strong> primary school teacher who is afraid of driving</strong></em></h4>



<p>My husband is in the army, so we’ve moved every two years. We’ve lived all over. We’ve seen Punjab; we’ve been towards Maharashtra; we were in Ahmednagar; we stayed in Pune, Kapurthala, Pathankot, Amritsar, and Babina. Now we’re in Kolkata. My husband’s post is in Ambala. While he was here, we were able to use the army transport; the vehicle was available on call. But when the husband is posted elsewhere, then you don’t have the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I used to drive many years ago, when my daughters were small, but now I’m scared of driving. Once, I got into an accident in a very crowded area. One of those public buses banged into the car. It was such a crowded place, nothing could be done, and we couldn’t stop. I was worried about my daughter; she was with me, and she was very little. Ever since, I’ve been too afraid. When we came to Kolkata, I joined a driving school, and my friend would come with me. Maybe I’ll drive again when we can get a fully automatic car, the one where all you have to do is press a button. When my husband sends both his daughters abroad, and there’s money left over, maybe we can get a Tesla!</p>

It will probably only take a few years since most of the components are here already. It's just putting them together into a nice service thats missing.</strong></blockquote><p>‍</p><h2>How did we do it?</h2><p>We started experimenting with CLIP and BigGAN through <a href="https://twitter.com/advadnoun">Ryan Murdocks </a>"Big Sleep". We were testing what kind of images we could get by asking it to draw a green robot rocket with big cute eyes. At first the results were not very promising, but then something clicked, by nudging it with multiple different instructions it would not get stuck at a certain spot. Creating an endless stream of robots. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603cc19e0e844204feec4f1a_Screenshot%202021-03-01%20at%2011.21.49.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KH7VdJoUlw"></iframe></p></figure><p>Around 02:00 I realized that it probably would be able to understand what I was after! </p><p>‍</p><h4>Phase 1</h4><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fYlQvbH7dM"></iframe></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TB-rHfjsXrY"></iframe></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNdiuLiTHqs"></iframe></p></figure><p>A frenzy of generation attempts and various methods followed from all three of us. We added reference images for the model to look at and also wrote some instructions such as "a rocket-robot" and "a robot with two cute eyes". We realized this was a viable method to get inspiration for our logo.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What is creativity? What is design?</h4><p>I'd argue that compression is a big part of it. Take cubism. The real world exists, cubes exists. Compress them and a creative piece is born. If there is something Neural networks and transformers are good at, it is compression. So if creativity is partly compression we would see evidence of "creativity" in these experiments. Searching and mixing between styles and objects to reach a goal. </p><p>Lets have a look at Filips <em>meme</em>-moment. <strong>LEMON&nbsp;DWARF</strong>!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79666417d71ef34a02cf_IMG_3121.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d798c81f70d59b82c8b9f_IMG_3122.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79b6a4585130a6c39613_IMG_3123.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79cefb777fb68d4bd739_IMG_3124.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhaZJtf9xf0"></iframe></p></figure><p>Filip had multiple instructions. Such as "a robot with big eyes", an image of a robot, and another image of a dwarf. Then once in a while the instructions "A lemon" is added. So now its forced to change its normal struggle to output a mix of a robot and a dwarf. Now it has to add a lemon in to the mix. <strong>The result is a LEMON&nbsp;DWARF ROBOT!</strong></p><p>Even if this is not true "AI-creativity" the lines are definitely turning blurrier. The model drawing is not trained on dwarfs or robots. It's just mixing its ability to draw a cassette player, a car and a dog to create something different, in between those objects.</p><h3>Phase 2</h3><p>After generating over 200.000 various cute robots we wanted something different. I created a new method for the interaction between BigGAN and CLIP to get different results. We switched around the reference images and started experiment a bit, creating reference images ourselves.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgarBSNbV0c"></iframe></p></figure><p>Heres we used the old instructions and reference images but added minimalism as instruction.

<p><a href="https://text.bargains/">Amulet</a> version 1<br>
2021-2-21</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>An amulet is a kind of poem that depends on language, code, and luck. To qualify, a poem must satisfy these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its complete Unicode text is 64 bytes or less. [1]</li>
<li>The hexadecimal SHA-256 hash of the text includes four or more 8s in a row. [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of poem was designed to be recorded, collected, and traded as an NFT using <a href="http://zora.engineering/">the Zora protocol</a>, but it can happily exist anywhere; an amulet absolutely does not have to be recorded on a blockchain to be an amulet.</p>
<p>If it is recorded, an additional formal criterion applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A carbon offset (1 metric ton or more) is purchased to compensate for the CO2 produced by the poem’s life on the blockchain, with proof of that purchase included in the poem’s metadata. (Here’s a <a href="https://text.bargains/amulet-metadata-sample.json">metadata template</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other rules! An amulet can be written in any language and any style. It can be composed, generated, or “discovered” in any way.</p>
<p>The number of sequential 8s in the hash determines the rarity of the amulet:</p>
<ul>
<li>8888: common</li>
<li>88888: uncommon</li>
<li>888888: rare</li>
<li>8888888: epic</li>
<li>88888888: legendary</li>
<li>888888888: mythic</li>
<li>8888888888+: ???</li>
</ul>
<p>And, while this isn’t part of the formal definition, it’s important to say that an amulet of any rarity should be judged by its overall effect, with consideration for both its linguistic and typographic qualities. In particular, an amulet’s whitespace, punctuation, and diacritics should all be “load bearing”.</p>
<p>A poem doesn’t become interesting simply by satisfying the constraints of some obscure form; likewise, an amulet isn’t collectible simply because it’s rare.</p>
<p>But... it doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p>A few stray considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Special appreciation is reserved for the amulet that is, in any sense, “aware of its circumstances”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is tempting to stylize “amulet” as “amul8”; this, unfortunately, is too dorky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is significant luck involved in the production of amulets; you might consider them bouillon cubes of fortune, useful as ingredients in other recipes, digital and occult.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>[1] Unicode (UTF-8) characters often require more than one byte; most programming languages provide a function to determine the byte size of a string.</p>
<p>[2] For most programmers, the SHA-256 hash function will be familiar and close to hand. For other readers interested in seeing how it works, <a href="https://text.bargains/scratchpad">this scratchpad might be useful</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Hash_standard">SHA-256 hash function</a> is ubiquitous in cryptography. In Zora, for example, it’s used to verify the identity of a piece of media, like a fingerprint. That media could be an MP4 movie, a PNG image, or a poem in plain text; if you change one frame, one pixel, or one comma, you change the SHA-256 hash entirely.</p>
<p>The hash is a cold hexadecimal spew –</p>
<p>9a120001cc88888363fc67c45f2c52447ae64808d497ec9d699dba0d74d72aab</p>
<p>– and, like a fingerprint, it doesn’t tell you anything about the entity it identifies. That’s by design, but even so, it feels strange for a value so pivotal to be totally disconnected from the underlying content, especially when it is <em>this value</em> that’s being collected and traded in cryptographic marketplaces.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the hash provides an immutable link between unique cryptographic object and free-floating digital media.</p>
<p>The amulet asks: what if we took that link seriously?</p>
<p>In a sense, the definition of the SHA-256 hash function created, at a stroke, all amulets of all rarities. Common to mythic, trashy to lovely, they have been hiding in the manifold combinations of language; we just didn’t know we ought to be looking for them. Until now!</p>
<p>How should we feel about this? I will invoke an amulet of uncommon rarity; you saw its SHA-256 hash above, five 8s in a row, lucky indeed:</p>

<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/maths-as-a-compiler/intro.png"></p>
<p>You might have heard of a mathematician named Gauss. He’s known for a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">contributions in mathematics</a> but my favorite contribution has a story. As <a href="https://www.nctm.org/Publications/Teaching-Children-Mathematics/Blog/The-Story-of-Gauss/">story goes</a> there was a maths teacher who wanted to read the newspaper while he was supposed to be teaching. So instead of teaching the teacher gave his pupils the assignment to add the numbers 1 through 100.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
s = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 98 + 99 + 100 = ?
\]</span> Instead of blindly calculating away, which was what most of the other students did, the young Gauss looked at the problem and started wondering if there perhaps was a more clever way of looking at the problem. After skribbling down some ideas he noticed a pattern.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
  s &amp; =  &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; 98 &amp; 99 &amp; 100   \\
  s &amp; =   &amp; 100   &amp; 99 &amp; 98 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1  
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Maybe we can calculate <span>\(s\)</span> in another way.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
    &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; 98 &amp; 99 &amp; 100   \\
  +  &amp; 100   &amp; 99 &amp; 98 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1 \\  
    \hline 
  = &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; \ldots &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>It seems that if we sort cleverly the sum of these two identical series can also be expressed as a multiplication</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\underbrace{
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
   &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; \ldots &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 
\end{array}
}_{100 \times 101 = 10100} 
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words;</p>
<p><span>\[ 
s = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
\]</span></p>

<p>What’s very neat about this “rethinking” is that it can also be generalized. If we’re interested in taking the sum from <span>\(1 \ldots n\)</span> then we can repeat the same trick.</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
    &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; n-2 &amp; n-1 &amp; n   \\
  + &amp; n   &amp; n-1 &amp; n-2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1   \\
  \hline 
  = &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; \ldots &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>This will give us the general formula.</p>
<p><span>\[
1 + \ldots + n = \sum_{x=1}^n x= \frac{n\times(n+1)}{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The brilliance of this is in recognizing that there are multiple ways of calculating the thing we’re interested in. Instead of doing a whole lof of addition, we can apply a mere multiplication and still get the same result.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful point, because it gives another angle to mathematics. There’s a “computer-science-voice” inside of me that’s looking at this and wondering if maybe … maths can be applied much more like a compiler than a calculator?</p>
<p>Think about it! This example shows that you might be able to rephrase an original problem into one that is much easier to calculate. We’re literally generating an alternative set of instructions. Just like the kid in the classroom, our program might also spend less time performing a multiplication compared to a long sequence of additions.</p>
<p>It’s a compiler that is potentially “better” too.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>You can actually run this as an experiment.</p>
<pre><code>
import numba as nb

def calc_sum(n):
    return sum(i for i in range(1, n + 1))

def calc_smart(n):
    return n * (n+1) / 2

@nb.njit
def calc_sum_compiled(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res += i
    return res

@nb.njit
def calc_smart_compiled(n):
    return n * (n+1) / 2</code></pre>

<p>Even <em>if</em> we use the JIT compiler from <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html">numba</a> then we still see that we can get a huge speedup by using maths as a compiler. The fastest results are achieved by using both the compiler and the maths but the example is sufficient to show that you’re able to improve a compiler by using maths.</p>

            <section>
                <p>On August 24th, 1967 Charles A Kiesling at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperry_Corporation">Sperry Rand</a> filed a patent for 'Blinking Cursor for CRT Display'. One of the earliest innovations in the history of graphical user interface design, Kiesling’s patent allowed programmers to quickly see where the next character will be input on their console screen.</p><p>We all take the flashing cursor for granted today, but in the 1960s this was one of a succession of innovations that brought programmers closers to their code. Thanks to the introduction of electronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube">cathode ray tubes</a> (CRTs) just a few years earlier, programmers could now interact with their code directly through terminals connected to a console screen. Displaying character sets linked directly to a mainframe computer, the console not only increased a programmer’s productivity, it also offered the world a new perspective and relationship to computing that would go on to inspire future generations.</p><p>Kiesling lays out the problem to be solved with the blinking cursor in his <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3531796">original patent:</a></p><blockquote><em>The cursor in presently available systems has not satisfactorily performed the function for which it was intended. Whenever the cursor is positioned over a character that has already been painted on the screen, it becomes difficult to locate it. The more characters on the screen the more difficult it becomes to locate the cursor.</em></blockquote><p>Kiesling would stay at Sperry Rand until his retirement in 1993, where his designs and ideas helped lay the foundation for the modern computer world.</p><h2 id="computers-with-personality-a-love-of-consoles">Computers with Personality: A Love of Consoles</h2><p>Computing is so often a story of what’s coming next.

Console. </p><p>Like much of the very best technology and design, its easy to forget the lineage of iterations that got us here.

Before the console, programmers interfaced with mainframe computers via a standalone terminal. Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY) - effectively a typewriter to enter the data into a computing system. Limited to the input of data, these early terminals were often referred to as dumb terminals that pre-dated computer console screens.</p><h3 id="the-model-33">The Model 33</h3><div><p>The archetypal teletype was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">Teletype Model 33</a> originally designed for the United States Navy, the Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 33 in 1963. The Model 33 was one of the first products to employ the newly standardized ASCII code.</p><p>Costing $700, the Model 33 was far more affordable than other options and with the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor">Video Display Unit</a> (VDU) consoles costing in excess of $10,000, its popularity extended well into the 1970s. By 1975 over 500,000 Model 32 and 33s were manufactured, going on to become one of the most popular terminals in history.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Teletype Model 33 introduced Bill Gates to programming. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33#/media/File:Teletype-IMG_7287.jpg">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The historical impact of the Model 33 was notable. The programming language BASIC was designed to be written and edited on a low-speed Teletype Model 33, with the slow speed of the Teletype Model 33 influencing the later user interface of minicomputer operating systems, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a>.</p><p>Fun fact: Bill Gates cites the Teletype Model 33 as his first computing experience. In 1973 Gates’ Lakeside Prep School Mothers Club used its garage sale proceeds to give students computer access. The club purchased a Model-33 teletype machine that connected over phone lines to a GE time sharing computer.</p><h3 id="glass-teletypes-and-the-console-vdus">Glass Teletypes and the Console: VDUs</h3><div><p>It wasn’t until the mid-1960s that the first glass teletypes entered the market, combing an input terminal with a Video Display Unit (VDU). The early consoles were relatively primitive, lacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>. They relied on individual logic gates and simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#Large-scale_integration_(LSI)">LSI chips</a>, and were still connected to mainframe computers to do all the processing.</p><p>The shift to an ‘intelligent terminal’ was identifiable through the device’s ability to process inputs by the user with the terminal sending a block of data at time, rather than interrupting the main processing computer after every keystroke.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 1182w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Datapoint 3300 - One of the first general purpose video terminals. <a href="http://www.kuonlinedirectory.org/studygroups/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Almost-Forgotten-Story-of-Computer-Terminal-Corporation_4_2_16_small.pdf">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Designed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint">Computer Terminal Corporation</a>, the Datapoint 3300 was the first successful general purpose video terminal designed to compete with the Model 33 teletype.

It also set the benchmark for business video terminals with an 8 bit general purpose CPU, 24 x 80 green phosphor display, consumer friendly ergonomics and a futuristic design.</p><h3 id="ascii">ASCII</h3><div><p>As the use of terminals became more commonplace and new companies began to enter the market, so there was an increasing need for a standardization of character encoding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> (abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was developed from telegraph code, with the first commercial use in a seven-bit teleprinter developed by Bell Data Systems. </p><p>Based on the English alphabet, ASCII originally encoded 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers. Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable, including the digits 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, and punctuation symbols. The remaining 33 non-printing control codes originated from Teletype machines, though most of these are now obsolete. Later in 1981, <a href="https://blog.console.dev/p/97d42dc1-d2c1-464e-ab20-d160e7b34e7f/www.ibm.com">IBM</a> developed an extension called ‘code page 437’. In this version, some obsolete characters were replaced for graphic characters and a further 128 characters ranging from 128 to 255 were added. </p><p>With 95 printable characters in the original ASCII from 1963, it also offered artistically minded programmers the tools to create beautiful imagery from just a fixed width prompt.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1660w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Mad magazine's Alfred E.

The new protocol allowed similar sequences of input to be interpreted by the terminal as commands rather than text to be displayed on the console. </p><p>This standardization was popularized by the Digital VT100 in 1978, and thanks to the success, led to most new terminals and emulators that followed to support them. Over six million terminals in the VT series were sold based on the success of the VT100. Even today the majority of terminal emulators still interpret a portion of the original ANSI standard. </p><p>Designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> (DEC), DEC was one of the major players of the computer industry from the 1960s until the 1990s, when it struggled to compete in an increasingly competitive market driven by home computing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1990w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>DEC VT100 terminal at the Living Computer Museum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100#/media/File:DEC_VT100_terminal.jpg">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="monochrome-monitors">Monochrome Monitors </h3><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg 764w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hollywood was quick to embrace the rise of the console screen, quickly introducing the console as a protagonist in some of the biggest films of the 1970s and 80s.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				
<p>In Part 1, <a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/2021/01/17/hacking-super-monkey-ball-part-1-banana-bunch-values/" data-type="post" data-id="645">we used Dolphin’s debugger to find the location of Player 1’s score in RAM</a>. In this article, our goal is to hack the score calculation routine so that the bonus goals do not award so many points.</p>



<p>Levels in Super Monkey Ball can have up to three separate exits: the normal Blue exit, a Green exit, and a Red exit. If you manage to get to a Green or Red exit, the game will let you skip a number of upcoming levels (e.g. skip the next 3 levels). In addition, it multiplies the score for completing the level by the number of levels skipped (e.g. you gain 3 times as many points as you would have with the normal exit). This is a totally bonkers amount of points, especially for levels which you can complete in only a few seconds and so also get the time bonus multiplier. In the below screenshot, the normal Blue exit would have awarded 3,386 points. Instead the game awards <em>130,158</em> points because I completed the level with the Red exit! There is some fun in a risk/reward calculation, but not when it’s this lopsided!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="390" height="188" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png 390w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px"></a></figure>



<p>It really incentivizes you to skip levels, which means you play less of the game, which… sucks. If we eliminate the level skip bonus entirely, then it becomes a more interesting trade-off. You can either skip a few levels and so be less likely to lose lives but lose out on score, or you can choose to risk completing those levels and gain all the points from those levels you would have skipped. It’s a much more interesting mechanic than always choosing the Red exit to get that massive score dump.</p>



<p>So let’s start by finding the code that alters your score upon level completion. As in part 1, we set a memory watch breakpoint on Player 1’s score, then complete the level. As the score tally displays, Dolphin breaks and we have our score routine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="635" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-768x477.png 768w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s a couple interesting things to notice in this screenshot. First, you can see the current instruction is storing the updated score into our player’s struct, which is what we expected/hoped to find. Just before that is where it adds the new points into the existing score. You can see in <code>r4</code> and <code>r5</code> are the new score value to be added and the player’s current score, respectively. So this really looks like the routine we wanted to find. Finally, notice the <code>LR</code> value, which is where we jumped from to get into this routine. Let’s head to that code and see what called this routine. More specifically, we want to know where the beginning of this routine is, since we’ve paused execution somewhere in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="102" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png 512w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure>



<p>That tells us where the score calculation routine actually begins. Let’s go see what happens there at the start of this function.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="469" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png 500w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure>



<p>Well that… sure is some PowerPC code. I can read assembly if I have to, but that looks like a real chore to try to understand. Notice the start of the routine is something like 500 bytes away from where the actual store happens. I don’t want to try to understand that much assembly.</p>



<p>Well luckily, just a few years ago the NSA (yes, that NSA) made their internal software reverse-engineering (SRE) tool <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Ghidra</a> public. Among many other things, it is capable of disassembling binaries into C source. I figured it probably was capable of handling PPC binaries (it is), but I wondered if anyone had specifically tried it with a GameCube binary. Turns out somebody had: I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hmapl.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/ghidra-a-potentially-useful-reverse-engineering-tool/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about using a Ghidra plugin for the GameCube’s PPC variant to decompile Harvest Moon. I also found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader" target="_blank">a Ghidra plugin specifically for loading GameCube binaries</a> dumped from ISOs. It’s pretty painless to install. Once that’s done, you can use Dolphin to dump the game’s executable to disk, to load into Ghidra. Extract the game’s system data using Dolphin, and it will dump some binaries into a directory.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png"><img loading="lazy" width="823" height="751" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png 823w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-300x274.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-768x701.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px"></a></figure>



<p>The one we’re interested in is main.dol, which is the game’s main executable. Loading that into Ghidra will prompt you to analyze the binary. On my machine, that only took about a minute to complete. Now I was ready to see if Ghidra could turn that PPC code into readable C code. So I jumped to the start of the score routine and…</p>

<p>It worked! Without any symbol names, the code is hard to read, but it’s legible enough. This was so exciting to see!! I’ve been wanting to hack this score code for at least a decade. And look at those if-statements! They’re comparing something against ‘<code>G</code>‘ and ‘<code>R</code>‘. Green and Red exits, perhaps? I couldn’t wait to figure out what this code was doing.</p>



<p>I’ve inserted the code in text format here, with some interesting lines highlighted for discussion below.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the raw code, you can see some interesting stuff. At [1] is our current PC, that <code>stw</code> instruction which we broke on back at the start of the article. You can see it’s adding the value of <code>uVar4</code> into the player’s score location. Scrolling up to [2], you see where <code>uVar4</code> is calculated, as the product of <code>iVar3</code> and <code>iVar6</code>. I bet one of those is the base score, and the other is the bonus multiplier. Going further up to [3], you’ll see <code>iVar3</code> does indeed seem to be derived from some global value. I bet that global is the current time, and these calculations are converting the internal time representation into points and maybe doing some rounding on the result. Looking around for more interesting stuff, the lines marked with [4] look a lot like bit flags. From the code flow, I bet that’s used for deciding which parts of the score calculation to display on screen when tallying the score.</p>



<p>So with some of those guesses, I used Ghidra to rename some of the local variables to be more descriptive. Here’s what I ended up with for everything that goes into calculating <code>uVar4</code> (I trimmed all the later stuff).</p>



<pre><code>  iVar2 = DAT_802f1f18;
  iVar4 = DAT_801eec4c;
  if ((param_1 &lt; 4) &amp;&amp; (1 &lt; param_1)) {
<strong><span>    score_multiplier = (int)DAT_801f3a7a; //[4]</span></strong>
    iVar5 = *(int *)(*(int *)(DAT_802f1f30 + 0xc) + 0x40);
    time_score = (DAT_801f3a74 * 100) / 0x3c + (DAT_801f3a74 * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    time_score = time_score - (time_score &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    out_flags = 0;
    exit_data = iVar5;

<h2 id="0-introduction">0. Introduction</h2>
<p>The x86 instruction set architecture is at the heart of CPUs that power our home computers and remote servers for over two decades. Being able to read and write code in low-level assembly language is a powerful skill to have. It enables you to write faster code, use machine features unavailable in C, and reverse-engineer compiled code.</p>
<p>But starting out can be a daunting task. The official documentation manuals from Intel are well over a thousand pages long. Twenty years of continual evolution with backward compatibility have produced a landscape with clashing design principles from different eras, deprecated features occupying space, layers upon layers of mode switches, and an exception to every pattern.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will help you gain a solid understanding of the x86 <abbr title="instruction set architecture">ISA</abbr> from basic principles. I will focus more on <em>building a clear mental model</em> of what’s happening, rather than giving every detail precisely (which would be long and boring to read). If you want to make use of this knowledge, you should simultaneously refer to another tutorial that shows you how to write and compile a simple function, and also have a list of CPU instructions open for referencing. My tutorial will start out in familiar territory and slowly add complexity in manageable steps – unlike other documentation that tend to lay out the information all at once.</p>
<p>The prerequisites to reading this tutorial are working with binary numbers, moderate experience programming in an imperative language (C/C++/Java/Python/etc.), and the concept of memory pointers (C/C++). You do not need to know how CPUs work internally or have prior exposure to assembly language.</p>

<p>When reading this tutorial, it’s helpful to write and test your own assembly language programs. This is most easily done on Linux (harder but possible on Windows). Here is a sample function in assembly language:</p>
<pre>.globl myfunc
myfunc:
    retl</pre>
<p>Save it in a file called my-asm.s, and compile it with the command: <tt>gcc -m32 -c -o my-asm.o my-asm.s</tt>. There is no way to run the code at the moment, because it would require either interfacing with a C program or writing boilerplate code for interacting with the <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> to handle the starting/printing/stopping/etc. At the very least, being able to compile code gives you a way to verify that your assembly programs are syntactically correct.</p>
<p>Note that my tutorial uses the AT&amp;T assembly language syntax instead of Intel syntax. The underlying concepts are still the same in both cases, but the notation is a bit different. It’s possible to mechanically translate from one syntax to the other, so there is no need for much concern.</p>

<h2 id="2-basic-execution-environment">2. Basic execution environment</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/cpu-model.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/cpu-model.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>An x86 CPU has eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. For historical reasons, the registers are named {<code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code>, <code>edx</code>, <code>ebx</code>, <code>esp</code>, <code>ebp</code>, <code>esi</code>, <code>edi</code>}. (Other CPU architectures would simply name them <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, ..., <code>r7</code>.) Each register can hold any 32-bit integer value. The x86 architecture actually has over a hundred registers, but we will only cover specific ones when needed.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, a CPU executes a list of instructions sequentially, one by one, in the order listed in the source code. Later on, we will see how the code path can go non-linearly, covering concepts like if-then, loops, and function calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/register-aliasing.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/register-aliasing.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>There are actually eight 16-bit and eight 8-bit registers that are subparts of the eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. These features come from the 16-bit era of x86 CPUs, but still have some occasional use in 32-bit mode. The 16-bit registers are named {<code>ax</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>, <code>bx</code>, <code>sp</code>, <code>bp</code>, <code>si</code>, <code>di</code>} and represent the bottom 16 bits of the corresponding 32-bit registers {<code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code>, ..., <code>edi</code>} (the prefix “e” stands for “extended”). The 8-bit registers are named {<code>al</code>, <code>cl</code>, <code>dl</code>, <code>bl</code>, <code>ah</code>, <code>ch</code>, <code>dh</code>, <code>bh</code>} and represent the low and high 8 bits of the registers {<code>ax</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>, <code>bx</code>}. Whenever the value of a 16-bit or 8-bit register is modified, the upper bits belonging to the full 32-bit register will remain unchanged.</p>

<h2 id="3-basic-arithmetic-instructions">3. Basic arithmetic instructions</h2>
<p>The most basic x86 arithmetic instructions operate on two 32-bit registers. The first operand acts as a source, and the second operand acts as both a source and destination. For example: <code>addl %ecx, %eax</code> – in C notation, this means: <code>eax = eax + ecx;</code>, where <code>eax</code> and <code>ecx</code> have the type <code>uint32_t</code>. Many instructions fit this important schema – for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>xorl %esi, %ebp</code> means <code>ebp = ebp ^ esi;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>subl %edx, %ebx</code> means <code>ebx = ebx - edx;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>andl %esp, %eax</code> means <code>eax = eax &amp; esp;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few arithmetic instructions take only one register as an argument, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>notl %eax</code> means <code>eax = ~eax;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>incl %ecx</code> means <code>ecx = ecx + 1;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bit shifting and rotation instructions take a 32-bit register for the value to be shifted, and the fixed 8-bit register <code>cl</code> for the shift count. For example: <code>shll %cl, %ebx</code> means <code>ebx = ebx &lt;&lt; cl;</code>.</p>
<p>Many arithmetic instructions can take an immediate value as the first operand. The immediate value is fixed (not variable), and is coded into the instruction itself. Immediate values are prefixed with <code>$</code>. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>movl $0xFF, %esi</code> means <code>esi = 0xFF;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>addl $-2, %edi</code> means <code>edi = edi + (-2);</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>shrl $3, %edx</code> means <code>edx = edx &gt;&gt; 3;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>movl</code> instruction copies the value from the first argument to the second argument (it does not strictly “move”, but this is the customary name). In the case of registers, like <code>movl %eax, %ebx</code>, this means to copy the value of the <code>eax</code> register into <code>ebx</code> (which overwrites <code>ebx</code>’s previous value).</p>

<h3>An aside</h3>
<p>Now is a good time to talk about one principle in assembly programming: Not every desirable operation is directly expressible in one instruction. In typical programming languages that most people use, many constructs are composable and adaptable to different situations, and arithmetic can be nested. In assembly language however, you can only write what the instruction set allows. To illustrate with examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>You can’t add two immediate constants together, even though you can in C. In assembly you’d either compute the value at compile time, or express it as a sequence of instructions.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can add two 32-bit registers in one instruction, but you can’t add three 32-bit registers – you’d need to break it up into two instructions.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can’t add a 16-bit register to a 32-bit register. You’d need to write one instruction to perform a 16-to-32-bit widening conversion, and another instruction to perform the addition.</p></li>
	<li><p>When performing bit shifting, the shift count must be either a hard-coded immediate value or the register <code>cl</code>. It cannot be any other register. If the shift count was in another register, then the value needs to be copied to <code>cl</code> first.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway messages are that you shouldn’t try to guess or invent syntaxes that don’t exist (such as <code>addl %eax, %ebx, %ecx</code>); also that if you can’t find a desired instruction in the long list of supported instructions then you need to manually implement it as a sequence of instructions (and possibly allocate some temporary registers to store intermediate values).</p>

<h2 id="4-flags-register-and-comparisons">4. Flags register and comparisons</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/eflags-register.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/eflags-register.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>There is a 32-bit register named <code>eflags</code> which is <em>implicitly</em> read or written in many instructions. In other words, its value plays a role in the instruction execution, but the register is not mentioned in the assembly code.</p>
<p>Arithmetic instructions such as <code>addl</code> usually update <code>eflags</code> based on the computed result. The instruction would set or clear flags like carry (CF), overflow (OF), sign (SF), parity (PF), zero (ZF), etc. Some instructions read the flags – for example <code>adcl</code> adds two numbers and uses the carry flag as a third operand: <code>adcl %ebx, %eax</code> means <code>eax = eax + ebx + cf;</code>. Some instructions set a register based on a flag – for example <code>setz %al</code> sets the 8-bit register <code>al</code> to 0 if ZF is clear or 1 if ZF is set. Some instructions directly affect a single flag bit, such as <code>cld</code> clearing the direction flag (DF).</p>
<p>Comparison instructions affect <code>eflags</code> without changing any general-purpose registers. For example, <code>cmpl %eax, %ebx</code> will compare the two registers’ value by subtracting them in an unnamed temporary place and set the flags according to the result, so that you can tell whether <code>eax &lt; ebx</code> or <code>eax == ebx</code> or <code>eax &gt; ebx</code> in either unsigned mode or signed mode. Similarly, <code>testl %eax, %ebx</code> computes <code>eax &amp; ebx</code> in a temporary place and sets the flags accordingly. Most of the time, the instruction after a comparison is a conditional jump (covered later).</p>
<p>So far, we know that some flag bits are related to arithmetic operations. Other flag bits are concerned with how the CPU behaves – such as whether to accept hardware interrupts, virtual 8086 mode, and other system management stuff that is mostly of concern to OS developers, not to application developers. For the most part, the <code>eflags</code> register is largely ignorable. The system flags are definitely ignorable, and the arithmetic flags can be forgotten except for comparisons and bigint arithmetic operations.</p>

<h2 id="5-memory-addressing-reading-writing">5. Memory addressing, reading, writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/ram-as-byte-array.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/ram-as-byte-array.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>The CPU by itself does not make a very useful computer. Having only 8 data registers severely limits what computations you can do because you can’t store much information. To augment the CPU, we have <abbr title="random access memory">RAM</abbr> as a large system memory. Basically, RAM is an enormous array of bytes – for example, 128 <abbr title="mebibytes">MiB</abbr> of RAM is 134&nbsp;217&nbsp;728 bytes that you can store any values to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/little-endian.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/little-endian.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>When storing a value longer than a byte, the value is encoded in little endian. For example if a 32-bit register contained the value 0xDEADBEEF and this register needs to be stored in memory starting at address 10, then the byte value 0xEF goes into RAM address 10, 0xBE into address 11, 0xAD into address 12, and finally …</p></article></div>

            <p><a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> has become the de facto solution for
managing X.509 certificates for applications running in Kubernetes. The project, <a href="https://www.jetstack.io/blog/cert-manager-cncf/">now part of the CNCF Sandbox</a>, was built with flexibility and extensibility in mind. It allows operators to use Certificates and Issuers as first-class citizens in the API, and for this to enable almost any use case in which an automated certificate is required.</p>
<p>As Kubernetes adoption grows, there is now increased interest in service mesh to securely connect workloads, as well as provide dynamic configuration of traffic routing and consistent observability. Services meshes typically use X.509 certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS), with the identity encoded using <a href="https://spiffe.io/">SPIFFE</a>.</p>
<p>With a range of supported certificate issuers, there has been interest from the community to see Istio integrated with cert-manager for it to provide signing capabilities for workloads. Working with the Security WG in the Istio community, as well as a number of our customers, the cert-manager team at Jetstack have built an integration that enables cert-manager to sign workload certificates in an Istio service mesh.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-service-mesh">Rise of the service mesh</h2>
<p><a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> is a popular, fully-featured service mesh; it has a rich set of configurations for traffic
routing, policy control, and observability. Like most service meshes, the data plane is powered by <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>, and each workload running in the mesh will have
one of these proxies that intercept all traffic, and make routing decisions
based upon the mesh configuration as a whole.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing certificates, service meshes typically ship with a limited number of Certificate
Authority (CA) choices, those being either self signed, perhaps
<a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a>, and sometimes an integration with a
cloud provider solution. This imposes limitations on <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> your certificates get signed. These limitations can
be problematic for larger enterprises where there are requirements for using
particular CAs, auditing and visibility of these signed certificates, as well as
the headaches that come with changing the Certificate Authority already used in
production.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-cert-manager">Why use cert-manager?</h2>
<p>cert-manager is commonly used to secure ingresses, in conjunction with an Ingress controller (NGINX, for example) and a public CA such as Let’s Encrypt. You can use cert-manager with Istio today to secure ingress using the Istio Gateway (<a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/certmanager/">guide</a>), but up until now it’s not been straightforward to use for issuance and renewal of <em>workload certificates</em>.</p>
<p>cert-manager was always built to be CA-agnostic and enable integration with both public <em>and</em> private CAs. The project and wider ecosystem has a wide choice of public and private CA providers available
for certificate signing. There are internal issuers core to the project, including HashiCorp Vault, and a fast-growing set of <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/">External Issuers</a> that should cover many bases, including cloud provider PKI services. It’s also simple enough to build on cert-manager and develop your own external issuer if you’ve a more bespoke requirement.</p>
<p>A further benefit of using cert-manager is its centralised API and consistent interface. This means that
swapping out an issuer, say to use a different CA provider, is fairly trivial. This operation only requires a change to the
<a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/">Issuer</a> configuration and issuer
that the mesh is configured to use - the rest is all handled by cert-manager.</p>
<p>By using cert-manager as the single tool for managing certificates in the
cluster, operators are able to have complete visibility of the machine identities with a single pane of glass,
for auditing, policy and observability purposes (and if that sounds useful, check out our
<a href="https://www.jetstack.io/jetstack-secure/">Jetstack Secure</a> service - it’s free to get started).</p>
<h2 id="machine-identity-lifecycle-in-an-istio-service-mesh">Machine identity lifecycle in an Istio service mesh</h2>
<p>When a workload starts, along with its sidecar, it needs to identify itself to
the mesh control plane, and retrieve a signed certificate in order to begin
sending traffic over the network. A helper executable called the <code>istio-agent</code> is
responsible for retrieving this signed certificate, and delivering it to Envoy to use.
This involves sending a certificate signing request to the control
plane component of Istio (<code>istiod</code>), along with the pod’s Service Account token
to securely identity itself. Once <code>istiod</code> has validated the request, it will in
the default case, sign and send back a certificate trusted by the mesh that
Envoy can begin to serve and send traffic.</p>
<h3 id="how-weve-integrated-cert-manager">How we’ve integrated cert-manager</h3>
<p>The cert-manager integration with Istio involves running a separate
component to <code>istiod</code>. The <code>cert-manager-istio-agent</code> processes certificate requests from istio-agents in the mesh.The agent will verify the identity, using the incoming Service Account token and ensure the
certificate signing request matches that identity, kicking off a
<code>CertiticateRequest</code> flow with cert-manager. This involves cert-manager watching
for the <code>CertiticateRequest</code> created, and signing it using the Issuer installed
and referenced on the request. Once signed, the certificate is returned back to
the <code>istio-agent</code> to facilitate mTLS in the mesh.</p>

  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6b47e30230d9fc89c785f8c98365e571c105d60a/351b2/blog/cert-manager-istio-integration/diagram.png" alt="cert-manager istio agent">
</figure>
<p>This agent is responsible for distributing the trust chain of the configured
Issuer, along with signing certificates for all workloads running in the
cluster.</p>
<p>Using the <code>istio-csr</code> project, you can integrate any of cert-manager’s Issuers and have this
provide certificate signing for workloads in the mesh. With more <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/">External
Issuers</a>, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/jetstack/google-cas-issuer">Google CAS Issuer</a>, being added
to the cert-manager ecosystem all the time, it allows certificates in all areas
of the cluster be signed from any number of centralised CAs that best suits
your needs, whilst ensuring the portability that the cert-manager API provides.</p>
<h4 id="not-using-istio">Not using Istio?</h4>
<p>In the CNCF, the <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd project</a> already provides <a href="https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/automatically-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/#cert-manager-as-an-on-cluster-ca">cert-manager integration</a>. Jetstack has also integrated Open Service Mesh (OSM), a new service mesh from Microsoft in the CNCF Sandbox - (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyddzt4oqLM&amp;list=PLeFOFE7BDgi0-VnLT8jPUWZF9m-zntrd_&amp;index=2&amp;utm_source=jetstack&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=community-day-videos">see this video</a> for a talk featuring a demo).</p>

Payload—a self-hosted Node, Express and React-based headless CMS, is now available.</h3></p></div><p>Hi—my name is James and I’m one of the founders of Payload CMS. After two years of development and thousands of commits, I am extremely excited to announce that Payload CMS is now available to the public. It’s our response to the surprisingly sparse JavaScript CMS market and we hope that its arrival improves the development workflow of engineers all over the world.</p><p>Payload has already been put through the test with an array of pilot projects that ranged from video game backend to full e-commerce store development, virtual event platform, and more. Through the projects we’ve released with Payload thus far, our own team’s efficiency has absolutely skyrocketed and we’re confident that it’s only going to get better from here.</p><h5>Now, we’re finally ready to open up to the community.</h5><p>We would greatly appreciate if you were to install Payload, give it a shot, and let us know what you think. Any type of feedback is welcome - be it about how we write our docs, about your experience using Payload in your projects, or anything else!</p><p id="we-needed-a-cms-that-didnt-exist"><h2>We needed a CMS that didn’t exist</h2></p><p>We built Payload because, over the years, my team and I have come to understand exactly what we need out of a CMS to build projects—big or small—for our clients:</p><p id="1-self-hosted"><h3>1. Self-hosted.</h3></p><p>What happens when your hosted CMS doesn’t offer you just that <em>one</em> thing that you need, so you need to end up opening a REST endpoint to build it? Guess it’s time to maintain your own server or Lambda function. Seems like a racket when you could have just used a self-hosted CMS in the first place and had a server set up already. We’ve been there too many times to let that keep happening.</p><p>Third-party hosted CMS might work for simple sites where you know you’ll be able to work within their confines for the lifetime of the app, or for strictly delivering content and not ever having to worry about receiving content, but when your needs become any more advanced, a self-hosted CMS that provides you with complete control is the way to go.</p><p>Security is also a concern with third-party hosted CMS solutions. <a href="https://trbl.design/">My digital design firm TRBL</a> works with many clients that are heavily security-focused and want to maintain complete control over their databases and infrastructure. Many of them deploy their CMS within their own private networks—only accessible via VPN or similar. For these clients, maintaining control over their own code is an absolute necessity, which removes many popular third-party hosted CMS from the equation.</p><p>Find out how to install Payload by <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation">heading to our Docs</a>.</p><p id="2-customizable-react-admin-panel"><h3>2. Customizable React admin panel.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS’ admin panel to be minimal, understandable, and most of all, <strong>completely customizable</strong>. If we need to customize a field type, we should be able to swap in our own React field component to take the place of a default text input, for example. We definitely don’t want to jump through any hoops, either, like dealing with messy iFrames or separately developed field type packages.</p><p>If we want to add a view, we should be able to build a React component and add it as a view. If we want to be able to customize the CMS’ branding, and completely white-label the CMS, we should be able to.</p><div><p><img src="https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png" alt="Payload headless CMS Admin UI built in React JS"></p><p>[Screenshot of the Payload Admin panel, editing a document from an Order collection]</p></div><p id="3-block-based-field-editor"><h3>3. Block-based field editor.</h3></p><p>My team and I design entire sites and apps with a component mentality—even down to how page layouts are assembled. Through UX design phases, we identify all the layout building “blocks” that are necessary to build and then we design our CMS to allow for content editors to self-craft their page layouts using the deliberately designed layout blocks that we’ve provided them with.  We then map each “block” in the CMS to React components that have props matching 1:1 to the fields within the CMS block. Boom, component-based layout building.</p><p>Like so many others, we started off years ago using WP and Advanced Custom Fields. ACF’s Flexible Content field type is great for layout building. But unfortunately, many other CMS have a complete lack of any layout-building workflow, and even when it’s supported, it lacks functionality or is a shoe-horned solution.</p><h5>Conditional Logic</h5><p>Another thing my team always took for granted in ACF that’s missing from other CMS completely is field-level conditional logic (show this field if another field has a value equal to <code>true</code> and similar). Our ideal CMS needs to have a built-in way to deliver dynamic interfaces that respond to input accordingly. Such a simple feature makes complex content management so much easier.</p><p id="4-javascript-top-to-bottom"><h3>4. JavaScript top to bottom.</h3></p><p>When’s the last time you worked on a web project without a <code>package.json</code>? Even if you work in PHP, you’re likely going to unavoidably need Node too. The idea of flattening our stack entirely into one language and not having to run a Docker container just to get a local LAMP environment going is a nice one indeed. We want to simplify our stack and keep it all JS. Better yet, TypeScript.</p><p id="5-reusable-secure-authentication"><h3>5. Reusable, secure authentication.</h3></p><p>One of the toughest parts about content management systems in-general is that they perform a lot of the lifting that a typical application framework would also need, but fall dramatically short of being able to call themselves an app framework through and through because of their lack of support for reusable authentication. For example, if you wanted to build a full SaaS product, you might need to create products, users, licenses, pages, and maybe even blog posts. Any run-of-the-mill CMS might get you close to being able to CRUD all of this stuff within its system, but what about user authentication? What about having control over users’ access? You’d be more often than not left to fend for yourself. Commonly you’d end up with either rolling your own system from scratch or building out a patchwork of separate systems (and separate admin UIs) to manage the product.</p><p>We need a CMS that comes with robust and reusable authentication right out of the box, so we can leverage the CMS for all our commonly needed authentication functionality. This way, we can keep all of our logic organized and build fully-featured apps right in our CMS that we’ve become accustomed to.</p><p>This way, if a client of ours comes to us asking for a simple app or a marketing site, but in the future, decides that they need to add full e-commerce support, we won’t end up with a messy disconnected set of admin UIs for them to manage their single product within. It can all be done in Payload.</p><h5>Payload's Authentication Operations</h5><p>In addition to just being able to log in and log out, Payload ships with everything a fully-featured app needs when it comes to authentication:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-registration</strong></li><li><strong>Login</strong></li><li><strong>Logout</strong></li><li><strong>Refresh token functionality</strong></li><li><strong>Forgot Password / Reset Password</strong></li><li><strong>Automatic locking of accounts on X number of failed password attempts</strong></li><li><strong>Email verification on new account creation</strong></li></ul><p>Payload supports as many authentication-ready collections as you need—meaning you could easily maintain a collection of Admins as well as a collection of Customers—each storing separate information and having separate access control to your documents.</p><h5>Payload's Access Control</h5><p>One of the best parts about Payload is its <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview">function-based Access Control</a>. Right in your configs, you define who can access what documents via extremely simple and straightforward Access Control functions.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example of an Orders collection with fine-tuned Access Control:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> Orders </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  access</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>create</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>read</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>          owner</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> equals</span><span>:</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>update</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>delete</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="6-uploads-with-local-storage"><h3>6. Uploads with local storage.</h3></p><p>Other existing CMS provide integrations to third-party file storage solutions, but those come with an additional cost, and one more third-party dependency to maintain. We want to be able to store our own file uploads, in our own contexts. If we want to ship them off to AWS S3 or similar after they’re uploaded locally—then so be it. They should be our files first though. And uploading should be simple to configure.</p><p id="7-code-based"><h3>7. Code-based.</h3></p><p>We used the ACF GUI for a while, but then realized we could be much more deliberate if we stored our ACF configs right in the PHP of our site. It was super nice to have written them, understood the code, and have them checked in directly to our repositories. Having our schemas so close to our code made referencing them significantly easier. Nowadays, we don’t find value from GUI schema designers and would rather just write them in code, pending the syntax is concise enough.</p><p id="8-maintain-your-own-express-server"><h3>8. Maintain your own Express server.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS with the right level of abstraction. That means giving us the functionality we know we won’t ever need to change, like auth and file upload, while also giving us the freedom to do what we need to do unhindered by a big lumbering framework whose docs are written for people that have Ph.Ds in Computer Science.  If we could keep our hands on our own Express server, then we could do whatever we need to do however we need to do it, outside of the CMS. Plus, if we could keep our own Express server, we could combine a CMS with a SSR framework like NextJS if we wanted to. One command, spin up Next and the CMS at once.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example for how Payload ties in to your existing Express server:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> payload </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'payload'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> express </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'express'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> app </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>express</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>payload</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  secret</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  mongoURL</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'mongodb://localhost/payload'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  express</span><span>:</span><span> app</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>PORT</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Application listening on </span><span>${</span><span>3000</span><span>}</span><span>...</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="9-localization-support"><h3>9.

Eventually, we may even become the go-to person on our team or in our organization, seen as the technical guru of our field.</p><p id="bd7c">At this level, we get a self-esteem boost, which is positive. But at times we may fall into the trap of getting an unnecessary ego. The wrong mindset creeps in, which can lead to the beginning of our downfall.</p><p id="8035">I’ve been through that journey. So I now consciously remind myself not to fall into one of those mindsets again. We’ll talk about three of them.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="fdb9">I once saw a tweet from a person who claimed his father (a programmer) offered to teach him how to code, and he rejected it. The author of the tweet is now a developer, describing himself as a self-taught programmer.</p><p id="e3c4">Programming isn’t a skill one can master completely by simply taking a course or getting a degree. A lot of sweat and time spent digging and learning is needed to build one’s competency.</p><p id="a45d">It’s not a field that can be effectively explored and fully discovered alone. We might not have a personal mentor and we may not have taken any formal courses, but that doesn’t change the fact that we still learn by reading from somewhere — whether that be a book, tutorial, blog, manual, or even Stack Overflow. All these things were written by someone.</p><p id="6607">In fact, the best way to learn programming is by working with a group of developers — through code reviews, pairings, constant discussion, and the exchange of ideas and the information learned. Attending conferences, guilds, dojos, etc. helps too.</p><p id="739c">Therefore, much of what we’ve learned and where we are today isn’t a result of our self-meditation on a mountain. Instead, it’s an accumulated assimilation of the knowledge and experience others have shared with us, either directly or indirectly.</p><p id="cc5a">We should always be grateful.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="0edf">Someone responded to one of my past blogs saying, “The young ones can’t concentrate. And their productivity is vastly lower than that of us oldsters. Their code quality is way lower.” I felt disgusted by this blanket statement targeting young programmers, even if I’m not the young one.</p><p id="c651">We learn, we grow, we age. With the advantage of time, we sometimes gain an upper hand in terms of both knowledge and experience in some area.</p><p id="10db">However, software development is an ever-changing field. One needs to continue learning to keep abreast of a skill. Over time, some of the past knowledge we acquired and spent time on is no longer relevant. When you consider what’s still relevant, the knowledge gap between older and younger programmers becomes smaller.</p><p id="15b7">At times, some area of knowledge younger programmers have might surpass us, the older folks (I consider myself an <em>older folk</em>, having worked for more than two decades). In software development, there’s been so much new knowledge to harvest in the last 10 years, and it’s not possible for us to extract it all.</p><p id="0b17">Never look down on the young ones. Respect each other, and always shamelessly ask and listen to their opinion. Be open. Avoid impostor syndrome. We might be surprised to learn a lot from those younger than us.</p><p id="28f9">The young ones are the future. They’ll shape the world one day. Teach them as much as you can, and also learn from them as much as you can. We’re not always right.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e916">“What more is there to learn within programming? Everything new is just an old thing with a different look — or it’s just <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>for</code> loops covered by fancier names and structures externally.” I thought this back then after I’ve mastered C++ and object-oriented programming.</p><p id="0a2f">I despised Java as an inferior language to C++ and looked down on all scripts — VBScript, JavaScript, and let’s not forget HTML, which isn’t even a language to me. Python, what is it? No <code>{}</code> and, it’s optional to use <code>;</code>? Using indentation is a must??</p><p id="f535">The word<em> evolve </em>meant nothing to me, and after a decade, Python became the most used language.</p><p id="1213">I still have the utmost respect for those with competency in C programming, having the ability to work with pointers, having proper memory management, and writing code that compiles into the smallest and most efficient executable.</p><p id="e21a">However, that’s no longer what mainstream software development looks like. Web programming took the world by storm in the ‘90s and early 2000s. Since the launch of the iPhone, mobile development has become a significant player in software development. And now artificial intelligence could be the next wave, which the Python language plays a significant role in enabling.</p><p id="11c4">Fast forward to today: Now I’m getting my feet wet in mobile development, a rapidly changing field. I just realized how wrong I was back then in despising the newer yet seemingly inferior product (i.e., Java) over what I’d mastered (i.e., C++). Java has influenced many of the programming languages we have today, and its JVM is the backbone of many new languages (e.g., Scala and Kotlin).</p><p id="97ef">Never despise newer tech at a glance. It’s true most of them spawn from an existing tech and may look similar (or at times even inferior), but all of these small little changes could contribute to the next leap of change.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="7126">In the early years of my career, I worked hard and was promoted fast. My boss jokingly gave me a little advice, “Don’t get cocky.” I guess that about sums it all up.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

</p>

<p>Because of the big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach">SolarWinds hack</a> and the recent blog post describing a new <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion attack</a>, there has been a lot of talk lately about supply chain attacks, the sneaky technique of compromising less secure elements in a supply chain to compromise more secure targets.</p>

<p>A popular target for supply chain attacks has always been the many package management systems for popular programming languages such as NPM for JavaScript, Rubygems for Ruby, and PyPI for Python. These systems have been plagued for years by malicious actors uploading malicious packages and waiting for victims to install them.</p>

<p>I haven’t heard much talk about how the situation looks for the Go ecosystem, and since Go is my new language of choice, I decided to do some investigation.</p>

<p>The novel <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion attack</a> vector is luckily not something a Go developer has to worry about since the source is always explicitly specified when importing a package, so when Go fetches the external dependency, it can’t be confused about where to fetch it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"github.com/stretchr/testify"</span>

<p>There is however still a possible attack vector via simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting">typosquatting</a> where the attacker exploits the fact that people often hit the wrong keys when typing on their keyboard. This could both be done on the host domain where the attacker registers a common typo of github.com, but even easier would be to simply register a new user on GitHub, or any other open package host, with a common typo of the package owner’s username.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I set out to build a tool that would help me uncover potential typosquat packages in the wild:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a large list of Go package import paths (e.g. <code>github.com/stretchr/testify</code>)</li>
  <li>Permutate the username of every unique package owner to get a list of potential typosquats</li>
  <li>Check if any of the typosquat users exists on the platform</li>
  <li>If a potential typosquat user is found, retrieve all of their repositories</li>
  <li>Log any of the repositories that have a name equal to the original packages being checked</li>
</ol>

<p>This resulted in a new tool I call <code>pkgtwist</code> which is <a href="https://gitlab.com/michenriksen/pkgtwist">available on GitLab</a> (the name is inspired by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist">dnstwist</a> tool)  if you are interested in doing your own evil Go package hunting.</p>

<h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2>

<p>Probably the most important part of <code>pkgtwist</code> was the generation of good username permutations in order to have the best chance of detecting typosquats. A bit of research led me to <a href="https://github.com/zntrio/typogenerator">zntrio/typogenerater</a> which looked like the perfect package for generating potential username typos. The package implements a pretty long list of permutation strategies that I picked a few from so that pkgtwist only spends time on checking what I feel are the most likely typosquats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Omission:</strong> removal of a single character (missing a keypress, <code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strechr</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> repetition of characters (pressing a key twice, <code>gobuffalo</code> =&gt; <code>gobuffallo</code>)</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitsquatting">Bitsquatting</a>:</strong> possible bit-flip errors (<code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strftchr</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Transposition:</strong> swapping of adjacent characters (pressing keys in the wrong order, <code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strethcr</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that if pkgtwist is given the package <code>github.com/stretchr/testify</code> as input, it will check if any of the of following users exist on GitHub, and if they do, check if they have also have a repository called <code>testify</code>:</p>

<p><code>tretchr</code> <code>sretchr</code> <code>stetchr</code> <code>strtchr</code> <code>strechr</code> <code>strethr</code> <code>stretcr</code> <code>stretch</code> <code>sstretchr</code> <code>sttretchr</code> <code>strretchr</code> <code>streetchr</code> <code>strettchr</code> <code>stretcchr</code> <code>stretchhr</code> <code>stretchrr</code> <code>rtretchr</code> <code>qtretchr</code> <code>ptretchr</code> <code>wtretchr</code> <code>vtretchr</code> <code>utretchr</code> <code>ttretchr</code> <code>suretchr</code> <code>svretchr</code> <code>swretchr</code> <code>spretchr</code> <code>sqretchr</code> <code>srretchr</code> <code>ssretchr</code> <code>stsetchr</code> <code>stpetchr</code> <code>stqetchr</code> <code>stvetchr</code> <code>stwetchr</code> <code>sttetchr</code> <code>stuetchr</code> <code>strdtchr</code> <code>strgtchr</code> <code>strftchr</code> <code>stratchr</code> <code>strctchr</code> <code>strbtchr</code> <code>streuchr</code> <code>strevchr</code> <code>strewchr</code> <code>strepchr</code> <code>streqchr</code> <code>strerchr</code> <code>streschr</code> <code>stretbhr</code> <code>stretahr</code> <code>stretghr</code> <code>stretfhr</code> <code>stretehr</code> <code>stretdhr</code> <code>stretcir</code> <code>stretcjr</code> <code>stretckr</code> <code>stretclr</code> <code>stretcmr</code> <code>stretcnr</code> <code>stretcor</code> <code>stretchs</code> <code>stretchp</code> <code>stretchq</code> <code>stretchv</code> <code>stretchw</code> <code>stretcht</code> <code>stretchu</code> <code>tsretchr</code> <code>srtetchr</code> <code>stertchr</code> <code>strtechr</code> <code>strecthr</code> <code>strethcr</code> <code>stretcrh</code></p>

<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>

<p>Next up was to find a list of packages to check. Initially, I thought about finding some sort of “Top X Go packages” list, but I couldn’t really find a good resource for that, so I ended up running pkgtwist against every github.com and gitlab.com hosted packages from the <a href="https://index.golang.org/index">Go Module Index</a> (731 packages in all).</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/pkgtwist_1.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/pkgtwist_1.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>pkgtwist running in verbose mode.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>After several hours of crunching through the 731 packages, pkgtwist finished with a list of 7 potential typosquat packages to investigate further. I honestly expected the list to be bigger, but I was of course happy to see that the Go ecosystem isn’t completely infested (yet) with malicious typosquat packages.</p>

<p>There were however a couple of typosquat packages that jumped out at me…</p>

<h3 id="githubcomsiruspenlogrus-️">github.com/siruspen/logrus ⚠️</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/">logrus</a> package by <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen">sirupsen</a> is a very popular logging package (17.3k stars on GitHub) that many Go projects use, which obviously makes it a target for a typosquat supply chain attack. So when I saw that the user <code>siruspen</code> (notice the letter swapping) had a similarly named repository, I quickly checked out what it was doing.</p>

<p>It turns out that the project is a fork of the original <code>logrus</code> repository, so doing a comparison to find the differences was pretty easy. At the time of writing, the only thing that is added to the potential typosquat repository, <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/compare/master...siruspen:master#diff-ff87b7c4777a35588053a509583d66c9f404ccbea9e1c71d2a5f224d7ad1323eR13-R16">is a small init function</a> with a single <code>Println</code> call:</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/siruspen_logrus.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/siruspen_logrus.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>Comparing siruspen/logrus with the original repository.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>While this is not malicious in any way it could very quickly be changed by the owner in the future, so I will definitely keep an eye on this repository. I would also recommend double-checking your projects if you use <code>logrus</code> to make sure you’re not using this package instead of the real one!</p>

<h3 id="githubcomutfavecli-️">github.com/utfave/cli ⚠️</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/urfave/cli">urfave/cli</a> is another popular Go package (15.4k stars on GitHub) for building CLI projects. So when I saw the user <code>utfave</code> also had a repository called <code>cli</code>, my alarm bells went off and I investigated further.</p>

<p>It turns out that the <a href="https://github.com/utfave/cli/commit/4af15496c49f613503d37d43b99df767f831bae1#diff-8d9ca23280f24fe6444d03ae46e7a15dd152170f32f57f978dfbdfd3cfe8ff55L26-R36">second-last commit</a> introduces a highly suspicious <code>init</code> function:</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/utfave_cli.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/utfave_cli.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>Ohai there, 122.51.124.140...</figcaption>
</div>

<p>It looks like the author <code>utfave</code> wants to know the hostname, operating system, and architecture of all the machines using their version of <code>urfave/cli</code>. The function extracts the system information and then calls out to the IP address <code>122.51.124.140</code> belonging to the Chinese company Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems via HTTP with the system information added as URL parameters.</p>

<p>While this code won’t give them any access to systems, it’s highly suspicious that they collect this information and the actor can quickly change this code to call back with a reverse shell if they identify a system to be valuable or interesting.</p>

<p>I reported this repository to GitHub and hope to see it taken down in the near future. Until then, I recommend double-checking your projects if you use the <code>urfave/cli</code> to make sure you’re not using the typosquatted version.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While my little research project didn’t cover every single Go package out there, I feel it covered enough to give a rough picture of what the supply chain attack situation looks like for the Go ecosystem. The two repositories <code>siruspen/logrus</code> and <code>utfave/cli</code>, were the only ones out of the 7 flagged repos that really worried me, but I will keep a close eye on the rest as they could in theory become malicious at any time.</p>

<p>I think Go is in a better situation than other programming languages because the source of packages is always explicitly written every time they are used, but code editor automation could make typosquat attacks more likely to happen as the developer doesn’t write the import paths manually as often. As an example, if the popular <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go">Go extension</a> for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is installed, a developer will typically only type a package import on the first usage, and then the editor will automatically add the import in any other files as soon as the package name is used. If the developer mistypes the import path the first time, a malicious package could be introduced and live for a long time in a Go project before it’s discovered.</p>

<p>In this article, we set up <em>limiters</em> in order to equitably distribute the bandwidth of our Internet connection among all the users of our local network.</p>



<h2>What are <em>Limiters</em>?</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a purpose.<br>A limiter can be used to limit traffic to a specific IP address or subnet, to limit traffic for a specific type of service (e.g. e-mail, web, …) or to distribute traffic equitably among several users.</p>



<p>Typical uses of limiters are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>limit the Internet bandwidth of user X to 1 Mbps ;</li><li>distribute equitably 10 Mbps of bandwidth between all the users of the “LAN” network;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the “OPT” network to a total of 5 Mbps;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the FTP protocol to 2 Mbps.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a usage</strong>.<br>At the opposite, traffic shaping (like CBQ) allows to guarantee a minimum bandwidth.</p>



<h2>How limiters work?</h2>



<p>The implementation of the limiters is done in 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>creating <strong>limiter</strong> itself: it’s a pipe with a maximum bandwidth which operates globally or by group of IP addresses;</li><li>creating assignment <strong>rules</strong>: which traffic will be limited by which pipe.</li></ul>



<p>Limiters are usually created in pairs: one limiter for incoming traffic (Download) and one limiter for outgoing traffic (Upload).</p>



<p>Limiters are organized hierarchically: a root limiter (also called a pipe), with a bandwidth and a latency, and on the other hand child limiters (called queues) with a weight (i.e. a priority).</p>



<h2>Use case: distribute Internet bandwidth equitably</h2>



<p>In this article we work with the following case study: we have an Internet connection with a download speed of 200 Mbps and an upload speed of 50 Mbps.<br>We want to share dynamically this bandwidth between all users.</p>



<p>If we have 2 users connected at the same time, they will each have 100 Mbps for download and 25 Mbps for upload at the maximum.<br>If we have 10 users connected at the same time, they will each have 20 Mbps for download and 5 Mbps for upload at the maximum.</p>



<p>pfSense will manage this equitable distribution automatically and dynamically as we go.</p>



<p>The network diagram is as follows:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="501" height="718" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png 501w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"><figcaption>Network diagram</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start the configuration!</p>



<h2>1. Create the upload <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We create 2 root limiters: one for upload and one for download.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="156" height="238" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-traffic-shaper-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the <strong>Limiters</strong> tab, click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the pipe and its queues.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the pipe (alphanumeric characters and underscore only). In our case, we call it “<strong>Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: the bandwidth of the pipe. Note that we can define a bandwidth according to a schedule (“Schedule” option). In our case, we choose “50 Mbps”.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: this parameter allows to define how the limitation will be applied to the traffic. 3 choices are available:<ul><li><span>none</span>: the limitation will apply to all traffic as a single set. In our case, this is what we choose (we want the whole outgoing traffic to be limited to 50 Mbps).</li><li><span>Source addresses</span>: the limitation will apply per source IP address (or group of source IP addresses, depending on the mask). So, to perform a limitation by IP address of a network, we choose “Source addresses” and specify a /32 mask. This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Upload pipe.</li><li><span>Destination addresses</span>: the limitation will apply by destination IP address (or group of destination IP addresses, depending on the mask). This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Download pipe.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: allows to set advanced parameters such as latency or packet loss rate. These parameters are useful to simulate bad Internet connections (or to make a bad joke to a colleague…). We won’t use it in our case, but the name of each field speaks for itself.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="963" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x295.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x755.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point we have a pipe that will allow us to limit our traffic to a maximum bandwidth of 50 Mbps.</p>



<p>The next step is to create a queue linked to this pipe and specify that this queue will be applicable per user.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the page of the limiter we just created, we click on the “+ Add new Queue” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the queue.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the queue. In our case, we call it “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: the mask to be applied. In our case, we choose “Source addresses”. We want to apply this limitation for each user, i.e. per source IP address, so we choose “32” as mask size.</li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: weight ranging from 1 (lowest priority) to 100 (highest priority). For a fair distribution of the bandwidth of the root limiter, this field can be left empty. If we want to give more bandwidth to some users than to others, then we have to play with this value. In our case, we leave the field empty (the distribution will be fair between users).</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: we leave these fields empty.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="802" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x246.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x629.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our limiters (pipe and queue) are ready for outgoing (upload) traffic.</p>



<p>We still have to do the same configuration for incoming (download) traffic.</p>



<h2>2. Create the download <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The pipe configuration is the same as for the upload pipe.<br>You just have to think about choosing the right bandwidth (in our case, 200 Mbps) and changing its name (in our case, we call it “Download”).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="910" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 977w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x279.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x715.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As for the upload pipe, we create a queue: click on the button “+ Add new Queue”.</p>



<p>The configuration is almost the same as for the upload queue.<br>The difference is in the choice for the “Mask” option. Choose “Destination addresses”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="798" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x245.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The limiters are created:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="146" height="123" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiters-list-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Limiters tree</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>3. Modify firewall rules</h2>



<p>The last step is to configure the firewall to associate traffic with limiters.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Rules:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="241" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Choose the LAN tab and edit each filtering rule for Internet access.</p>



<p>On each rule, go to the advanced options (“Display Advanced” button):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="244" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png 405w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Advanced Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the bottom of the page, for the “In / Out pipe” option, choose “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>” for the first drop-down list and “<strong>LAN_Download</strong>” for the second:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="126" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png 791w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-300x48.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-768x122.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"><figcaption>[pfSense] In / Out pipe (limiters)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is necessary to perform this manipulation on all the rules concerned.</p>



<p>The traffic limitation per user is in place!</p>



<h2>4. Check the service</h2>



<p>To check that the limiters are working properly, navigate to Diagnostics &gt; Limiter Info.<br>Each pipe and its queues is presented in text format with its parameters and values.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-03-01</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2021-03-02</span>.</p>
<p>Are you a JavaScript framework or library fan-boy? One of those frontend developers who cannot figure out how to build a website without completely smothering and drowning everything in JavaScript? Well, if you are, let me share a JavaScript nightmare with you!</p>

<p>These last couple of days I have been working for a company that contacted me because they where suffering from some "hacking" problems on their website. The company is run by two hardworking entrepreneurs, who know a lot about how to run a successful business, but close to nothing about computer related security.</p>

<p>These guys naturally trusted their entire IT infrastructure to a couple of external IT companies and they also used a couple of one-man freelance developers for different smaller tasks.</p>

<p>It is a real shame, but I must admit that I am not surprised at my findings. None of these IT companies or one-man freelance developers had the least knowledge about security. What they did is just about what everyone else is doing these days - blindly following hype and trends!</p>

<p><img src="http://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/blind-following.jpg" alt="Drawing of people blindly following other people"><br><strong>Monkey see, monkey do - blind following</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to skip ahead because the complexity of the problems are almost too difficult to describe, but let's just say that everything is a mess! From how the computers at the office are being used, to the implemented password policy, to lacking firewall implementations, to yes, just about everything is a problem. However, despite multiple possible attack vectors can you guess where the attackers actually have chosen to focus their payload?</p>

<p><b>JavaScript obfuscated malware</b>.</p>

<p>I would have expected that the websites would be infested with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">web shells</a>, SPAM bots, cross site scripting, and all the other "good stuff", but no.</p>

<p>The company has more than one website, but all are of those kinds that are drowning in unneeded JavaScript from head to toe. Absolutely nothing works on these websites without all of this JavaScript crap - yet, absolutely nothing of what the JavaScript is doing is truly needed or even useful!</p>

<p>As I was going through the code, trying very hard to figure out what was going on in this JavaScript nightmare, I eventually had to give up. It would literally take weeks, if not months to de-obfuscate everything and figure out what was legitimate usage and what was malware.</p>

<p>And that's typical of todays web developers. I cannot count the number of sites I have seen that is filled with utterly useless JavaScript functionality.</p>

<p><strong>And I'm sick of it!</strong></p>

<p>If you're a frontend developer reading this, and you're a JavaScript fan-boy, <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">Stop pushing JavaScript!</a></p>

<p>As a frontend developer you're responsible for your client and their customers. Your stupid JavaScript is a prime target for inserting obfuscated malware so you better make sure it is truly needed, and you better make sure that it is easy to validate!</p>

<p><strong>We don't need JavaScript for the majority of websites on the Internet! It's causing much more harm than good!</strong></p>

<p>For everyone who isn't a frontend developer: Make sure you run your browser in a secure jail, disable JavaScript in your browser or use something like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> and boycott websites that has made their basic functionality dependent on JavaScript - you're seriously in risk of getting infected with malware just by visiting a website unless you take your precautions. And no, anti-virus software isn't going to help you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>MasterPlan is an idea board and project manager.&nbsp; It has the ability to create objects&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul><li>To-do lists</li><li>Timers</li><li>Images, GIFs, and Sounds</li><li>Deadlines</li><li>and Maps...</li></ul>
<p>... on a freeform grid, allowing you to <strong>plan&nbsp;projects out</strong>. You can use MasterPlan&nbsp;your way, whether as a moodboard for&nbsp;art, or as a productivity planner for your next big&nbsp;video game.</p>
<p>You can tweak how it looks to your liking, with themes and different visual&nbsp;options.&nbsp;The goal is to make it easy to plan out ideas, and to give you flexibility while doing so.</p>
<p>MasterPlan is currently in early access, and is receiving regular, steady updates that improve the functionality and usability of the program. These updates are <strong>lifetime</strong> updates and&nbsp;will remain free of charge for those who purchase MasterPlan. The cost of MasterPlan may rise as it becomes more and more feature-complete, naturally.</p>
<p>Note that the&nbsp;free demo of MasterPlan showcases its full functionality, but lacks the ability to save projects.</p>
<h4>How is it?</h4>
<p>Good!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER! MasterPlan is currently in its early access phase, and will receive&nbsp;updates regularly over time improving the stability of the program. I would recommend saving often and using it with a version control system to make it possible to roll back your plan in case of mistakes.</strong></p>
<p>Also note that only 64-bit builds are available currently; if there is a demand for 32-bit builds, please let me know and I'll see if I can get an easy way&nbsp;to build them.&nbsp;If you're feeling hacky or frugal, the complete source code for MasterPlan is available for perusal, building, and contribution on its GitHub repository&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br></p>
<h3>Steam?</h3>
<p>MasterPlan is now available on&nbsp;Steam, as well. If you purchase MasterPlan here,&nbsp;you will also be&nbsp;entitled to a free Steam key, accessible from the project download page.</p>
<p>____</p>
<p><strong>Recommended system requirements</strong></p>
<ul><li>Recent 64-bit&nbsp;versions of Windows (&gt;= 7), Mac&nbsp;(&gt;= 10.14), or Linux&nbsp;(&gt;= Ubuntu 18.04)</li><li>OpenGL 3.3-capable graphics card</li><li>A&nbsp;sound card</li><li>For clipboard support on&nbsp;Linux, a clipboard tool needs to be installed (any of xsel, xclip, or wl-clipboard). For file manager support on Linux, a file manager needs to be installed (any of&nbsp;zenity, qarma, or matedialog)</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A not so classic Chip8 emulator]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I always found emulators amazing pieces of software. The first I used was a SNES one, that I use to play some classic games I never was able to get when I was a kid. I thought those <em>beasts</em> were <em>black magic</em>, something I will never be able to grasp.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>I basically wanted to improve my OpenGL (and C++) skills through a fun project.
I always wanted to make an emulator, and the Chip8 is a fairly easy one to
start with. So why not making the rendering 3D to be able to move “inside”
the game.</p><p>Here is a small video of what it looks like:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3pDNioWFzI">youtube</a></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWF4xeW.gif" alt="video"></p><h2>About Chip8</h2><p>The Chip 8 is actually a virtual machine developed in the 70s by Joseph Weisbecker. So it was never a real console to begin with but we still can emulate it. There have been plenty of games written for it so we can run them later in our emulator.</p><p>This is probably the easiest emulator you can start with, since it has a very small number of opcodes and they are pretty simple to implement. You can find easily on the internet the specifications needed to be implemented. For instance on this <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM">website</a>.</p><p><img src="https://api.jeromem.dev/uploads/chip8_2_b4be3fe963.png" alt="chip8-2.png"></p><h2>C++ data modeling</h2><pre><code><span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Cpu</span><span>
</span></span><span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    </span><span>uint16_t</span><span> opcode;
</span></span><span>    Memory &amp; memory;
</span><span><span>    </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>, 16&gt; registers;

</span></span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>So as we can see that machine is very simple. We've got 4Kb memory to work with, 16 registers and then some variables where we are storing the current opcode, the current index and the value of the program counter (pc).  There is two timers that are clocked at 60Hz. Each one of them should be decremented 60 times per second. If the <code>timerSound</code> is above 0, we should play a sound.</p><p>If you are interested in knowing more about it, you should check this <a href="https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/">guide</a> which explains a lot more things than me.</p><h2>Rendering</h2><p>Usually the games are rendered in a <code>64 * 32</code> framebuffer. To make mine a bit different from the others I decided to treat each pixels as a <em>cube</em>. Each single pixel is treated as an entity to be drawn, this is definitively not the most efficient way of doing it, but for such a small number of pixels it went well with an average of 200 fps on a machine without a dedicated graphic card.</p><p><img src="https://api.jeromem.dev/uploads/chip8_1_a9afb7f689.png" alt="chip8-1.png"></p><p>The 3D engine is a simple basic <strong>OpenGL</strong> renderer with a few shaders for the shadows and lights and a very basic <em>free fly camera</em>. The most important part is to render those array of pixels into cubes and translating it into 3D using matrices.</p><pre><code><span><span>auto</span><span> view = camera.getViewMatrix();
</span></span><span><span></span><span>auto</span><span> projection = glm::perspective(camera.getZoom(), </span><span>2.0f</span><span>, </span><span>0.1f</span><span>, </span><span>500.0f</span><span>);
</span></span><span><span></span><span>auto</span><span> cameraPosition = camera.getPosition();

            <p>The if-statement is a very basic thing, not just in bash, but in all of programming.
I see them used quite a lot in shell scripts,
even though in many cases they can be replaced with something much more elegant.</p>
<p>In this rather short article, I'll show how control operators can be used
instead.
Many probably know about this, but don't realize how to use them nicely.
This will help you write cleaner shell scripts in the future.</p>
<p>Here is what a simple if-statements looks like in bash:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]
</span><span>then
    </span><span>command
</span><span>fi

</span><span># or
</span><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]; then </span><span>command</span><span>; fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ughh. Let's improve!</p>
<h2 id="control-operators">Control operators
    <a href="#control-operators" aria-label="Anchor link for: control-operators">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Bash provides <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Definitions.html#Definitions">control operators</a> to build sequences of
commands.
Some of these are conditional and allow logical branching based on the success
state of the last run command.</p>
<p>We will just focus on these two logical operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code>: the AND operator, run the following command only if previous succeeded</li>
<li><code>||</code>: the OR operator, run the following command only if previous failed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exit-codes">Exit codes
    <a href="#exit-codes" aria-label="Anchor link for: exit-codes">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>You might wonder how bash considers whether a command succeeded.
This is where <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status">exit codes</a> come in.
When a program exits a numeric status code is returned.
A value of <code>0</code> means the program succeeded, any other value means it failed.</p>
<p>The exit code is normally hidden.
The status of the last run command is stored in the <code>?</code> variable.
You may inspect it by invoking:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span><span>$</span><span>?
</span></code></pre>
<p>E.g., listing with <code>ls</code> normally returns <code>0</code>, but this value differs if the
directory doesn't exist or if an error occurred.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>ls ~</span><span>/            </span><span># exit code: 0
</span><span>ls </span><span>~</span><span>/nonexistent </span><span># exit code: 2
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will function similarly to almost any program.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-commands">Chaining commands
    <a href="#chaining-commands" aria-label="Anchor link for: chaining-commands">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Let's go over some examples to show how these control operators can be used.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Source_command">source</a> the <code>~/.profile</code> file, but only if it
is readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>]</span><span>; then
    </span><span>source </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span><span>fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can simplify this using control operators:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>. </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>Only if the readability check expression is truthful/succeeds, we want to source
the file, so we use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.</p>

<p>To require invoking user to be root, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command exists with <code>0</code>, so this propagates to <code>exit</code> if the
first expression is truthful.</p>

<p>If we'd like to print our profile file contents with a success message,
or an error message on reading failure, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cat ~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> This is your profile </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Failed to read profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can make these command sequences as long as you want. Useful for
building install scripts that go through a series of steps. You could define
bash functions for each step and orchestrate the installation like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>cleanup </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or format it differently to make long sequences better readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>cleanup </span><span>||
  </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre><h2 id="nice-to-know">Nice to know
    <a href="#nice-to-know" aria-label="Anchor link for: nice-to-know">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>There are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/159514/61092">many</a> more control operators,
including list terminators, pipe operators, and others.</p>
<p>The <code>[</code> (commonly used in if-statements) isn't just a shell feature.
It is a binary on Unix-like systems, usually located at <code>/usr/bin/[</code>,
so it can be used anywhere.
It returns the exit code <code>0</code> if the expression was truthful.</p>
<p>You can chain multiple <code>[ expr ] &amp;&amp; [ expr ]</code> expressions together, they are
commands after all.</p>
<p>Bash also has <code>[[</code>, which is
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13542832/1000145">different</a> from <code>[</code>.</p>
<p>You can wrap multiple commands with <code>{ expr }</code> to run it as single expression in
your command chain. For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>{ </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root</span><span>; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1 }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands do nothing more than returning <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Bash features <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion">parameter expression</a>.
You can use <code>${EDITOR:=nvim}</code> to set the <code>EDITOR</code> variable to <code>nvim</code> only if
it is empty, so you won't even need conditionals.</p>
<p>Most other shells support similar operators. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> uses <code>; and</code> and <code>; or</code>, but now <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4620">supports</a> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> as well in modern versions.</p>
<p><code>$_</code> (or <code>Alt+.</code>) is your last used argument (noted by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lobste.rs/s/nao13f/elegant_bash_conditionals#c_brp038">@Diti</a>).
For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>test</span><span> -f </span><span>"</span><span>FILE</span><span>" </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>source </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span>" </span><span>|| </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span> does not exist</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&amp;</span><span>2
</span></code></pre>
<p>A function or script returns the exit code of the last expression. If your last
expression is a command chain as described in this article, you might have an
unexpected exit code. See
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lw0ofg/elegant_bash_conditionals/gpf1lr0/">this</a>
comments.</p>

</h2>
<p>These command sequences with control operators are an elegant alternative for
simple if-statements. I think they look much better and are more expressive
looking at conditional logic.</p>
<p>But, don't overuse them. For bigger statements or advanced branching, you should
fall back to if-statements.</p>
<p>I hope this article motivates you to make your shell scripts a little more
elegant in the future by using these operators.</p>

Tom Muench, a city councillor in Richmond Hill, Ont., just north of Toronto, said newspapers are critical to&nbsp;the functioning of a healthy democracy, so it gives him pause that such a prominent newspaper chain may be financially beholden to an outside business to keep its doors open.</p>  <p>"I think it's fair to say that if a casino was to pop up in communities say six&nbsp;months ago, many local Torstar-owned papers&nbsp;would write a concerned local story," he told CBC News in an email.</p>  <p>He also wonders how those same newspapers would report on it, if any other sort of business were to open an online gambling operation on the side.</p>  <p>"If the federal government propped up the media with government tax dollars and now with casinos, how do we assure a strong independent news and media industry?"&nbsp;</p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {

                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));

<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>

"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",

<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was opening multiple shells for an unrelated project today and noticed how abysmal my shell load speed was. After the initial load it was relatively fast, but the actual shell start up was noticeably slow. I timed it with <code>time</code> and these were the results.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Original zsh profile" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.png"></picture><p>You can time your own shell with:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq </span>1 10<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> /usr/bin/time <span>$SHELL</span> <span>-i</span> <span>-c</span> <span>exit</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Raw <code>bash</code>, as a comparison, was blazing fast - it averaged 0.03 seconds, with about 0.02 in user-land and 0.01 in kernel. This is with an empty <code>.bashrc</code> and other dotfiles, so it would prove to be a lower bound/goal.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Raw bash speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.png"></picture><p>I was averaging 3.14 seconds, with 1.64 in user-land and 1.5 in kernel-land.</p><p>My zsh set up was nearly 100x slower than raw bash. I wanted to investigate what was going on, and why it was so much slower.</p><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3><p>Before we begin, it might be helpful to understand how shells in general start up. Shells are just an executable like any other on your machine - their purpose is to just take user input and behave like an old terminal. They have predefined control sequences, but in general are fairly extensible. The following is from ZSH man pages:</p><blockquote><p>Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden. … Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOT-DIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then /etc/zlogout are read.</p></blockquote><p>The following files are read:</p><div><div><pre><code>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
${TMPPREFIX}*   (default is /tmp/zsh*)
/etc/zshenv
/etc/zprofile
/etc/zshrc
/etc/zlogin
/etc/zlogout    (installation-specific - /etc is the default)
</code></pre></div></div><p>This gives a general flow of execution, and where zsh starts. My <code>.zshrc</code> leads to <code>source</code>ing a few other files, which just behaves as if the contents of those files was passed directly into the shell as standard input.</p><h3 id="profiling">Profiling</h3><p>We can start by profiling raw <code>zsh</code> - it’s even faster than raw bash.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Raw zsh speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.png"></picture><p>The first step is to figure out exactly what’s taking so long - there are a variety of tools to measure performance, but the most useful will be <code>zsh</code>’s native debug tools.</p><p>This enables <code>xtrace</code>ing and <code>verbose</code> output. It’s not particularly great for time analysis, though - it does not include timestamps, so we have to eyeball the speed. It’s easy to catch a few immediate culprits - for instance, mine hung for at least a second on loading <code>nvm</code>. Anything that is a few orders of magnitude slower than the other commands will stick out like a sore thumb.</p><p>The second is an order-blind profiler - at the top of <code>.zshrc</code>, insert <code>zmodload zsh/zprof</code>. This will enable the built in profiling.</p><p>At the end of <code>.zshrc</code> insert <code>zprof</code>.</p><p>The output will look as follows:</p><div><div><pre><code>num  calls                time                       self            name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ...
</code></pre></div></div><p>This will tell us exactly where <code>zsh</code> is spending most of it’s time.</p><h3 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem</h3><p>I started by playing around with high-level entry points. For instance, disabling <code>source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh</code> from my <code>~/.zshrc</code> cut my load time down by half, to roughly 1.7 seconds average. I then disabled <code>nvm</code> and my times plummeted. I had found the main two culprits of slow load times.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Zsh speeds with no Oh my zsh or nvm" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.png"></picture><p>My new average had become only 40 milliseconds. I didn’t want to lose the functionality that oh-my-zsh provided, however, so I looked into improving it.</p><p>I started profiling specific subsections of oh-my-zsh like so:</p><div><div><pre><code><span># I use gdate from brew's core-utils because macOS date does not support nanoseconds</span>
<span>timer</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$(</span>gdate +%s%N<span>)</span><span>/</span><span>1000000</span><span>))</span> 

<span># Original .zshrc/config file</span>

<span>now</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$(</span>gdate +%s%N<span>)</span><span>/</span><span>1000000</span><span>))</span>
<span>elapsed</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$now</span><span>-</span><span>$timer</span><span>))</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$elapsed</span><span>":"</span> <span>$plugin</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I wrapped all the plugin loading and sourcing, and profiled each one.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Profile functions" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.png"></picture><p>The plugin <code>command-not-found</code> was the main slow down of <code>Oh-My-Zsh</code>. I went through and disabled the plugins I didn’t use much and got my shell load time down.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Post changes to startup" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.png"></picture><p>My new shell start time was about half a second. <code>Oh-My-Zsh</code> still took up the majority of it, but I believe it to be a valuable addition. I do wish it put a bit more of an emphasis on performance, however.</p><p>The last thing to do is to lazy load functions and services that I don’t need. I found a <a href="https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great sandbox lazyloader here</a> that was useful for nvm/rvm. Any command invocation of nvm from terminal, script, or otherwise still succeeds, it just gets lazy loaded the first time it’s invoked.</p><h3 id="observations">Observations</h3><p>Oh-My-Zsh is great and provides a lot of functionality, but it comes at a fairly heavy cost. As you can see above, it’s overhead accounts for nearly 70% of my load time.</p><p>There is one other thing of note - <code>oh-my-zshzsh</code> provides a built in function, <code>vcs_info</code>, to provide information about the the version control status of the current working directory. However, this is quite slow! For the actual Zsh git repo, it takes about <em>200ms</em> to parse. In large projects with a heavy git history this will hang your prompt return time for seconds. This won’t necessarily impact shell start time, but it will impact the amount of time it takes to actually display the prompt when navigating within a VCS-belonging directory. This can be slightly fixed with <code>git config oh-my-zsh.hide-status 1</code> on problematic repos, but it would be nice if it did so automatically. Setting the option <code>DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"</code> in your <code>.zshrc</code> can help as well, but comes with a loss of functionality.</p><p>Finally, a lot of time is spent in <code>compinit</code> and <code>compdef</code>. These are functions that create/define entries in the local completions cache (the <code>~/.zcompdump-machinename</code> file you might’ve noticed). There are a few hacks floating around GitHub, HackerNews, and various forums that try to remedy this (only check once a day, only check on new shell logins, etc), but none are particularly robust/without side effects.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>In the future I hope to actually recompile zsh with additional profiling techniques and debug information - keeping an internal timer and having a flag output current time for each command in a tree fashion would make building heat maps really easy.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Final zsh speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.png"></picture><p>I ended with zsh taking about 0.42 seconds, or 420 milliseconds, to start up. Disabling Oh-My-Zsh gets the average down further to roughly 50ms. For now the extra 380 or so milliseconds are worth it, but I might be tempted to try another framework if I can’t get it any faster.</p><h3 id="final-note">Final Note</h3><p>While initial start time can (and should) be optimized, it pales in comparison to the importance of <em>prompt</em> return time.</p><p>In a typical workflow you’re returning to your prompt hundreds of times more than you’re actually starting new shell sessions. I’d like to profile prompt time much more, as I’ve noticed that even a 10% gain is noticeable (and much more important, as waiting any longer than half a second for a prompt will quickly become infuriating). As mentioned above, my largest culprit for prompt return time was <code>vcs_info</code> - I mostly work out of directories that have a git repo attached, and it’s very noticeable there.</p><h4 id="resources">Resources</h4><p>Here are a few resources I consulted while working on this post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284</a></li><li><a href="https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://wpsuperheroes.com/slow-osx-terminal-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wpsuperheroes.com/slow-osx-terminal-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://bennycwong.github.io/post/speeding-up-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bennycwong.github.io/post/speeding-up-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6056</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.peiyingchi.com/2017/08/17/speed-up-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.peiyingchi.com/2017/08/17/speed-up-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/236953/zsh-starts-incredibly-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://superuser.com/questions/236953/zsh-starts-incredibly-slowly</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.patshead.com/2011/04/improve-your-oh-my-zsh-startup-time-maybe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.patshead.com/2011/04/improve-your-oh-my-zsh-startup-time-maybe.html</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd</a></li></ul><p>Additionally, the specific dot files that I used above, in their original state, can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonluca/dotfiles/tree/551234df4d4527d6990ae3ea681bf015da8a0570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2019-07-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2019-09-19</span>.</p>
<p>Frontend developers are pushing JavaScript as though the web could not function without it. The fact is that JavaScript is one of the top reasons for security breaches on the client computer and client mobile phones, it is a plague that turns privacy into a public exhibition, and it has paralyzed the industry in such a way that you can hardly find a website that doesn't display "the white screen of death" if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it straight out: Frontend developers are breaking the Internet! They have been stricken with some kind of mass psychosis in which even the least amount of independent thinking has become so hard that you think you're dealing with a zombie. It doesn't even qualify as a form of blind following, because nobody is leading. It rather looks like everyone is running around frenzied.</p>
<p>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</p>
<p>I have worked as both backend and frontend developer since 1998 and I have never once made a web application depend upon JavaScript. This goes for web shops, blog systems, large CMS installations, as well as Intranet administration utilities, and much more. In situations where I have been hired as a consultant to an existing team, the first thing I have done was to remove any dependency on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Not once has a client ever experienced a problem with his web application as a result, rather on the contrary. Removing JavaScript makes the application load much faster, removes multiple security related attack vectors, and greatly improves customer privacy concerns and usability.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing you can simulate much of the improved UI experience that JavaScript can provide using only backend technology. The much improved performance, security, and privacy far exceed whatever loss of JavaScript capabilities you might experience.</p>
<p>The problem resides with websites that by nature doesn't require any form of JavaScript in order to serve the content they are serving. And the fact of the matter is that the majority of frontend developers aren't developing applications for niche markets with specific JavaScript requirements, rather they are developing regular websites, applications that in the end are just plain simple HTML. You do remember what plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> is right?</p>
<p>Even most niche products that in nature perhaps do require some amount of JavaScript could often still be somewhat useful had they at least been build <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opt_in">opt-in</a> rather than not function at all.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever seen how a blind person uses the Internet? If not you need to have this demonstrated! Especially if you're a frontend developer. You might think that blind people who use the Internet are a minority, but the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter how many people with disabilities use the Internet, the Internet is for everybody, and when websites are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. Currently most websites are developed without the least concern for accessibility which makes them difficult or impossible for some people to use and the way JavaScript is being used is a very big part of that problem.</p>
<p>Websites that create barriers for people with disabilities are generally just badly designed. Making websites accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. And you, as a frontend developer, must understand that it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your web application contains as few barriers as possible. If you don't do that, then why are you doing frontend development in the first place?</p>
<p>Web development is not about how to make the work fast and easy for the "lazy" frontend developer who long since has forgotten how to manually do anything and as a result no longer knows or understands how to put a simple website together without the use of a barrier producing framework or technology.</p>
<p>The optimal solution will always be to make sure that basic functionality works without JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that more and more people disable JavaScript uncompromisingly, using extensions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript">NoScript</a>, due to very valid security concerns. If a website isn't working without JavaScript it is loosing potential visitors and customers on a regular basis. If you only use a JavaScript based statistics system, such as Googles Analytics, then you won't even see the problem. You need to look into the statistics running on the backend such as the webserver logs to see how many visitors that visit your website without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<p>Security issues from third party JavaScript widgets and JavaScript libraries are vulnerable aspects of JavaScript that is actively exploited on a massive scale. Security issues in browsers, such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-18/#CVE-2019-11707">CVE-2019-11707</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-19/">CVE-2019-11708</a>, are highly critical issues that are completely mitigated if JavaScript is disabled or removed completely. CVE-2019-11707 is a type confusion vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox that can result in an exploitable crash due to issues in Array.pop which can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects. CVE-2019-11708 is a sandbox escape vulnerability in Prompt:Open Inter-process communication (IPC) messages due to insufficient vetting of parameters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a non-sandboxed parent process to open web content from a compromised child process using a specially crafted Prompt:Open IPC message between the child and parent process. Combining CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 can result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">in arbitrary code execution</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript in the client is not a necessary evil. It is a tool that with great and meticulous care can improve the user experience to a certain degree in some unique situations, but if you are making your regular and non-unique web application depend upon JavaScript, then that is a clear sign that you are doing something very wrong.</p>
<p>Stop pushing JavaScript as a dependency just to make a regular and stupid website run!</p>

<p><time>March 1, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: People are unlikely to make swift changes to their core behaviors. By
detecting what they care about now, you will get an accurate estimation of
their near future behavior. That helps you answer the second question you need
to ask during an interview: «Can I work with you?»</p>

<p>The previous behaviors will likely continue to manifest themselves. That is one
of the natural qualities of us humans. Like Newtonian objects, we stay in
motion when we are in motion and lay at rest when we are already at rest. To
change that, we have to exert a massive force and consciously apply it. If we
do it for a long enough time, new behaviors set in and become habits. But
without that effort, we usually continue being who we are. Perfectionists will
continue chasing the ideal state and delaying project deliveries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">Cowboys</a>
will continue YOLOing untested solutions to production. In other words, the
matters people care about now are likely to govern their future behaviors.</p>

<p>That quality is both a challenge and a trait, depending on how you look at it.
If you want to change those behaviors in yourself, that is a challenge. If you
need to understand how a person would behave in a given context, that is a
valuable trait. And you can and should use this trait as a tool to learn more
about your candidates.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://autoiterative.com/blog/posts/what-to-ask-when-interviewing/">previous post</a>, we introduced a framework for hiring software
engineers.  It consists of three questions that you need to get sincere answers
to:
</p><ol>
<li>Can the candidate do the work?</li>
<li>Can I work with you?</li>
<li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to answer the first question is to let them do some actual work.
To answer the second one, assess their current behaviors and map them to your
company culture. This post explains in detail how to perform such an
assessment.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-work-with-you">Can I work with you?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, all you need to do is compare a candidate behavior to
your company culture.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate what we mean with a concrete case. At AutoIterative, we have
already pulled all the hard work of defining what our culture is. For example,
one of our core values at AutoIterative is «to do science instead of
cargo-culting.» That means that we always want to understand why we do
what we do. Whether ideas are ours or not, we are comfortable questioning and
challenging them. So how do we determine where the candidate stands in that
regard? Could we ask straight whether they are confident with challenging their
ideas? Sure, but that will not give us a rigorous assessment. Chances are, the
answer would be: «yes, of course, I am!» We do not want to measure
wishful thinking or imagination. The better question would be to ask a
candidate about the last time they had their ideas challenged. From their
answers, we can derive a more reliable estimation of their behavior.</p>

<p>Let us show how a typical conversation could unroll (along with our notes
explaining why do we ask what we ask):</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Tell me about a recent
case when someone challenged an idea that you introduced?

<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Once, I pushed for the idea
of adding monitoring to our service. It was roughly a year ago, and I got a lot
of pushback from my team.

</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer hints that the candidate cares about monitoring and metrics.
It is also helpful for analysis: it tells us how long ago that happened, it is
relevant, and it presents a situation. It is worth investigating in-depth, so
we decide to continue exploring it.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, what
happened? What was the pushback?
<span>(Note that we are using an open-ended
question here. We do not want our biases to influence their answers.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Well, we were having issues
in production at that moment. We were spending a lot of time reading logs,
trying to understand what was happening. Also, we were under pressure to
deliver a new feature. That could be the reason why people were not really
receptive to my idea when I proposed it. One of the engineers said that we have
no time for it now.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer sheds even more light on the situation. First, it reveals
that the team was under pressure (a data point on how the candidate might
perform in such circumstances). Second, it shows that the candidate wanted to
improve the situation by investing in observability (this is great for us!). It
also tells us there was a conflict (a data point on how the candidate might
defuse them). Now we should dig into those individual aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Why did you want to add
metrics?
<span>(asking <i>why</i> will force the candidate
to explain their reasoning. That defines the task they had to do at the
moment.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Because reading logs is not
the same as having metrics that you can query. Some visibility would have
improved the situation. I just wanted to understand the problem, fix it and
prevent us from getting into it in the future. We had to start somewhere, and
having those metrics would have provided a lot of value.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: This candidate demonstrates that they care about the runtime (a valuable
trait for us!). They opt to invest a bit today for a better future (again,
aligned with our values). If they care about those things in our company, we
would be happy to work with them. Now, let us dig into the conflict bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, and how did
you handle the situation of your coworker saying a flat-out «no» to
your idea?
<span>(Note that here we exaggerate a bit what the
candidate said. Will they correct our impression? Will they confirm it and
elaborate more on how they saw the situation?)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I did not reply at the
exact time they said no. I did not want to provoke a conflict in front of
everyone during a standup meeting. It was not the first time I got a pushback
either. But we were all suffering, and I thought it was critical to add metrics
to our system to help us out of the situation. So after the meeting, I
approached my manager and explained the value we will get if we have metrics. I
asked for help pushing this forward.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: yes, this was an open conflict, and we need to drive the questions to
the resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: And what happened? How
did you present the idea to your manager?
<span>(Note the open-ended question again. It
pushes the candidate to explain <i>how</i> they behaved, allowing us to derive
the <i>why</i> behind that.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I explained that we were
drowning in operational work and that we were blind. I learned in the SRE book
that measuring requests and latencies is one of the first steps to do.  <span>(Note: this could be cargo-culting. Let us make a
note, so we can later dig into their reasoning.)</span> I thought it made sense
to try it. I told my manager that I was ready to take ownership of the whole
process. Initially, I just wanted to add a couple of metrics as a proof of
concept and see if that improved our situation.  If it did, we would spend less
time debugging and more time working on features. He liked the idea, and we
started working on a plan to communicate to our team that I would start working
on it.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: From their answers, we already have a clear definition of the action
that the candidate took. But there are more data points about the candidate.
They think about the team’s success (time spent working on a product instead of
debugging). They built a proof-of-concept to validate the idea before proposing
a full solution. They approached the manager asking for help instead of openly
arguing back. This behavior could hint at them being context-aware and a
team-player. They understood that the whole team is under stress caused by the
pressure to deliver.</p>

<p>The natural next step would be to push for closure and ask how the situation
ended. If you need more context, you can continue asking open-ended questions.
You will discover more details and get a more refined picture of a candidate’s
behavior. You can ask what the candidate learned from the situation and what
conclusions they drew from it. But let us wrap up the example here.</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>

<p>As many of you probably realized, this is an interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOARA">SOARA</a>
techniques. The question explicitly asks for a story from the past, not for an
imaginary scenario. How a candidate replies to such an interview will yield a
lot of information and map to a behavior. Their answer will tell a story, and
their narrative will highlight what they value. From that, we would see what
their natural tendencies will be. And if you did your introspection and know
what your behaviors are, then comparing those two will answer whether you can
work together.</p>

<p>Note, however, that those techniques are not a silver bullet either. They will
not give you a 100% precise picture of a candidate out of a limited interview
time. No method will do that for you. But when applied correctly, they raise
your accuracy way above just the feelings. Focus on understanding and
thoroughly defining your culture. That will give you the exact dimensions along
which to measure your candidates. That, in turn, will provide a set of values
to assess. From them, you get an understanding of which questions are efficient
for you and which are not. Practice using the best ones, and you will answer
the second question with ease and precision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the AutoIterative platform will assess the candidate’s ability to do
the work.</p>

<h2 id="and-of-course-the-marketing-pitch">… and, of course, The Marketing Pitch™</h2>

<p>We solved the problem of software developer technical assessment. You no longer
need to resort to obscure rituals or torture them with the «Can you
reverse a linked list on a whiteboard?» (true story™) type of
questions. You no longer have to <i>*guess</i> whether the candidate can
deliver something that works. With the AutoIterative Production Challenges™,
you can instead just <i><em>test</em></i> that. And you can do it without investing a
single engineering hour before you know the answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <p>Was pulled in to a fun customer issue last Friday around disabling RC4 in Active Directory. What happened was, as you can imagine, not good: RC4 was disabled and half their environment promptly started having a Very Bad Day.</p> <p>— Steve Syfuhs (@SteveSyfuhs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSyfuhs/status/1366526316397301761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Twitter warning:&nbsp;</strong>Like all good things this is mostly correct, with a few details fuzzier than others for reasons: a) details are hard on twitter; b) details are fudged for greater clarity; c) maybe I'm just dumb.</p> </blockquote> <p>RC4 is a stream cipher. A stream cipher is kinda sorta like a one time pad (note: kinda, and sorta). A one-time pad is a cryptographic operation that takes one value and XORs it against a random value. A^B = C. A is your data, B is random noise. C is your encrypted cipher.</p> <p>They're incredibly useful because the XOR operation is only reversible when you know A or B, and if B is suitably random that means you have to guess for all combinations of B. In other words you have to brute force it. As far as cryptography goes that's nearly perfection.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbcZfVVkAMDSrh.jpg" alt="RC4 is broken" width="691" height="1203" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbcZfVVkAMDSrh.jpg"></p> <p>However, the trick with one-time pads is that you need as many random bits as you have data. If you have 10 data you need 10 random. If you 10k data you need 10k random. You cannot repeat the random, lest you introduce a pattern and code breakers just love patterns.</p> <p>So a stream cipher could take a one-time pad and cut the key down to a fixed length, manipulating the key every operation. Let's say you have 100 data and 10 random. The first 10 data get XOR'ed to the 10 random, then the 10 random get XOR'ed to something else. Repeat 10 times.</p> <p>This turns out to be incredibly simple to code and is incredibly fast relative to other crypto algorithms. However, the cost is that you're now doing key scheduling which means if you can predict the schedule you've broken the cipher.</p> <p>RC4 fits the bill here. It's painfully simple to implement. Here it is in entirety. But it's also irreparably broken.</p> <p>The thing with RC4 is that if you have enough data transformed by a single key you can eventually predict what the original plaintext is. This became a semi-practical attack in 2013 when some smart folks figured out how to apply this to TLS. <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/">https://isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/</a></p> <p>For this attack to happen it requires observing billions of bytes of data. This is done easily enough with TLS, hence why folks jumped at disabling RC4 cipher suites. TLS isn't the only place RC4 is used, and RC4 is still broken, so it's just good form to disable it everywhere.</p> <p>So now we have Active Directory and RC4 is enabled by default. In 2021?! How dare. Weeeeeelllll, RC4 isn't quite that bad in this case. Like, it's bad, but not super bad because each key will only ever be used for encrypting small amounts of data.</p> <p>The current attacks require observing *lots* of data encrypted with a single RC4 key. For Kerberos we're talking maybe 8-16kb at most, not the gigabytes required for the attack. So it's bad, but not end of the world bad.</p> <p>But that's no excuse. Why is it still there? Well, it turns out the RC4 cipher suite has a unique property: it doesn't require a salt when doing key agreement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Huh?</p> <p>So Kerberos has two legs between a client and KDC. AS and TGS.&nbsp;</p> <p>AS is how you authenticate yourself: here's password gimme krbtgt.&nbsp;</p> <p>TGS is: here's krbtgt gimme service ticket.</p> <p>Now we don't ever just send the password to the server. What we do is we encrypt a thing using the password as a key and fire that thing over to the server. The server also has your password and can decrypt. If it decrypts then we agree we both know the password.</p> <p>But Active Directory doesn't store the password itself. It stores a key derived from the password. That is, take the password and hash it, and store that hashed value. You encrypt against this hashed value.</p> <p>So lets go back in time, circa mid 90's when Active Directory was being built. Back then, in the real world, Windows authentication was NTLM. NTLM kinda sorta worked similarly where you derived a key from a password and used that key to sign some stuff.</p> <p>That derivation was and is admittedly very lame. It's `md4(password)`. So in NT Server in the directory database was username + md4(password), and that's it.</p> <p>And taking the cryptographic properties of NTLM out the picture for a moment, it still kinda sucked as an authentication protocol. It didn't offer server authentication and it wasn't easily extendable for future changes. So Active Directory switched to Kerberos.</p> <p>But we wanted upgrades to be seamless. When you left work Friday afternoon logging in to NT and came back Monday morning we wanted you to be able to log in to AD without any fuss, despite the fact that we changed literally everything out from under you.</p> <p>And Kerberos at the time was using DES (eww). This posed a problem. You can't transform an MD4 key into a DES key. The protocol certainly didn't let you do weird things like DES(MD4(password)), so Windows created the MD4+RC4 crypto system.</p> <p>The magic of this is that the NTLM key and Kerberos key are interchangeable so no password changes were required. Over time as users changed their passwords Active Directory would derive these newer, stronger, keys and would inform clients to prioritize these stronger keys.</p> <p>This turns out to be phenomenally powerful because it transparently migrates users to stronger keys without breaking anyone, at a small cost of delaying weeks or months as password changes occur. Is it perfect? No. Does it keep the masses happy? Yes.</p> <p>But there's another small problem: salts. Salts add randomness to passwords, making their hashed form incomparable to other hashes. hash('password', salt1) &lt;&gt; hash('password', salt2). We do this for all sorts of reasons, but the primary is so it's harder to guess the password.</p> <p>But salts complicate the protocol. Both client and KDC need to take the password and salt and derive the same key, so both need to know them. Seems simple enough? Just use a well known value...?</p> <p>Ah no, they need to be unique, otherwise two identical passwords with the same salt will form the same hash. Oops. Okay, compute a salt from the username. Aha, here we go, this works. It's unique and both parties know it. And it doesn't change! Oh wait, it can.</p> <p>Users change their usernames all the time because names change all the time. If the salt were just the username that means we'd have to recompute the hash in AD every time the username changed, which means we'd need to know the password and only admins change usernames so 🤔.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbpCjIVcAEjMED.jpg" alt="AS-REP Ping response" width="457" height="387" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbpCjIVcAEjMED.jpg"></p> <p>Okay, so what if the KDC only changes the salt on password change and just tells us what it is whenever we authenticate? And so this is how Kerberos works. The client "pings" (no not ICMP) the KDC and the KDC says here ya go.</p> <p>And so long story short (hahahaha, oh.) we come to the customer issue. RC4 doesn't require a salt. AES requires a salt. You can see in the previous screenshot the ARCFOUR instance doesn't provide a salt because there just isn't one.</p> <p>If you use RC4 you don't need to ping the KDC. You can just derive the key from the password and go. Therefore if you disable RC4 conversely you must always know the salt.</p> <p>This poses a small challenge. Sometimes you don't want the system to know the password itself, so you provide these things called keytabs. They're files with some structured data that map users to derived keys. You derive the keys upfront once so you only need the password once.</p> <p>Sometimes these files are generated without having line of sight to a KDC too so the tool generating the file has to guess which salt to use. Sometimes the tool guesses the wrong salt. Oops.</p> <p>So you generate these files and deploy the thing and the system chugs along just fine until you disable RC4 and the whole things comes crashing down. The system was using RC4, and RC4 worked because there wasn't a salt. When it switched to AES it required the salt and...oops.</p> <p>Well that's a pretty lame experience for anyone, let me tell you. Why did the tool guess the wrong salt? I've already told you: because the name changed.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbtgCeVEAgLAHT.jpg" alt="UPNs can change" width="416" height="563" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbtgCeVEAgLAHT.jpg"></p> <p>Active Directory lets you change your username. You actually have two different usernames. Your sAMAccountName and your UPN. You can use either to log in with Kerberos, but Active Directory will only derive your salt from a single value: the sAMAccountName + Realm.</p> <p>Well it happens that their UPN is in the form samaaccountname@customrealm.com, but their realm is anotherrealmentirely[.]com. As such their salt was ANOTHERREALMENTIRELY.COMsamaccountname. This happens when you add custom UPN suffixes.</p> <p>The password never changed so the salt never had a chance to change (not that it would). And the tool to generate the keytab just derived the salt from the user principal name, which in most cases is fine, but in this case wasn't.</p> <p>And so you might think to yourself that this isn't that big a deal you haven't ever changed the usernames or the suffixes or anything like that. It turns out there's exactly one scenario that every environment hits: when you promote the first DC in a forest.</p> <p>When you create a forest the domain admin is the machine's local administrator account. I'm not talking implicitly, I'm talking the local admin is copied into the AD database including it's password. The password that was set when you built the machine, before it had a realm.</p> <p>And the domain admin is part of the protected users group so RC4 is already disabled for them. That means they MUST use AES, which means they MUST use a salt, which means the salt had to exist when the machine was first built. Oy.&nbsp;</p> <p>So the realm is the computer name.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvcBd4FVoAQ6NhK.jpg" alt="The realm is the computer" width="945" height="414" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvcBd4FVoAQ6NhK.jpg"></p> <p>Anyway.

December 13, 1996. Revised November 11, 1997.

<center>
<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>
This paper describes a possible Internet service that
some major organization such as
Harvard University, AT&amp;T,
the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers,
the American Mathematical Society, the American Medical Association,
or even the Vatican, might offer: a home page "in perpetuity".
Such a "perpetual page" or "eternity page" or
"e-memorial page" would be a home page that the organization would
help the customer set up, with a guarantee that it would
last for (say) 500 years, or until the organization no
longer exists.
It would list all the things that the customer would like to
be remembered for (accomplishments, family, etc.).
As the population of the U.S. ages,
such a service should prove very popular.
After all, almost everyone wants to be remembered by posterity.
</p><center><h2> Details </h2></center>
<ul>
<li>
The name for this service needs to be chosen with care, and
of course registered. "Eternity service",
"Perpetual page", "Eternity page", "E-memorial page",
"Everlasting page"
are a few possibilities. I will use "Perpetual page"
in this paper.

</li>
<li>
The first version of this paper was written in
December 1996, although the idea for the "Perpetual home page"
first occurred to me in January 1996.
Not surprisingly,
it turns out that other people have had similar ideas, and there may be some
commercial services that provide electronic gravestones available even now.
But my vision is that
this service would be offered by a major organization or institute,
that has already existed for a long time and
has some chance of existing 500 years from now.
And I'm not thinking of tombstones, but home-pages.

</li>
<li>
The "Perpetual page" could include such things as:
<ul>
<li>
photographs of houses, boats, paintings, other precious possessions
</li>
<li>
lists of awards, accomplishments
</li>
<li>
writings, drawings, songs, even unpublished novels
(disk space is cheap)
</li>
<li>
links to perpetual pages of one's family (including ancestors!) and friends
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
This is the customer's chance to write their own
<em>New York Times</em> obituary page, or "time capsule".
(Many people do not realize that except for a handful of major obituaries,
every obituary item in the <em>New York Times</em> has to be
purchased at about $40 per line -- this can be a humiliating
experience for the next-of-kin.
Setting up a "Perpetual page" in advance for the sick
and elderly could be both therapeutic and comforting for the family.)

</li>
<li>
There should be a generous amount of disk
space available for each page - a minimum of ten megabytes,
to allow a number of photographs to be included. (Most Internet
providers at present do not allow nearly enough disk space.)
As my colleague 
Andrew Odlyzko has pointed out in his
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~amo/doc/tragic.loss.txt">
discussion of the future of scholarly journals</a>,
the cost of disk space is dropping so rapidly that it is likely that 
the cost of providing a service
in perpetuity will be not much more than that of providing it for
one year.

</li>
<li>
The organization would help the customer set up the initial page, and would
provide instructions on how to maintain it.
A "help desk" would be part of the service.

</li>
<li>
One way to structure the offer might be to tell customers:
For a one-time fee of $X, we will provide you with Y MB of
storage, and as long as you pay a small monthly fee,
you can keep modifying it.  Once you stop paying the monthly fee
(say because you die, or switch to a different
provider) we will keep the latest version <em>forever</em>.

</li>
<li>
Part of the offer would be a guarantee that when the Internet is replaced
by some other service in a few years, all the "Perpetual pages"
would be automatically converted to the new medium.

</li>
<li>
It is important that the organization offering the servce
should have been in existence for a long time, and have a good chance of
still existing 500 hundred years from now.
The organizations mentioned in the Abstract certainly
satisfy these conditions, and it is easy to think of others. 
Such a service would not carry much conviction
if offered by some tiny local Internet service provider.

</li>
<li>
This is the first time in history that such a thing is possible.

</li>
<li>
Incidentally,
the <em>New York Times</em>} for Saturday Dec. 7 1996 describes (on page D2)
a patent, US 5,517,791, for a new tombstone design that can
incorporate a person's life story - including photographs.
So ideas like the one I am proposing are "in the air".

</li>
<li>
As one may verify by visiting cemeteries in New Jersey, tombstones are rarely
legible after a hundred years have passed.  One of the advertisements for the
proposed service could show a family searching through a
cemetery full of grave stones that have been worn smooth,
looking for the lost grave of an ancestor.  Furthermore,
as the world population continues to explode,
cemeteries will become increasingly irrelevant.

</li>
<li>
The "perpetual page" service would especially appeal to mature customers.
There are several ways in which advertisements could point out the futility
of earlier attempts to be remembered, even by world leaders.
For example, one advertisement could show a replica of the original
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
after which all later mausoleums are named.
(See <em>The Oxford History of the Classical World</em>,
ed. J. Boardman et al., Oxford, 1993, p. 150.)
<center> <img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/maus1.jpg"> </center>
<p>
One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it was
built in the year 353 for King Mausolus of Caria by his wife.
It no longer exists.
"But if King Mausolus had had a perpetual page, we could still read
about his victories today ...".

</p></li>
<li>
An alternative way in which the "perpetual page" could be used is
by family and friends after the death of a loved one, by setting up a
permanent memorial for the deceased.  The Page would need to have an
authorized keeper, to screen out inappropriate material.
A certain amount of permanent space would be purchased, to which
interested parties could contribute in any way they wished.


</li>
<li>
Another advertisement could have a voice reading P. B. Shelley's
poem <strong>Ozymandias</strong>,
while the picture shows dust blowing around an appropriate ruin:

<pre>     I met a traveller from an antique land 
     Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
     Stand in the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
     Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
     And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
     Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
     Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
     The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
     And on the pedestal these words appear: 
     `My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' 
     Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
     Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
     The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</pre>
<center><img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/ozy4.jpg"> </center>
</li>
<li>
It will also give all the unpublished poets and writers,
the unrecognized painters and musicians, the scientists
whose theories are rejected, the opportunity to have their
work immortalized.

</li>
<li>
Yet another advertisement could have Jessye Norman singing the moving
and unforgettable aria "Remember Me"
from Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas".
(The formal title
is "Thy hand Belinda - when I am laid in Earth"
[Philips CD 434 161-2].)

</li>
</ul>

<p>“What is the point of using a tool that will facilitate you to do something you don’t even know what it is? That’s not facilitation. That’s ignorance support and MUST be avoided”. Mário Júnior</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web is a very interesting and powerful platform but exploring its powers requires knowledge of their existence and a bit of its internals comprehension. The most essential terms when we talk about web are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a>. Some people would argue that I should add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON</a> to the list, but lets just say JSON is included in JavaScript. If you know these terms and you are familiar with them, then you got a word to say about web development.</p>
<p>The terms I just listed define the web and most of them are not just terms, are languages with their very own purpose, syntax, and limitations: HTML, CSS, JS.</p>
<p>Imagine having to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript without the proper tools to assist you for example: debugging JavaScript code, Inspecting CSS properties and DOM Elements. This was the stack of challenges that web developers had to face long back ago if they decided to embrace that trio. To get around this, technology companies came up with Frameworks literally <em>giving developers the possibility of building web application without having to master HTML and CSS and without even writing a single line of JavaScript.</em></p><p><a data-bid="2" href="https://techblog.hostmoz.net/en/linkout/11671/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?fit=620%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?fit=620%2C90&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?resize=300%2C44&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" width="620" height="90"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK,</a> <a href="http://www.javaserverfaces.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSF</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ASP</a>, all them still sell with that same propaganda, but now we have the tooling we needed to use that trio.</p>
<p>Now we got web browsers with super-powers and <em>we don’t just want to be presenting forms to users</em>. These new features the browsers are supporting, are supposed to be used to enhance business processes, to make an effective change in users lives and this is why I brought this conversation to the table, because most of us seem to be stuck in that tooling-less time.</p>
<p>People no longer make jokes about JavaScript, they follow it, they love it so much that they even made some effort to have it running in other environments different from web browsers (take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NODE.JS</a> project as an example). Microsoft even invested creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> and yet you hate and fear JavaScript?</p>
<p>Some people would argue that in enterprise, “how it looks” is not the most important, because the most important is that “it works”. For these people, I would say: “How it looks” defines the time the user will take to accomplish his goals, “How it looks” may not matter when you are offering a solution to someone that has no choice, because if that person has a choice, trust me, I would stick to the solution that works and looks better. <strong>People don’t want to open their browsers on their retina display powered screens to see some “basic” web app that “just works”.</strong> Wake up fellers, it’s not the “just make it work” era anymore. Presentation can make people happier and happy people are guaranteed to deliver better results, now tell me that’s not an “enterprise” matter!</p>
<p>We can also shift the view, from the end-user perspective to the software design perspective. Frankly speaking, web servers are only useful nowadays because they allow us to deliver dynamic content. But the client-side (Browsers) only understands HTML, CSS and JS. The framework you use, being it <strong>ZK, JSF, ASP</strong> or whatever HTML generator engine you use that sells you the “no javaScript” propaganda, will actually generate HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then send it straight to the browser. What if you write HTML, CSS and JS by yourself? What if you separate the client from the server, as the best practices suggest (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separation of concerns</a>)? Wouldn’t you get a clear vision of what each of the layers should do? Instead of gluing them and building some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monolithic</a> and server-dependent web app? Wait! Did I just say “server-dependent”? Yes I did say that and what I was trying to say is that, you shouldn’t need a server to test the UI (only the UI) of a web app. If you detach your UI from your Back-End and use pure web technologies (CSS, HTML and JS), you get the chance to explore the maximum of each of the parts and that’s what you are supposed to do. You are supposed to give the best you can and right now, <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrimeFaces</a>, <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK</a>, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telerik</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICEfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IceFaces</a>, etc, are the best you can. These tools are limiting your power, thus, limiting the power of your enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>I have nothing against these ideas, companies, or their owners</strong>, and I don’t want them to be extinct, I want them to evolve their business too. I want them to stop selling frameworks that will uniformize UI and <strong>start selling services</strong>. I want them to sit and build a UI for a specific problem, with the attention that specific problem deserves, using the pure web.</p>
<p>I had this idea for too long in my mind and I lived with the fear of unleashing it, but then I realised I’m not the only one with this thoughts. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Fowler</a>, I have been reading some of his articles, watching some tech-talks of his and he is a professional I admire and I look at as an inspiration. When I figured out that the company he works for, is kinda advising people to do exactly what I have been thinking about, I told myself: “It’s time to unleash this thoughts and raise a debate if necessary”. Martin fowler works for <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThoughtWorks</a>, a software respected company that have developed solutions for companies all over the world and here is what they said about JSF and ASP Forms:</p>
<p>“We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF – JavaServer Faces – and are recommending you avoid this technology. Teams seem to choose JSF because it is a Java EE standard without really evaluating whether the programming model suits them. We think JSF is flawed because its programming model encourages use of its own abstractions rather than fully embracing the underlying web model. JSF, like ASP.NET webforms, attempts to create stateful component trees on top HTML markup and the stateless HTTP protocol. The improvements in JSF 2.0 and 2.2, such as the introduction of stateless views and the promotion of GET, are steps in the right direction, maybe even an acknowledgement that the original model was flawed, but we feel this is a too little too late. Rather than dealing with the complexity of JSF we recommend teams use simple frameworks and work closely with web technologies including HTTP, HTML and CSS.” ThoughtWorks Radar</p>
<p>I think the essential was caught. <strong>Let’s embrace the real web and lets also innovate in presentation in order to enhance and improve the life of our customers and partners</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to end this article with a question for the local enterprises (Maputo/Mozambique): <em>Why aren’t you hiring Front-End/UI/UX engineers? Would it be because you are going monolithic or because presentation doesn’t matter?</em></p>
<p>I want you to leave a contribution on this article. Say something on the comment box down there.</p>
<p>It’s always a pleasure for me to share my thoughts with all of you guyz.</p>

              <p>Hi from the team who built the "mesonet" weather station networks in the state of South Australia!</p>
              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

                    <li>Measure all weather metrics that are relevant in determining whether it is safe to spray</li>
                    <li>Update data every 10 minutes, so farmers have access to the most recent readings</li>

              <a name="webapp"><h2>The Web Application</h2></a>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The key technologies are:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Redis</li>
                    <li>Sidekiq for queue processing</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <a name="results"><h2>Results so far</h2></a>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

audio, which includes emphasis that’s not on the page</i></p><div>
<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

		<p>Yet another PDP-1 riddle, extended mode.</p>

		<p><span>Y</span>esterday, we solved the mystery of <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2021/train-spotting-1">two well-known images</a>, formerly known as “The PDP-1 at the Tech Model Railroad Club”, with the help of the Hacker News community. — A triumph of shared knowledge.</p>
		<p>In 1971, the German artist Daniel Chodowiecki (1726 – 1801) commented his etching “Enlightenment” <em lang="de">(Aufklärung)</em> by the words, “However, if the sun only rises, mists do no harm.” <em lang="de">(Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.)</em> In real life, mists rise only to reveal another bank of fog. Which is the very process of research. — And this is certainly no exception. So this is a post about annother bank of fog, in the amazing form factor of a fully transitorized electronic contraption apt to manipulate 18-bit words in realtime according to a stored program and human interaction.</p>

Es wird auch wohl noch lange das schicklichste bleiben, wegen der Nebel, die immer aus Sümpfen, Rauchfässern und von neuen Brandopfern und Götzenaltären aufsteigen werden, die sie leicht verdecken können. Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.”</p>

		<h2>Another PDP-1B Prototype?</h2>
		<p><span>Y</span>esterday’s sunrise, <em>um,</em> success was the indentification of the scene of a series of images showing a somewhat rudimentary front part of a DEC PDP-1 and a Type 30 Visual CRT display next to a model railway layout. And we proceeded to conclude that this was a PDP-1 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, operated by the Program Head of the CS program, J.A.N. Lee (probably around 1970).</p>

		</figure>

		<p>However, this also posed a new riddle, as at least two sources referred to this machine as a PDP-1B. Namely, the history page of the UMass Amherst CS program’ website,</p>
		<blockquote>
		The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system.

		</blockquote>
		<p>and the title of another photo of the same series (or lot) in the collection of the Computer History Museum (CHM), which isn’t available as a digitized image,</p>

		</blockquote>

		<p>Following established knowledge, there was a single PDP-1A prototype, followed by two PDP-1B pre-production prototypes (one going to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, the other to BBN) and the production models PDP-1C and PDP-1D, the latter being the enhanced time-sharing model. Further, the two pre-production prototypes had a 4-cabinets main unit, which was repackaged for a more cost effective and reliable 3-cabinets design, and finally to a 4-cabinets design allowing for dedicated space for expansion modules for the production models. This history leaves no apparent room for a PDP-1B at Amherst. So is this an error in these attributions, maybe referring to a common source as a single point of failure, or is there more to this?</p>
		<p>Update: Gordon Bell et al. mention a third PDP-1 prototype in <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/_Books/Bell-ComputerEngineering.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="PDF">Computer Engineering. A DEC View of Hardware System Design</a> (Digital Press, Maynard, MA, 1978): <em>“A third machine, similar to the 1/A and 1/B, was constructed for internal use.”</em> (pp. 136, 137)<br>— An internal reference machine was much to be expected. Especially, since the PDP-1A prototype was borrowed to BBN (see below).</p>

		<h2>PDP-1 Lineage</h2>
		<h3>All-White PDP-1s</h3>
		<p>The first prototype, PDP-1A, was an all white machine, featuring an integrated control desk with built-in CRT and operator’s console, a three-cabinet packaging of the main unit, and a Friden Flexowriter as a console typewriter. This machine was presented at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.</p>

		<p>The same machine (and the same image) also appeared in the initial announcement in Datamation, November/December issue 1959:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Then, there is a white 4-cabinets machine seen in early DEC materials, here from a brochure from March 1961. This all-white machine features a 4-cabinets main unit, a detached control console with black print and the early DEC logo (more on this later), a CRT display in similar hexagonal housing as later Type 30 CRTs, but mounted on a narrower, single-unit stand, and a Soroban console typewriter (a modified IBM Model A):</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Apparently, we see this machine again at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), in an image in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> by David Walden and Raymond Nickerson (ed.), 2010; page 51:</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The following, rather blurry image from <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/08/102740407-05-01-acc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Digital Equipment Corporation – Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present”</a> (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, MA, 1972; p.3) seems to show the same machine (all white, 4 cabinets, detached console), but with a different CRT with the standard double-unit display stand. Notably, the paper-tape devices on the left and the chairs look much like the one the BBN image, hinting at the photo showing the same installation.</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>The same configuration appears in yet another photo (from the “DIGITAL Computing Timeline”), here, explicitely tagged as <em>“The PDP-1 operating system, the world's first timesharing system, is written by engineers at MIT and BBN for the PDP-1. (…) Shown here is the PDP-1 installation at BBN.”:</em></p>

		</figure>

		<p>At this point it may be fair to assume that the images of the white PDP-1B, found in early DEC brochures, are actually depicting the BBN PDP-1B.</p>

		<p>The last image (to my humble knowledge) in this lineage of all-white PDP-1s featuring a detached console seems to be an early production PDP-1 in 3-cabinets packaging at Itek (allegedly the second production machine):</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>Something, all these all-white machines with a detached console have in common, is that they are lacking an integrated paper-tape unit. In these images, we see a separate generic paper-tape unit associated to the machine, usually to the left of the control console. DEC even envisioned the tape unit as a detached desk appliance, much like the control console:</p>

		<p>Here’s a short history of this strand of PDP-1s, as comprehensively told in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> (ibidem, pp. 53–55):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Eastern Joint Computer Conference was in Boston in December 1959, and there Fredkin saw the PDP-1 and “realized it was fantastic.”
		The project to design and build the PDP-1 had started just four months prior to that. Ben Gurley was the designer, and he also built the computer with the help of one engineering assistant.</p>
		<p>“So,” says Fredkin, “I convinced BBN to become Digital’s first customer for the PDP-1. We arranged to borrow the prototype PDP-1 while Digital built the first ‘production’ version.” The prototype machine (a PDP model 1a) was delivered to BBN in early 1960.
		At the time, according to Fredkin, Digital had the idea that a computer manufacturer shouldn’t do software. Thus, Fredkin wrote the assembler for the machine, wrote utility routines (like a rudimentary operating system), and so forth. In that era programs were typically written on ruled sheets with columns for the various fixed-length instruction fields. Ed’s assembler for the PDP-1 was called FRAP, which stood for “free of rules assembly program” and which allowed variable-length instructions. At some point Fredkin also wrote light pen software for the machine.</p>
		<p>Eventually the first production model PDP-1, a PDP model 1b system (serial number 2), arrived at BBN. That was Digital’s first PDP-1 sale. Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>When the PDP-1b arrived, BBN had a ceremony with a lot of hoopla. I wrote a little program so that the PDP-1b could cut its own ribbon at a ribbon-cutting ceremony (appropriate since one of the ideas was for the PDP-1 to interact with the real world). Digital founder Ken Olsen was present.</p>
		<p>Bill Fletcher also was working with Fredkin on the PDP-1b. (…)</p>
		<p><strong>PDP-1b Time-Sharing: the Research Computer System</strong></p>
		<p>Fredkin says that he had the idea of hiring John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. This soon led to plans to develop a time-sharing system for the PDP-1. McCarthy had the idea of time-sharing, and Fredkin saw the potential for time-sharing on the PDP-1. (…) Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>John’s invention of time-sharing and his telling me about his ideas all occurred before the PDP-1 existed. When I first saw the PDP-1 at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, I realized that it was …</p></blockquote></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are usually involved in projects demanding a high level of software quality, whether they be large legacy applications, where the customer is already beset with problems and is trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted, or newer pilot projects, which need to be built on stable foundations. As experienced technical experts we can of course help to get things on the right track. Having said that, we frequently find that our customers initially do not understand how quality is about a lot more than just good technology.</p><p>Even technically excellent teams can slip into quality problems if the working conditions or the project goal are unclear. In this article we explain why this is the case and what we can do about it.</p><h2>Is it a bug or a feature?</h2><p>Poor software quality often only comes to management’s attention when the number of errors reaches an unacceptable level. Yet what is actually a bug and what is just a (missing) feature? This question often leads to discussions between the product and development teams and cannot, strictly speaking, be answered without a clear written specification of the software’s requirements.</p><p>How do we decide during development what can be removed and what needs to remain? Most developers have experienced the situation where a bug fix leads to a string of new ones, due to something “not working like it used to” in the new version. For fear of breaking something, we often see developers steer clear of improving bad software design, which in turn leads to a continuing deterioration of the software’s maintainability.</p><p>To escape from this dilemma we need a shared understanding of what the software actually is: that is to say, what can it do and what not? Each user story should include clear acceptance criteria and, where applicable, define what is out of scope. For effective software development the team also needs to understand the broader context, i.e. not just <em>what</em> it is developing, but also <em>why</em> it is required and what concrete use cases are envisaged. Experienced teams avoid bugs through this type of communication, before they even begin with the implementation in code.</p><p>The development team still of course needs the right technical skills and experience in order to ensure that the software functions properly and is adequately protected through automated tests. Best practices such as pair programming, code reviews and test driven development (TDD) can help achieve this.</p><h2>Tests</h2><p>We frequently encounter projects with inadequate test coverage. Our approach is not to write new code or fix a bug without corresponding automated tests to verify the expected behaviour. This, however, presupposes that it is clear what the software is supposed to do.</p><p>Acceptance criteria in a user story serve as a basis for understanding this. Acceptance test driven development (ATDD) even goes so far as to translate the written specification into executable tests. Similarly, in the case of bugs, the way in which the functionality deviates from expected behaviour and how the error can be reproduced need to be clearly defined. This information can then be mapped into appropriate automated test cases so as to ensure functional correctness and avoid regression.</p><p>It is critical for the business to understand high test automation as an integral part of high-quality software <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/2020/09/wie-qualitaet-uns-schneller-macht/">which actually makes development faster</a>: development speed should always be measured based on <em>working</em> features. Unfortunately, the deployment of technical experts is in many cases not enough to communicate this message, rather, the business often requires significant cultural and organisational upheaval, which reaches as far as management level, to achieve this. Development teams cannot bring about such a change on their own.</p><p>Additionally, efficient test automation can only be achieved when developers and testers work together cross-functionally. If testing is only carried out after the development stage (for example by a dedicated QA department) many of the advantages of test automation, such as fast feedback loops, are lost. Consequently organisational aspects such as team structure and process often go hand in hand with technical matters.</p><p>It is, on the other hand, not enough just to deliver good requirement documents and to expect a new culture to appear. Teams need to be capable of mapping these requirements onto an efficient test pyramid and ensuring the software still works in ensuing months and years. Even good teamwork is a skill that cross-functional teams need to learn through practice.</p><p>Furthermore, code testability is very much dependent on good software design. Technical methods, for example test driven development and refactorings, can help to improve this, and such methods can be more readily established when experienced developers or coaches are on hand.</p><h2>Refactorings</h2><p>Legacy applications often suffer from old code being difficult to understand and maintain. This leads to new features being very expensive and to an ever-increasing bug rate.</p><p>Experienced teams refactor their application code continuously and ideally avoid these pitfalls. They are capable of recognising how the software design can be improved as they go along in order to implement the current feature and regularly switch between the “two hats” (new functionality and refactoring) to achieve the goal in hand. They also keep an eye on upcoming requirements to ensure the technical foundations are optimised to deal with them. In order to achieve this they keep open a continuous dialogue with product team representatives and understand the current business goals.</p><p>But what happens when larger refactorings are required? Teams with only a technical focus might prefer to leave no stone unturned in order to achieve their interpretation of technical perfection and might even push for a complete rewrite of the application. This is, however, rarely the most efficient use of limited resources.</p><p>Refactorings should always be geared towards making the job in hand and future requirements easier and quicker to implement. Yet in order to achieve this, it is important to understand where the application is heading. A clear product vision and strategic focus on defined goals is critical so that refactorings with the most value (i.e. which improve future development speed) can be prioritised.</p><p>Whether larger refactorings should be undertaken is always a judgement call, which cannot be made solely based on technical reasons. A clear product strategy, which defines the key parameters for anticipated functional requirements, is incredibly helpful to estimate the relative effort of the refactorings and to answer important questions such as:</p><ul><li>How and to what extent will this component be extended in the coming development cycles?</li><li>Does the current software design satisfy the requirements on the product roadmap?</li><li>Do we (in the worst-case scenario) need to throw this component away and start from scratch?</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, even the best product vision cannot be fulfilled if teams do not have the technical skills to dig themselves out of the hole they find themselves in. Once it is clear where the journey is heading, developers still need the right technical skills and training to understand how to refactor a legacy application and keep the project on the right track.</p><h2>Architecture</h2><p>Software architecture is not an end in itself, but should seek to provide an optimal technical foundation for the product’s business requirements. There is no such thing as “the best architecture”, rather, it is always a question of making trade-offs. A software product will always have multiple architecture goals which conflict with and need to be weighed up against each other. Again, the product’s goal and its functional requirements will also play an important role here in making the appropriate architectural decisions.</p><p>During development, even the best teams will keep coming up against conflicts between current and future requirements. On the one hand, software architecture should be evolutionary and be improved incrementally, as it is impossible to predict users’ feedback and the exact nature of future priorities. Yet, on the other hand, certain architectural decisions do need to be made early enough in the development process so that the right foundation is in place to facilitate productive development. Only a well-functioning team, which not only brings together the relevant technical and business knowledge but also assumes responsibility for the software’s architecture, will be in a position to make the right decisions and react to changes in requirements in the best possible way.</p><p>Only through such teamwork is it possible to identify the right context boundaries in the application and to define the business domains and their objects. It is also critical to establish a universal language for these domains, so that business objects and the software’s use cases are clearly understood by the entire team.</p><p>Successful teams discuss the software’s architecture as part of their daily business and are able to experiment with various possible solutions. This is not possible in organisations where small predefined tasks are imposed on development teams from above or where teams are constantly under pressure from external deadlines. Agile practices in self-organised teams are therefore an important precondition for good architecture decisions.</p><p>It is, on the other hand, not enough simply to introduce agile frameworks and hope that this leads to teams being immediately capable of good software architecture. This will usually not be the case without support and coaching from experienced developers, especially if the previous working conditions were very different and the developers do not have prior experience of working in self-organised teams.</p><h2>Code quality and the “four eyes principle”</h2><p>Methods such as clean code, pair programming and code reviews help to achieve a high level of software quality. As technical coaches we can help out in these areas, but this …</p></div></div>

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know should know by now the perpetual licensing pattern: you buy a license to certain software, you receive updates for a year or two, depending on the license, then you stop receiving updates for the app and you can use that version forever.</p>



<p>The main problem with this type of license, from a user’s perspective, is consistency. <a href="https://pacurar.dev/uses/">I use</a> quite a few software with this type of license BUT the main difference is that some are updated daily/weekly or at least monthly and some are less frequently updated.</p>



<p>Most applications receive tons of updates after the initial release and then they magically stop receiving updates or new features for a while. My question is: why buy another year of your software if in the past 5-6 months I received only a minor update? What will I miss if you do not update it? Well, for most applications, you won’t miss anything… except some euros in your pocket.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there’s software like TablePlus that is fully worth paying for it year by year because it is updated a lot and you would miss a lot of features if you are stuck on an old version.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I have a problem with all subscriptions lately. You pay a subscription for everything, and now you are required to pay monthly for software too. It all piles up, and sure, developers make more money and they can afford 5$ here and 5$ there, but again, it all piles up and at the end of the month you end up giving a lot of money on licenses.</p>



<p>So… maybe a perpetual license is ok though and it all depends on the developer itself if clients would renew their license: keeping an updated app and adding new features would make a higher percentage of the clients renew their license for another year.</p>



<p>What do you say, what is the best license for you and your needs? How many perpetual licenses do you pay yearly?</p>

First, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result – the scope,” writes Bezos.</p><p id="2783">Recognition and scope, according to Bezos, are the two most important rules to deliver high standards. And in an example that applies directly to writers, he says, “We don’t do PowerPoint presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos.” And the quality of these memos, Bezos admits, varies widely.</p><p id="fa97">Here’s the difference between a great memo and an average one.</p><p id="c6c4">Average writers fail to recognize what differentiates their work from that of the top writers in their field. And this failure of recognition never propels them in the right direction. They can’t do better because they don’t understand what better looks like.</p><p id="5d9e">Although, at Amazon, “often when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more,” writes Bezos.</p><p id="75f4">To prove his point, Bezos uses an interesting <strong>headstand analogy</strong>. He says if you try to perfect a headstand in just two weeks when in reality it takes about six months of daily practice, you’re just going to end up quitting. In other words, it’s not about hard work, it’s about having realistic beliefs on scope.</p><p id="0489">According to Bezos, great memos are:</p><ul><li id="4ea6">written and re-written,</li><li id="468d">shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work,</li><li id="4bf5">set aside for a couple of days,</li><li id="4fee">and then edited again with a fresh mind.</li></ul><p id="11cb">Again, all of these things, re-writing, editing, giving your work the room to grow, and asking for suggestions and improvements, are all really the best pieces of writing advice out there. But, “the key point”, Bezos insists, “is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo (or any piece of writing) probably should take a week or more.”</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>While coding professionally I’ve used Gradle, Maven, and Ant. I think Gradle is my least favorite.</p>
<p>There have been a couple good critiques of Gradle that I’ve read lately. I want to note them here for completeness, but then move on to outline my own frustrations which come from a different angle.</p>
<p>First there is <a href="https://www.bruceeckel.com/2021/01/02/the-problem-with-gradle/">this</a> article by Bruce Eckel. The central argument really spoke to me and got me thinking about this topic. In the post Bruce states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do anything [in Gradle] you have to know everything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been my experience and frustration as well, and is not typically a sign you are using a good tool.</p>
<p>In the second <a href="https://phauer.com/2018/moving-back-from-gradle-to-maven/">article</a>, Philipp Hauer writes about (amongst other things) the unnessisary churn Gradle causes by regularly <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#dependencies_should_no_longer_be_declared_using_the_compile_and_runtime_configurations">breaking compatibility</a>, in addition to the confusing and opaque rules of the DSL.</p>
<p>Again, 100% agree here. I will also note Gradle constantly <a href="https://github.com/gradle/performance-comparisons/blob/e174b35fcd9aef362f8062fe08443870ce2061da/exclude-merging/apiweb/dependencies.gradle#L4">offering</a> <a href="https://github.com/gradle/performance-comparisons/blob/e174b35fcd9aef362f8062fe08443870ce2061da/exclude-merging/apiServiceLayer/dependencies.gradle#L6">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/gradle/build-analysis-demo/blob/4aaac6d82f2dc4bd1e9a7825d420c1b32856f789/build-producerator/build.gradle.kts#L8">ways</a> to do the same thing does not help here :~).</p>
<p>These are both great articles. They’ve made a case I find compelling, and are worth a read, but I’m not going to dive any deeper into those topics. I just want to make them visible, and will now move on.</p>
<p>I want to focus on Gradle from the perspective of a large organization, and how it is a terrible build tool for maintaining numerous projects.</p>

<p>The company I work for uses Gradle heavily now for our builds. We have been migrating to a microservice world for a while now, so have an ecosystem of, I wanna say, a couple hundred services and libraries. All of these services and libraries have at least one - but usually two - Gradle builds, so the total number is roughly 2x that.</p>
<p>We also have one git repository per service, no monorepo, so naturally have some jobs that do care-taking. Bump dependencies, enforce formatting rules, perform small migrations, etc. Gradle is horrible for this type of automation.</p>

<p>So how do we update our <code>build.gradle</code> with new dependencies?</p>
<p>Ultimately we need to be able to understand groovy. We don’t want to write a full-blown interpreter, so we support a subset of what we need to understand in the Gradle DSL. In our case we enforce a convention where each project declares its dependencies in a <code>dependencies.gradle</code> file that is simple enough for dumb parsers to understand and modify.</p>
<p>With this convention we have come full circle! We didn’t like declarative builds because they weren’t flexible enough, so we moved to Gradle, which is really just Groovy. But now we can’t understand what Gradle builds are doing, because the underlying language is too complex for dumb parsers. So we introduce an ad-hoc declarative style.</p>
<p>In the end Gradle enforces very little. There is some convention, but you can really do what ever you want, so gods know what is happening in those hundreds of Gradle files.</p>

<p>There’s another thing we’ve been working on lately. Gradle now has a <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html">Kotlin</a> variation of it’s DSL<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Our company is heavily using Kotlin now, so a developer has been working on a script to migrate the hundreds of projects to the <code>build.gradle.kts</code> format. I agree with this migration. We all use Kotlin, so switching the format will give us more comfort and ease in maintaining those builds. It’s how this migration is happening that made my jaw drop.</p>
<p>In the end everything is just Groovy, and there is no great Groovy to Kotlin converter available, so the present migration strategy is basically: run a bunch of regexes against the <code>build.gradle</code> to optimistically search and replace Groovy with Kotlin syntax. <strong>A human</strong> then needs to come in and fix the final n% of things that didn’t convert properly. On hundreds of projects.</p>
<p>This is insane. For any organization that is trying to build an automated system for updating and migrating hundreds (if not thousands) of projects, it is insane that our best option is use <code>grep</code> and cross our fingers. This is not the first migration we have done, and will not be our last, and the number of projects is only going to increase.</p>

<p>We are a professional community that naturally values structured data and automation. Using Gradle effectively and ironically breaks both these things. We need to do better. So what does that “better” look like?</p>
<p>I actually think Maven got it 90% right. A coworker has a line I really like, that highlights some of what I believe Maven got right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your builds are not special.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% this.</p>
<p>This first thing I like about the Maven model is it discourages doing crazy things! Virtually all builds are just pointing at some source files, referencing some jars, and compiling. Maybe we push the end result somewhere when we’re done. Why on earth are we using a general purpose programming language to declare what should almost always be copying and pasting from a template.</p>
<p>Conversely, Maven discourage hacks and one-offs by limiting us to a purely declarative format. If we <em>really</em> need something special, we have a plugin framework where we can punch out of the stricter declarative world, and then we’re just coding in Kotlin. Boom! Do all the crazy your heart desires.</p>
<p>The other thing Maven got right is having a strict convention and format. This is really where the power lies for large organizations. It’s a simple enough “language” that parsers are multiple and battle tested. How far do you have to reach in a given language to parse and understand XML? In any mainstream language you probably have multiple options. Not just regexes.</p>
<p>This is exactly why Maven tooling has always been so out-of-the-box functional. The structure is well-defined, and there are fewer unexpected things because one-off hacks are discouraged. Gradle tooling on the other hand has always been near non-existent. IntelliJ supports Gradle and does a decent job, but it was a long road to get here. The support was incredibly buggy in early days, and even now seems a little flaky. Meanwhile, Maven tooling has just quietly worked this whole time.</p>
<p>Of course what Maven didn’t get right was XML. Maven was written at the time we all had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">collective insanity</a> and thought everything should be XML. We’re still kinda dealing with the hangover. XML has a lot of properties that are great for builds, but is a total eyesore.</p>

<p>I want something Maven like, but no XML. Right off the bat I don’t think YAML is the right thing here, we want something simpiler and stricter. I’m honestly not sure if a format like this exists, but I’m shouting into the void and hoping a response comes back. If one doesn’t exist maybe we need to <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">make one</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For my build tool and language I want something that has these properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Strict and static. Wouldn’t it be great if IntelliJ yelled at us if we forgot a mandatory argument? Wouldn’t it be great if IntelliJ told us an argument we were using on a plugin is deprecated? Wouldn’t it be great if we could do a “Find Usages” on a dependency or plugin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple. Writing interpreters for this should be easy so automated tools can do their thing. Even better, the build tool itself provides an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An accessible and rich plugin and lifecycle API. Maybe one of the mistakes of Maven was it was too strict, and that led to Gradle. Let’s try to meet in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support rich documentation. This is where XML is especially brutal. What if we could click on the argument of a plugin, and IntelliJ would bring us to well-formatted documentation. 😍.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No meaningful whitespace please. We should have learned this was a bad idea a long time ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First class fat-jars! No Kotlin or Java build tool has this as a first-class feature, and literally every JVM developer I know uses them<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.  The whole JVM world is just relying on some guys <a href="https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow">side project</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a big ask, but I think we need something new. When I look at the herculean efforts made towards the development of Gradle, I can’t help but think it could be redirected to something smaller and simpler. This is such core part of our development workflow. I think it’s worth the investment.</p>

		<p>Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development &amp; learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. At Replit, our goal is to give people coding superpowers by demolishing barriers and democratizing access to expert tools. Today, we're launching our zero-setup unit testing environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/unit_tests/unit_tests.gif" alt="unit tests demo"></p>
<p>At launch we'll support three of our most popular programming languages: Java, Python, and JavaScript pre-setup with the most popular frameworks in each category. We'll be adding more with time, and you can visit our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/UnitTesting">docs</a> for more information about how to get started.</p>
<p>We think this feature will be handy for CS educators, online course creators, and developers. But as always, we're excited to explore unique ways people will leverage this feature. So let us know how you use it!</p>

	<div>
		<p><span>TL;DR:</span> Ada is an extremely interesting and robust programming language that has a lot to offer modern developers of system 
	and bare-metal software. At very least, Ada presents many interesting ideas that designers of modern programming languages could stand to learn much from. If you want a 30 second version of this article, check out the 
	<a href="#practical_example">practical example</a> that I provide for a comparison of Ada with C.</p>

<p>
	Much of the technical material presented in this article is available as part of <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Ajxs">my contributions</a> to <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">osdev.org</a>
</p>
<p>
	I consider myself a rational man. While I may believe in an entirely deterministic model of the universe, I certainly
	do not believe it to be guided by any conscious process.
	I do not believe in destiny. This absence of guidance makes such fortuitous occurrences as the one I will discuss all
	the more extraordinary, and for this I am all the more grateful.
</p>

<h2>A Chance Collision</h2>
<p>
	By no deliberate design of my own, I happen to live close to a university. Not in the kind of ‘University town’ common
	to much of Europe or the United States, but in the densely packed suburban sprawl of the inner-city. My regular walk
	to and from the local shopping centre takes me past several of the buildings belonging to the highly regarded
	engineering faculty of the aforementioned University.
</p>
<p>
	Making my way home one serendipitous afternoon, I happened across a sizeable stack of books sitting on the curb
	outside one of the University’s engineering buildings. The university was ostensibly in the process of liquidating its stockpile
	of old engineering books, and had left them in a pile for the local council to collect. Amongst material covering a
	wide variety of academic disciplines, two books in particular caught my eye: <i>Building Parallel, Embedded, and
	Real-Time Applications with Ada</i>, and <i>Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada</i>.
</p>
<p>
	I had heard of Ada before. I understood that it came from a pedigree of languages developed for the United States
	military, and that it still occupied a niche in the development of safety-critical applications, nothing more.
	Curious, I threw the books in my bag and off I went.
</p>


<h2>Exceeding My Expectations</h2>
<p>Admittedly, I had pictured Ada’s syntax resembling the uncompromising verbosity and rigid construction of COBOL, or
	perhaps the Lovecraftian hieroglyphics of Fortran’s various eldritch incarnations. Turning the pages, I was pleasantly
	surprised by modern constructs associated with modern high-level languages such as ranges, slicing and
	exception-handling. The syntax — Admittedly verbose by modern standards<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup> — seemed deliberately and purposefully
	constructed to make the language comprehensible at a glance.</p>
<p>The fact that Ada was designed with embedded-software in mind was of particular interest to me. I already had some
	limited experience with bare-metal development on the x86 and ARM platforms using C and assembly, so the prospect of
	using higher-level constructs on bare-metal seemed promising to me.</p>

<h2>Not the Camel You Expected</h2>
<p>A common pejorative refrain directed at Ada by its many detractors is that it is a language “designed by committee”,
	or even worse, a language “designed by committee <i>for the military</i>”<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. The implication of which being that (so-called)
	design by committee precludes it from any real-world practicality. I contend that it is better to design a language to fit an
	existing problem domain than to pick your weapon of choice and set out in search of new problem domains to apply it
	to<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup>. I will spare readers a detailed retelling of Ada’s conception within the Department of Defence’s <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/history/holwg-93/holwg-93.htm">‘High Order
	Language Working Group’</a>, save to say that the Ada programming language was born of the need for single, unified
	higher-level language suitable for use in the multitude of Real-Time Embedded systems developed by the DoD<sup><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup>. In the
	wise words of the working-group’s chair, Colonel William A. Whitaker: “It was concluded that no existing language
	could be adopted as a single common high order language for the DoD, but that a single language meeting essentially
	all the requirements was both feasible and desirable.”. If such a thing was indeed feasible, the DoD’s deep pockets
	would help it bring it into existence. Ironically, given its status as the de-facto standard language of modern embedded-system development, the C language was considered unsuitable for this purpose: “When Bell Labs were
	invited to evaluate C against the DoD requirements, they said that there was no chance of C meeting the requirements
	of readability, safety, etc.” (Whitaker, 1993). After its successful implementation, in what would prove a controversial decision, the DoD would go so far as to mandate 
	the use of Ada for all in-house software engineering.</p>

<h2>So What Makes It Special?</h2>
<p>
	Ada has many useful features that are of particular interest for low-level programming and operating-system development. One
	feature in particular that impressed me greatly was Ada’s <i>representation clauses</i> (see below). They provide a highly granular way to define the
	in-memory representation of low-level data structures. I was very quickly able to adapt my own long suffering operating-system development project to Ada, improving the
	quality of my codebase greatly in the process. The following section details some of Ada’s features:
</p>

<h3>Custom Types</h3>
<p>
	In addition to being a strongly typed language, Ada allows for the definition of new scalar, enumerated and record types.
	Custom primitive types can also be constrained to a predefined range of values.
	The example below demonstrates the definition of a new integer type based upon Ada’s native <code>Natural</code> type, restricted
	to a predefined range.
	The use of the subtype directive informs the compiler that other variables of the <code>Natural</code> type are compatible with
	the newly defined subtype.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
<span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>24</span><span>;</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Col</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>subtype</span> <span>Row</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The below example illustrates the creation of incompatible custom integer types. While their base type and range
	constraints are identical, Ada treats both as separate, incompatible types. An assignment of a variable of one type
	to the value of another is illegal, and will trigger a compile-time error.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>A</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
<span>B</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>A</span><span>;</span> <span>-- illegal!</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The following example demonstrates the creation of a custom enumerated type. It also demonstrates a subtype of an enumerated type with a constrained range of values.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span><span>Monday</span><span>,</span> <span>Tuesday</span><span>,</span>
  <span>Wednesday</span><span>,</span> <span>Thursday</span><span>,</span> <span>Friday</span><span>,</span> <span>Saturday</span><span>,</span> <span>Sunday</span><span>);</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Work_Day</span> <span>is</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>range</span> <span>Monday</span> <span>..</span> <span>Friday</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	A variable with the type of <code>Work_Day</code> is restricted to its constrained range. Any attempt to assign a value outside
	of this range to a variable of this type will raise a <code>Constraint_Error</code> exception at runtime.
</p>

<h2>Representation Clauses</h2>
<p>
	Ada allows for explicitly defining the in-memory representation of scalar and compound types. The following example
	demonstrates the definition of a record type (equivalent to structures in C), as well as its associated
	representation in memory.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The format of the System Table Descriptor pointer used by the processor</span>
<span>--  to load descriptor tables like the GDT and IDT.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>is</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>:</span> <span>Unsigned_16</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>:</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Address</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end record</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>48</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>use</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span>  <span>..</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>16</span> <span>..</span> <span>47</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end</span> <span>record</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>System_Table_Descriptor</code> type must be 48 bits in size. The
	record representation clause instructs the compiler as to the required layout of this record type in memory. This
	example specifies that the <code>Size</code> member should occupy bits 0 to 15, and the <code>Offset</code> member should occupy bits 16 to
	47. This feature is analogous to C’s bit-fields. The following example demonstrates defining the in-memory
	representation of an enumerated type.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The privilege level for a particular descriptor.</span>
<span>--  These correspond to the 'protection ring' that this descriptor is</span>
<span>--  accessible from.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>use</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>3</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</code> type must be 2 bits in size.
	The representation clause instructs the compiler as to required representation of each possible value of the
	enumerated type in memory. In this example the value of <code>Ring_0</code> will be represented by a value of <code>0x0</code> in memory, the
	value of <code>Ring_1</code> will be represented by <code>0x1</code>, and so on.
</p>

<h2 id="practical_example">A Practical Example</h2>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>

<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>

<p>This is what we're forcing on people when we ship laggy software. We're making them spend their time waiting for us.</p>

March 1, 2021 | https://www.raywang.org/blog/2021-02/mondays-musings-inside-why-mainframe-alive-and-thriving | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.raywang.org/blog/2021-02/mondays-musings-inside-why-mainframe-alive-and-thriving">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:articleBody">

<p>Mainframes entered the market in the early 1950's when IBM and the seven dwarfs (Burroughs, Unisys, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, GE, and RCA) created the computing age and competed for critical applications, sophisticated modeling, and large-scale transactions and workloads among the largest of organizations.&nbsp; Over the past seven decades, compute power, storage, and networking have seen various waves of centralization and decentralization amidst each wave of disruptive technology adoption.</p>

<p>As with each wave, pundits, analysts, and industry watchers have forecasted the death of the mainframe.&nbsp; Yet, the venerable mainframe has prevailed.&nbsp; In a Q4 2020 update on mainframe usage, IBM shared the following statistics on mainframe adoption:</p>

<ul>
	<li>67 of the Fortune 100;</li>
	<li>45 of the top 50 Banks;</li>
	<li>8 of the top 10 Insurers;</li>
	<li>8 of the top 10 Telcos;</li>
	<li>7 of the top 10 Retailers;</li>
	<li>4 of the top 5 Airlines;</li>
</ul>

<p>use the mainframe.</p>

<p>While it may be one thing to tout usage of a technology by which organizations continue to adopt a technology, IBM has grown usage as measured by MIPS, a method of calculating the raw speed used, by 350% over the past ten years.</p>



<p>The newest mainframes include the latest <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2018/0417-01.html">Fujitsu GS21 </a>series announced April 2018 along with Fujitsu Software GSS21sx V20 which supports connections with open systems. In September 2019, IBM launched the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/hardware">IBM Z15 </a>showcasing key capabilities such as encryption anywhere, cloud native development, and instant recovery.&nbsp; From many conversations with CIO's in healthcare, travel, financial services, and pharma, the mainframe continues to play a key role in their overall modernization strategies.&nbsp; For many of these organizations, they are working with public cloud vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud while keeping their intense workloads on the mainframe for both cost and security reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, many competitive industry leaders value a hybrid approach with cloud and mainframe as a trusted, efficient architecture for their enterprise organizations delivering intense hybrid workloads from securely filing a healthcare claim, making life-saving prescriptions, booking travel, initiating a credit check, and reducing fraud in banking online.&nbsp; A hybrid approach enables top businesses to apply the right technologies to the right workloads to reduce their risk.&nbsp; Why? Elasticity, distributed compute and storage, and shared infrastructure have continued to withstand the test of time.&nbsp; As the CIO of a Fortune 50 financial services entity noted, "The security, performance, reliability, and value equation of the mainframe give us confidence to continue with our hybrid approach.&nbsp; The cost of data movement and I/O costs would be punishingly expensive with our current public cloud contracts"</p>

<p>Moreover, investments by organizations such as Broadcom and IBM's in Zowe, the open mainframe project, enable all users to access an integrated and extensible open source framework for z/OS.&nbsp; Users can use one language to access open systems and open software through a set of common APIs and OS capabilities.&nbsp; Consequently, developers can use the same tools for the cloud and mainframe enabling a broader set of developers and resources to work on both.&nbsp; The numbers show this as well with 94 of the top 100 IBM Z Enterprises are running Linux on Z and able to modernize with the mainframe.&nbsp; In addition, a 2019 survey of mainframe professionals conducted by Forrester for IBM showed that nearly 90% of professionals in enterprise computing careers agree the job market for their skill set is growing, and 75% believe there is a high demand for their skills in mainframe.</p>



<p>The growth of mainframe adoption has come at the same time the public cloud has expanded.&nbsp; Constellation estimates that 20% of the world's workloads are now in the public cloud.&nbsp; As adoption continues, co-existence of mainframe, on-premises, and cloud deployments will continue for at least the next decade.&nbsp; In a 2020 Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/hello-mainframe-our-old-friend.html">survey</a> also confirmed that mainframe usage continues to grow with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>74% believe the mainframe has a long-term viability as a strategic platform for their organizations</li>
	<li>91% identified expanding their mainframe footprints as a moderate or critical priority in the next 12 months</li>
	<li>72% are planning upgrades to their mainframe in the next three years</li>
</ul>

<p>While public cloud usage has gained ground, hybrid cloud approaches have become mainstream among top organizations.&nbsp; Many business and technology leaders have expanded and grown their existing investments in mainframe for their critical next gen computing environments. In fact, businesses rely on both the cloud and mainframe to lead digital transformation efforts built on trust to achieve peace of mind, with speed, security, versatility, elasticity, and scale on demand in a hybrid environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As leaders move forward, they should focus on getting the most out of their cloud and mainframe investments to improve organizational ROI.&nbsp; Modernizing on the mainframe can be done in concert with distributed and cloud platforms.&nbsp; Balancing out data gravity and I/O costs will determine which technology to place transactional processing and critical workloads.&nbsp; In the meantime, teams can easily use the same tools and standards such as open source across all platforms including mainframe.&nbsp; Form always follows function and tech decisions must match the business use case.&nbsp; Constellation expects mainframe to play not only a key role for decades to come, but also to expand its footprint in the overall technology and business strategy of leading organizations.</p>

					<br><h2>Welcome to geezer town, junior.</h2>
<p>While researching my recent article, “<a title="Article on Age Discrimination by yours truly" href="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/04/20/age-discrimination-and-programming-jobs/" target="_self">Age discrimination and Programming Jobs</a>”&nbsp;, I discovered a <a title="NYT Article: &quot;Now Hiring, if you're young.&quot;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/opinion/now-hiring-if-you-re-young.html" target="_blank">1998 Op-Ed piece from The New York Times</a>&nbsp;that cited some startling statistics from the NSF and Census bureau about the longevity of a software engineering career.</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]ix years after finishing college, 57 percent of computer science graduates are working as programmers; at 15 years the figure drops to 34 percent, and at 20 years — when most are still only in their early 40’s — it is down to 19 percent. In contrast, the figures for civil engineering are 61 percent, 52 percent and 52 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p><img data-attachment-id="677" data-permalink="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/retiredprogrammer/" data-orig-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg" data-orig-size="210,210" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RetiredProgrammerButton" data-image-description="<p>Retired programmer button</p>
" data-medium-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=210" data-large-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=210" title="RetiredProgrammerButton" src="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=468" alt="RetiredProgrammerButton" srcset="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg 210w, https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px">I find the defensive tone of the article and the use of dubious sampling of only computer science graduates to support its conclusion undermines its credibility. In a lot of ways, the Government has been very slow to grok the software engineering trade. In this study it completely ignores the significant number of working programmers who either earned their degree in another discipline or never finished college.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Still, smart money seems to concur that the software engineer depreciates only slightly more slowly than the machine he or she toils behind as exemplified in this 1996 comment from <a title="Craig Barrett Bio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Barrett_(businessman)" target="_blank">Craig Barrett</a>, then President and Co-founder of Intel.</p>
<blockquote><p>The half-life of an engineer, software or hardware, is only a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, the guy’s a suit, but more importantly he was (at the time) a 57 year old former engineer publicly reinforcing the discriminatory notion of expiration dates on other engineers. It’s scary as hell to think that such an influential industry insider thinks that a programming career is roughly the same as a professional basketball player’s.</p>

<h2>My take on the issue</h2>
<p>Considerable accusatory ink has been dedicated to the age discrimination problem in technology, but I suspect it may be an inevitable consequence of the rapid pace of change that defines this field.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The market value of an employee is primarily determined by experience in technologies relevant to the employer.</li>
<li>Software engineering reliably undergoes a major technology shift at least every 10 years.</li>
<li>While a technology shift doesn’t completely negate the skills of veterans, it certainly levels the playing field for recent grads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a prospective hiring manager using a newer technology like Ruby on Rails for which nobody other than <a title="Creator of Rails" href="http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html" target="_blank">David Heinemeier</a>has more than about 5 years of experience. &nbsp;Sure, that extra 10 years of C++ experience is a positive differentiator for the veteran over the upstart with the same 3 years of Rails experience.&nbsp; All things equal you’d naturally hire the guy with more total experience.</p>
<p>However, all things are NOT equal. Those 10 years of C++ experience made the veteran candidate progressively more expensive as they leveraged the value of that experience in jobs requiring C++. The problem is that the marginal utility of that extra experience must exceed the marginal cost of hiring the veteran to justify paying the premium.</p>
<p>Herein is the source of the problem. The more irrelevant experience a candidate has, the more lopsided the utility/value equation becomes, and this presumes that the manager even has the luxury of paying extra to get that experience.</p>
<p>Even if the veteran prices himself competitively with a younger candidate, the hiring manager has to consider the implications of bringing in someone taking a big pay cut. Will they have morale issues from day one? Are they going to change their mind after a month that they really do need that extra cash and leave? It’s a sticky situation.</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that unlike other forms of discrimination that are more arbitrary and capricious, age discrimination can often be a result of objective and sound business justifications. I’m not trying to justify it as an acceptable practice, but just trying to describe the pickle it puts the manager in trying to make a sound business decision without compromising the ethical and legal obligations of the company.</p>
<h2>So what’s your plan B?</h2>
<p>Assuming you aren’t fabulously wealthy, accepted to clown college, or the fatal victim of a Red-bull induced heart attack by 40 a mitigation strategy is in order. Here are some viable options.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="678" data-permalink="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/chooseadventure/" data-orig-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg" data-orig-size="190,310" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chooseadventure" data-image-description="<p>Choose Your Adventure Book Cover- The Cave of Time</p>

<h3>Work for the one person who would never discriminate against you.</h3>
<p>No. Not your mother. You! If you aren’t the entrepreneurial type, consider a consultancy. For some reason that I don’t completely get, a little gray hair and a smattering of experience in different technologies can create a beneficial bias for companies when they are renting brains instead of buying them outright. It may have something to do with the tendency for consultants to be vetted from higher up in the management chain where the silver foxes live.</p>



<h3>Give in to the dark side and go into management.</h3>
<p>I’d argue that a career in programming does precious little to prepare someone for management, but clearly management thinks that everyone including technologists harbors a deep longing to “graduate” into their ranks. I think it a fallacy that no one would continue to design and build software for 20 years unless they had no ambition or growth potential. However, people like me that respect such dedication to the craft are in the minority. Maybe it is best to just stop fighting it, but consider the following before taking the plunge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid-level managers often make very little more, if not the same as high level engineers.</li>
<li>It gets progressively harder to keep up with new technology because you don’t work directly with it.</li>
<li>Meetings, politics and dealing with unrealistic requests will pretty much become your life.</li>
<li>You may try to avoid it, but management-speak will creep into your vocabulary (did you notice my “paradigm” comment earlier?)</li>
<li>Even when it isn’t your fault, it’s your fault.</li>
<li>Even when you make it succeed, your team should get the credit.</li>
<li>Being the wunderkind as a technologist is much easier to do in technology than management, you’ll have to check your ego at the door.</li>
<li>You will be forced to make decisions that affect people’s personal life (pay, bonus, firing, etc.) and this is hard to stomach sometimes.</li>
<li>It is very empowering, enjoyable to be able to set the agenda and sometimes say, “No. We ain’t doing that shit.”</li>
<li>Computers are predictable, people are complicated. You will eventually fantasize about robot employees.</li>
<li>Mentoring can be very rewarding, but also very challenging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The most difficult thing in the world is to know how to do a thing and to watch someone else do it wrong without comment.<br>
-Theodore H. White.</p></blockquote>
<h3>You’ve got a cash cow, milk that sucker!</h3>
<p>I know you love programming because you like technology, so this may go against your very nature, but no one says you’ve got to jump every time some snot-nosed kid invents a new way to run byte-code. You have invested a lot of time and energy mastering the technology you use, and your experience differentiates you. Money follows scarcity, and snow-birding on an older technology, if you can stomach it, may just be the way to protect your earning potential. The industry turns on a dime, but is slow to retire proven technology. It is highly likely that you will still be able to earn some decent coin in the technology you know and love even after a few decades.</p>

                            <h2>Corporate Strategy at Scale: Emerging Thinking on How Companies and Economies Evolve</h2>

<div><p>
One of the key leadership dimensions required in our increasingly dynamic business and economic environment is a sound understanding of the big picture. Shrinking product lifecycles and corporate lifespans make it essential for those in charge of bringing to market the innovations of tomorrow to widen and extend their horizons further into the future. This course introduces a novel way of understanding how businesses and economies, as complex systems of unique business spaces, evolve and interrelate over long periods of time. It is a holistic perspective that allows us to define and analyze emerging behaviors that cannot be determined simply by examining each system part in isolation.</p><p>

In this course, we will learn about (1) a new theory of needs and value; (2) commoditization and innovation as the two fundamental forces that shape the business and economic environment; (3) the foundation of lasting corporate success—an alignment between a company’s intent and its actual approach to business; and (4) an economy’s natural behavior and its impact on the society. We will discuss examples from such companies as Apple and IBM, and will review and reassess some established and popular theoretical concepts. The framework will provide those in product management or product marketing with a valuable new tool for positioning new products, motivating teams, and crafting successful strategies.</p><u>Guest Speakers</u><p> include:</p><u>April 15</u><p>: "<strong>Science Fiction as a Business Tool</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerspitz/" target="_blank">Roger Spitz</a></strong>, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Techistential</p><u>April 22</u><p>: "<strong>Understanding Needs in Emerging Markets</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/business/profiles/srini_venugopal" target="_blank">Srinivas Venugopal</a></strong>, Assistant Professor of Marketing at&nbsp;University of Vermont</p><u>April 29</u><p>: "<strong>Strategic Cartography: Mapping Tech Product Expansions</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitmerker/" target="_blank">Kit Merker</a></strong>, Chief Operating Officer at&nbsp;Nobl9</p><u>May 6</u><p>: "<strong>Market Segmentation as a Key Success Driver in a Fast-Changing World</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-whelan-a280b113/" target="_blank">Jennifer Whelan</a></strong>, Vice President and Head of B2B Marketing at Verizon Media</p><u>May 20</u><p>: "<strong>Complexity Trade-Offs in Companies and Economies</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-siegenfeld/" target="_blank">Alexander Siegenfeld</a></strong>, Graduate Student Researcher at New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) and MIT Media Lab</p><u>May 27</u><p>:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akvaal/" target="_blank">Andrew Kvaal</a></strong>, Chief Operating Officer at Ampion, Inc.</p></div>

        <p>I really don't.&nbsp; I mean I guess it's because part of me just feels 
like writing.&nbsp; I don't talk to too many people, so this is sort of my 
way of expressing myself.&nbsp; And when I do talk to people I generally 
don't say much, I just listen and ask questions.&nbsp; I don't feel my life 
is anything but ordinary, although I guess it is rather spectacular.&nbsp; I 
mean it is life after all, and I once heard that all the dead wish for 
is to be alive.<br></p><p>Not even sure why I feel the need to express 
what it is I'm thinking anyways.&nbsp; It's rather futile and meaningless.&nbsp; 
Among other things I also don't care if anyone even reads this, nor do I
 expect anyone too.&nbsp; It's almost like talking to yourself in the shower 
when no one is in the room.<br></p><p>Feels nice.</p><p>Although, I 
guess from an outsiders point of view, it might look a bit foolish.&nbsp; A 
man just rambling about nothing.&nbsp; Could be soothing I suppose, the 
distraction from your own thoughts, into the world of some one else's. 
The liberty to lose yourself, and end up in the imagination of someone 
else.&nbsp; If it's a well enough written piece, it might even spark an 
emotion, or a laugh.&nbsp; Maybe even chuckle. Unfortunately, that's not what
 you're getting today.</p><p>You're stuck with this, a rambling.<br></p><p>There
 was this one time I was just sitting there looking outside, and I 
imagined a squirrel.&nbsp; I'm sure there was probably a squirrel near by, 
but I didn't see it, so I had to imagine one.&nbsp; Granted what I imagined I
 don't think any squirrel would do, at least currently. &nbsp;</p><p>It held a
 concerto.&nbsp; It walked on stage, this imaginary stage, and started to 
conduct one of the most amazing pieces of compositions ever imagined, by
 pigeons.&nbsp; The rats of the sky.</p><p>As they flew and frolicked through
 the melody of his rhythm, it all started to fall into place.&nbsp; I would 
say I was escaping what ever it is I was doing to enjoy this, but in 
reality I had nothing to escape, I was sitting in silence with company.</p><p>Not
 sure why it was a squirrel I imagined either.&nbsp; Probably had something 
to do with the fact that another time I was sitting in silence, I saw an
 actual squirrel trying to get some from some other squirrel.&nbsp; It 
actually managed to score.</p><p>The simple things in life.&nbsp; </p><p>Now I
 probably shouldn't even publish this, I mean for all it's frankness 
it's simply yet another waste of space.&nbsp; Although it is a space that I 
enjoy wasting.&nbsp; I guess one of these days I should write something of 
value or sustenance.&nbsp; Perhaps even of use.&nbsp; </p><p>I'd probably be 
getting ahead of myself at that point though, as most things I say lack 
value, and are too light to have sustenance.&nbsp; Yet here we are.&nbsp; It's 
almost like reading a bad book, you keep turning the pages in hopes you 
will find that nugget of wisdom.</p><p>But alas it wont come, I will 
instead just torture your poor thoughts with more fluff.&nbsp; Not because I 
want too, but because I feel I must.&nbsp; Why I feel that is unknown to me, 
yet I keep writing.&nbsp; I could go down some rabbit hole of why or how you 
could do something, but that would be no fun.&nbsp; It would simply be 
literal.</p><p>Plus the poor rabbit would probably be upset you are in 
his hole.&nbsp; He would probably scream some obscenities to us anyways for 
intruding in it's hole.&nbsp; How would we even make it down this hole, I'm a
 human, and most rabbits are tiny, so I guess it would have to be some 
sort of hybrid rabbit human hole.&nbsp; I also don't even know your 
dimensions, what if you're a giant, or a spec.&nbsp; Would it even work, or 
would the hole collapse on it's self by us just being in it's presence.</p><p>Would
 the rabbit even be a he? Could be a female rabbit you know, which would
 make the intrusion that much worse.&nbsp; Not because gender plays any role 
in this rabbit hole, but because rabbit holes rhyme with foes.&nbsp; Which 
the lady rabbit would definitely consider us.&nbsp; So I guess it would be 
best to go down a manhole instead.</p><p>But the acoustics wouldn't be 
as good for the squirrel concerto.&nbsp; What a pity, because that reality 
was starting to pigeonhole me.&nbsp; Then again it's easy to throw anything 
into a hole.&nbsp; The problem turns out to be catching what ever you threw 
in before it unrolls.&nbsp; Thankfully we got rock and roll instead</p>

      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Estimating_total_knowledge_in_the_brain">Estimating total knowledge in the brain</span></h2>
<p>I am finally closer to being able to say how much knowledge a human brain can hold. Scientists have counted the number of synapses in the human brain (above 100 trillion), and came up with staggering numbers on brain capacity. However, in real life, we see the brain as an unreliable and forgetful device. For an average student, to learn 100 new French words for an exam is an effort. To memorize 45,000 words of English in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_English" title="Advanced English">Advanced English</a> collection is a feat very few achieved for the cost in time. In other words, trillions of synapses seem to contradict our struggles with mere thousands of questions we need to know to function effectively on a daily basis.
</p>
<h2><span id="SuperMemo_estimates">SuperMemo estimates</span></h2>
<p>30 years ago, using simulations of the learning process in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, I predicted that I will not see a human memorize a million <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a>. Today, even a million seems like a super-optimistically high number.
</p><p><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> makes estimates easy. We can count individual questions and answers, and worry less how many bits of information get stored in the brain. The estimates are pretty inaccurate to evaluate the totality of knowledge. For example, I once computed that I am able to recognize around 30,000 human faces without even trying. Some knowledge flows in effortlessly. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> measures harder knowledge that we want to preserve due to its high value.
</p><p>For 32 years now, I have been using SuperMemo to control what knowledge I remember with high recall. In those three decades, there were a couple of breakthroughs where I could sense a significant acceleration or an increase to the quality of learning. In particular, the arrival of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> in 1999 and the employment of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue" title="Priority queue">priority queue</a> in 2006 were such booster events. However, the total number of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a> in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a> is not a true reflection of knowledge. In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, the tolerance for knowledge overload increases, and the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue" title="Priority queue">priority queue</a> makes it possible to focus on top priority <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a>, while neglecting lesser knowledge. In other words, we can perfectly know a smaller set of items, and know a huge set of items more superficially. The only good reflection of knowledge would be to consider the probability of recall for all individual items.

<h2><span id="Adding_up_memory_retrievability">Adding up memory retrievability</span></h2>
<p>With the new <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</a> algorithm, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17" title="Algorithm SM-17">Algorithm SM-17</a> (2015), we can finally take a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition_history" title="Repetition history">repetition history</a> of each <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">item</a> and estimate the chance of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Recall" title="Recall">recall</a> at any point in time with pretty good accuracy. The last tool missing in the box was a chance to take any point in time (a date), and run the estimate for all items in the entire <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a> (e.g. <i>"How much did I know on Jan 1, 2000?"</i>). The only problem with such estimates is that they are computationally expensive. Finally, in 2020, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_18" title="SuperMemo 18">SuperMemo 18</a> makes it possible to chose a selected number of time points in the lifetime of any <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a>, and run total knowledge estimates. For any date, the total knowledge estimate is the sum of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_retrievability" title="Memory retrievability">memory retrievability</a> estimates for that given point in time.
</p>
<p>Total knowledge can be estimated by adding up <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_retrievability" title="Memory retrievability">memory retrievability</a> for all individual items</p>
<h2><span id="Longitudinally_largest_data_set">Longitudinally largest data set</span></h2>
<p>I safely hold the record for the longest continuous use of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</a> (over 32 years at the moment of writing). I will keep the title as long as I keep learning. I was simply the first to start (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo" title="Birth of SuperMemo">Birth of SuperMemo</a>). I hope to keep going as long as health permits. This is why my own collection is the best source of data today to make lifelong learning estimates (Jan 1, 2020). 
</p><p>There was a minor problem on the way however. Full record of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition_history" title="Repetition history">repetition history</a> was kept only as of 1996 (due to costs and limitations on the available storage in the late 1980s). Seemingly, this might make the first 9 year of data unreliable. However, SuperMemo can provide a reasonable simulation of repetition histories for items with a known number of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Lapse" title="Lapse">lapses</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition" title="Repetition">repetitions</a>, and the last <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval" title="Interval">interval</a>. Those simulations cut the 9 years to roughly 6-7 years, and are accurate enough to make an imperceptible difference to the final outcome unless a major incongruity hides in that early period. I bet my right hand this is not the case. I was easily able to learn at 10,000 items per year in the early years, but total <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a> estimates cut this number substantially.
</p><p>I split my 32 years of learning into 60 equal intervals and let the computational procedure run overnight. In the morning, I had a beautiful graph that I want to share for the new year 2020. The staggering conclusion is that all my perceptions about acceleration, slow downs, improved learning, or neglect were largely illusory. For 32 years, I kept building up knowledge at a remarkably steady rate. In the early years, the effort seemed a bit harder, I needed more self-discipline, there were outstanding items, long days of repetitions, etc. In the times of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> it all turn out to be fun, learning with pleasure, and learning on demand, i.e. learning mostly for a specific purpose when I needed new knowledge. My departure into unrelated areas of learning proceeded at leisurely pace. With all those seeming upheavals and changes, hardly any kink shows up in the graph. Many people misread that observation as a disappointment with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. Metaphorically speaking, I am only surprised with the smooth ride of the rocket. The speed is no less fantastic.

<h2><span id="Conceptualization_process">Conceptualization process</span></h2>
<p>To make a good estimate of maximum human knowledge, we need to have data that would span a 100 years period. This is how long an average human might live given a perfect lifestyle, good health, and a couple of other conditions. My 32 years of learning fall into the most uneventful period that is characterized by steady linear progress. In theory, the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization" title="Conceptualization">conceptualization</a> process in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a> of the brain should begin slowly. It might possibly saturate when the ceiling of the brain size is reached. Those early and late changes in the speed of conceptualization will be reflected in the underlying speed of learning. This is illustrated in the figure with the light blue line marked as computational <b>Capacity</b>:

<h2><span id="Combining_data_from_many_users">Combining data from many users</span></h2>
<p>To make a good estimate I would need data from many users. In particular, the first 10 years of life, and the data past the age of 80 are most precious. We have surprisingly many users in those age categories, but all users learn at different speeds, use different strategies, learn different things, etc. This is why we need collections that span a decade or more. Short periods cannot be collated from many collections because they are largely uninformative. Regrettably, I have hundreds of collections submitted in various circumstances, and they mostly come from young or middle aged users. They also predominantly come from novices. To this day, I do not have any data from users above the age of 80.
</p><p>I was hoping that my own data might hint if the fifth decade of life brings some slowdown to the learning process. However, my data has been polluted with a great deal of self-experimentation. To account for artifacts of experimental learning, I needed extra correction procedures. In the end, depending on the method, I received a different verdict. My learning might have slowed down a bit, or it might have actually accelerated (my unreliable perception leans towards the latter).
</p><p>By combining data from collections of users at different ages I arrived at a hypothetical course of learning in a lifetime. Unfortunately, the projected slowdown after 70 is just a hypothesis. I tried to imagine myself in a wheelchair at 100, and the mere loss of mobility, I imagine, would undermine my ability to progress with learning at the present rate. I have no data to prove the slowdown. It is just a common sense speculation and my best guess based on four decades of analysis and deliberations on the nature of learning.

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi

        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();
</span>    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and, again, let’s see <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tEJICcpLegAyeWpgByxgEaZiIAGykADqgWE6rR6hiaCfgFqdHYOzkZuHt5KKlG0DATMxAQhxqYWisqYqkHpmQQxTq7uXooZWTlhnLVlFXEJXgCUiqgGxMgcAORSAMz2yIZYANTiwzrICgT49DPY4gAMAILrGwvEBqqTAGpFktMA7LKbk9eT9gSe3AD6BJMAHjOXGze39A/PkwBPD7bb4AN1QeHQkywLgMwAACsQ7hAOpM0LQFsDNuIzgARLFbTZ3P4vWgkIwMACOBkymHQEGOyFOoNROM%2BYIAdDC4YjkR0Cd9iJgCL1aJNQRzXpMAFTiyXTGRygEypUEnG4gZdVggAYAVgGpFMAzWBtQOp0cjkkwUPT6mAVw04BoIOpNHS6AGsQMNhhyff6A4HvNqBtwDUaTaQzQMDQoQGtSC7jZrSHBYEg0EYfHh2GQKBBM9ncyhhKJOJw1k0qDmCO44xAXK6DS57JkATqnaRM0YtAQAPK0Vjt5OkLBGETAdhN0d4IXFUGYOMjzCvIoGWsdg13ZSboR4FzENt6LC7ghIoybro0ehMNgcHj8QSlsSWmR7lxxyBdVA%2BVJLgC0fbDJM/4LOgMy4hIMhyJIkbJEUqSaNoDSmE01itFUHhNBEgR0Ch4T%2BLhtAYfE1RNPBxR0KU9T6LkggUak1HlPYlSkVhzQ0aEqEccxsSYVwXQ2r0/QCUIOr6oa07Rq8AAcnj/g8aLPpM5YcmsHKcJMEC4IQJAOk0kx6FmObuPpqIWtBMjOk27qkF6Pp%2BoGTk%2BsGOphpJI7RrG8aJjZqYwIgKCoMZubkJQhYmR44wTuWlakNWrC1sQ9aNiOLa0G2u7dr2A5DtOY4TlOI74HOagLkukYrmuG4DJ224hpGrD7oexAAsegyRmeeAXrVKbXowLBTg%2BAiSEIE4oK%2B8hNR%2B8Dfr%2BQQAUBIFgRBUGyDIsGxoUlGmBA1j4Zwo3oSxbRkcMviEakB2jThqQke0nDnQxJR1NktGNKNz1Ua991nTx108b9WHDIJtoiZwWrieGUk6rJ8mKdFogqZwakaVpOlEMQ%2BmkIZwVFqZIySOZk3Wcmtn2b6znOWJobQ55OreQmSZupDAySHTkZeb5ZNdAuyVBCA3BAA">the generated assembly</a>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>subq</span>    <span>$24</span>, %rsp

        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In addition to the obvious call to <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>, we have
some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function
epilogue</a>),
and then return to our caller with <code>retq</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a different example. Suppose that we want to print
an uppercased C string and we’d like to avoid heap allocations for
smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I don’t normally enjoy writing controversial posts about why new technologies are bad; I LOVE it! So here we go! We’re starting a new large-scale first-party project over at <a href="https://themadbotter.com/">The Mad Botter</a> (sorry no details today) that requires a significant level of low-level engineering work on Linux.  Initially, we considered using some sort of solution like CYthon to compile Python to native code, but we ultimately decided against it. That led us to look at compiled languages.  Spoiler alert! We went with C++.  Before you flip your lid, here’s why. </p>



<p><strong>Multiple Platforms / Native Code</strong>:  Sure, I’ve spent a lot of energy trying to find cross-platform solutions that work well and the solution I came to is that are always compromises that aren’t the ones that I care to make; with that said, there’s a lot of good reasons to go with more traditionally write once run everywhere solutions. C++ allows us to have shared code (with some platform specific modifications to be sure)  compiled  for each of our desired platforms while also having specific modules to take advantage platform specific features.  A key point here is that by platforms we are not just talking about operating systems but also processor architectures; I’m looking at you Apple Silicon</p>



<p><strong>Modern C++:</strong> Over the last few releases C++ has seen some changes that aim to sand down some of the rougher edges of the language. Collections and memory management have been getting a lot of good attention in the last few releases. In particular, we found smart pointers to be particularly attractive; dare I say they are downright familiar at least on their face to this Objective-C die-hard fan; yes, I am still pining for my square brackets!</p>



<p><strong>Team Familiarity: </strong>OK, so this is a bit of a weak one in terms of technical reasons, but it’s actually pretty important. Compared to the competing low-level languages (Go and Rust), all of the team has at least some experience in C++ with some of us having quite a bit of experience in the language. While it shouldn’t drive all technical decisions, experience is a factor. </p>



<p>Before landing on C++ we ended up with three languages in the running at the end of the process: C++, C# (.Net) and Rust. C# was eliminated first for a few reasons including some extra hoops to work in it on Linux and macOS; having said that, .Net is much easier to develop in on Linux and macOS now than it ever was before. Rust almost took the cup and <a href="https://coder.show/">Coder Radio</a> listeners will know I am a Rust fan, but ultimately the existing C++ experience on the team carried the day and like a vinyl record collection at a hipster swap-meet, it’s golden.  Let me know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/dominucco">Twitter</a> and if you’re in need of Python, IOT or mobile development, reach out! A</p>

<![CDATA[The Meta-Creator Ceiling]]>

<p><em><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/05ccbc28">Listen to narrated version</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How many should be teaching people how to succeed instead of just succeeding in their own way?</strong></p>
<p>As independent creators carve out a new career path for themselves, I suspect that some are unintentionally picking a path that limits their growth and robs the world of their true potential.</p>
<p>This theory was triggered by this Hunter Walk tweet:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s1btlni3fe2mzxhghkm6.png" alt="Hunter Walk: the emerging newsletter playbook seems to be &quot;B-Players Writing About A-Players While Being Subscribed to by C-Players&quot;">
</p>
<p>The message is clear: By doing B player things, you are at least doing better than C players. <strong>But you will <em>never</em> be an A player using the B player playbook.</strong></p>
<p>Is that a tradeoff you are consciously making?</p>
<p>Of course it is too reductive to reduce pluripotent people to "A players" and "B players". You can be both in different domains, or transition from one to the other. And of course this is nowhere near as bad as the real-life "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ceiling">glass ceiling</a>" or a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling">bamboo ceiling</a>" in normal careers, where a certain set of the workforce is unable to progress by sheer fact of <em>who they are</em>. That is obviously despicable and is a far more important societal issue.</p>
<p>But the meta-creator ceiling is interesting to me because it is a path that new creators <strong>follow by choice,</strong> yet <em>without being aware of it's limitations</em> because nobody is incentivized to warn them. Perhaps because it is an easier game than others, or perhaps because of hype and marketing.</p>
<p>No judgment — I of all people know that there are many ways to avoid asking what it is I really want to do with my life.</p>
<p>Perhaps some definitions are in order: <strong>A "Meta-Creator" is someone who creates content about creating, instead of just creating.</strong></p>
<p>The temptation toward being a Meta-Creator is extremely high. There are three paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The A-B-C Loop</strong>: People want success porn. They are oblivious to the <a href="https://medium.com/@coffeeandjunk/cognitive-bias-narrative-fallacy-9cff93a597b2">narrative fallacy</a> and ignore luck and complicating details. Your success creating success porn gains you access to more successful people who are only too happy to let you write their hagiography. You can spend an entire career mythologizing successful people, living a life of a bard rather than a hero. Always the vibesmaid, never the vibe.</li>
  <li><strong>The Creator Strange Loop:</strong> To <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1349361401316446211?s=20">quote the always-brilliant Philip Kiely</a>: "First you do X, then you make content about doing X, then you make content about that content... One day you realize you haven't done X for six months. And there is only so much room for content at the highest levels of abstraction." Every single step makes logical sense because you have credibility from having just done the thing. After a while every step you take you wind back up at the same spot because you're in the generic Creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop">strange loop</a> everyone has pigeonholed you in.</li>
  <li><strong>The Audience-Building Loop:</strong> The natural end game of the current <strong>Audience-First</strong> and <strong>Build in Public</strong> memes is that you naturally attract an audience of wannabe builders. There are only so many topics they want to buy, and so many things to incestuously sell to each other. The successful cohorts will be supported by the far bigger unsuccessful ones in a self-organizing pyramid scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be extremely clear: You can be enormously successful and happy being a Meta-Creator, and bring success and happiness to millions, and that is no small feat. I enjoy Tim Ferris' podcasts and Tren Griffin's blogposts. No judgment if that's your thing. The economics make sense too — in a gold rush, go mine a bit of gold, then sell copies of the shovel you used because it is now proven to work. Just don't spend too long thinking about <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1284597930398105600?s=20">who arranged those economics in the first place</a>.</p>
<p>But, one, you may have a lower chance of success pursuing this path than others, because it is both available to everyone and zero-sum.</p>
<p>But I write for reason two: the sneaking suspicion that <em>even if you win</em> and are top of the heap at the Meta-Creator game, you are still limiting yourself from what you could be doing with your life. What the people you <em>actually</em> look up to are doing with theirs. What the world could be benefiting from if the greatest minds of our generation just applied themselves to other problems than "How to Crush it on Twitter" or "Get a Million YouTube Subscribers" or the 3923rd "How Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Think" blogpost.</p>
<p>Smart, capable people like you and I can often approach life with more ambition than direction. We want success more than we want to solve problems. I think the way to approach the question of "what do I do to be successful", may be to flip it on its head:</p>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

            <!-- What are the features of lit -->
            <h2>Features of this tool</h2><p>
            Literate works with any programming language, generates HTML as output (<a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">which can be converted to pdf</a>),
            and generates readable code. The code that is generated is indented properly and is automatically commented using the titles you have written
            for the code blocks.</p><p>
            Here is the full list of features:</p><ul>
                <li>Supports any language including syntax highlighting and pretty printing in HTML</li>
                <li>Generates HTML as output</li>
                <li>Generates readable code and commented in the target language</li>
                <li>Reports syntax errors back from the compiler to the right line in the literate source</li>
                <li>Runs fast -- wc.lit compiled for me in 7ms for both code and html output</li>
                <li>Markdown based -- very easy to read and write Literate source.</li>
                <li>Automatically generates hyperlinks between code sections</li>
                <li>Formatted output similar to CWEB</li>
                <li>Creates an index with identifiers used (you need to have exuberant or universal ctags installed to use this feature)</li>
                <li>Supports TeX equations with <code>$</code> notation</li>
                <li>Compatible with Vim (<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim" target="_blank">literate.vim</a>)</li>
                <li>Highly customizable</li>
            </ul><p>
            
            You can get started by taking a look at the <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/literate/manual.html">manual</a>.
            In addition, this website is made with Literate, and the source can be viewed

<p>On day one of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/09/lessons-learned-on-an-engineering-manager-job-search/">my new job</a>, my manager tried to warn me:</p>



<blockquote><p>You’re going to struggle with imposter syndrome on this team. I struggled with it. Everyone does. It’s a part of the job.</p></blockquote>



<p>I didn’t believe him. I brushed it off with a self-deprecating joke about my enormous ego. And for the first month or so, I was fine. But then I wasn’t. </p>



<p>Imposter syndrome is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">sneaky son of a bitch</a>. It took me another month to realize that’s what I was feeling. </p>



<p>In hindsight, it should have been obvious. I didn’t pay any attention to the good stuff. A <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a> team member or a piece of positive feedback was happenstance and good luck, obviously. That all would have happened even if I didn’t join, obviously. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Any manager</a> in my shoes would have done that, obviously.</p>



<p>But whenever I found a scrap of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">negativity</a> or unhappiness or <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">disagreement</a>, my brain said “AHA! I knew it! Told ya chump, you don’t belong here!” That went on until today, when I was writing a stream of consciousness post. I realized mid-sentence that this is good old fashioned imposter syndrome. It’s so stereotypical that it’s downright boring.</p>



<p>But the tricky bit is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">breaking the cycle</a>, because it’s self-fulfilling. Here’s how it goes down for me:</p>



<ul><li>Step 1: Feel like an imposter</li><li>Step 2: Feel the urge to earn respect and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">be liked</a> to prove that I’m not an imposter</li><li>Step 3: Try to please everyone rather than pushing for <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">what I think is best</a> which may upset people </li><li>Step 4: Come across as wishy washy and inexperienced</li><li>Step 5: Notice that, and go back to step 1.</li></ul>



<p>By feeling like an imposter, I end up acting like one. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">We become what we are told we are</a>, and I told myself that I’m an imposter.</p>



<p>I have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/01/making-success-controllable/">kill step 3</a>. Please excuse me while I hype myself up to do that:</p>



<ul><li>I’ve been on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/02/whats-in-a-team-name/">dozens of teams</a> over the past 13 years. </li><li>I’ve <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/08/becoming-a-leader-the-hard-and-only-way/">led most of them</a>, and they’ve all been successful.</li><li>People usually like me OK, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/11/who-cares-if-youre-liked/">it’s ok if some don’t</a>.</li><li>And a lame appeal to authority: I’ve read <em>so many books</em> about this stuff.</li></ul>



<p>I know what I’m doing. The only way to <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/18/consistency-beats-quality/">break the cycle</a> is to go do it. </p>

<p>I got a chance to deeply learn about OSS (Open Source Software) while I was doing my Master's degree in 2016. I've been researching open source development since then, and I fell in love with its collaborative nature and the way of writing and using software. Since then, I've been advocating for open source projects, and supporting the OSS community in many different ways. What strikes me the most about open source development is that its collaborative nature allows innovation at a fast pace and I believe that it can result in many future discoveries.</p>
<p>Although open source is very popular now, it has been defined as an actual term in the late 70's and early 80's. For those who are not familiar with the term, open source is a technology development and distribution model, where everything is done in public - from setting a roadmap to develop new features, fix bugs, code review to source code, to name a few. Normally, there is a governing board, usually formed by hobbyists, a company, or a foundation, that publicly manages the project.</p>
<p>Open source is everywhere! From the smallest embedded systems to the computers, cellphones, and infrastructure of the companies we engage with every day.  When you stream Netflix on your home, for example, you fire up Amazon web services, most of which run on Linux, one of the biggest open source projects. If you have an Android cellphone, then you use Linux in your everyday life. Despite that, many applications in the next generation of technology are open source. For example, Google open sourced its artificial intelligence engine called TensorFlow in 2015.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, open source is now embraced by big tech companies. For example, IBM plans to pay $34 billion for the open source company Red Hat, and Microsoft paid $7.5 billion to acquire the code hosting and collaboration platform GitHub. Finally, Walmart has just released its own open source software [1].</p>
<p><strong>So, at this point, you might be asking yourself why would a company open source their projects?</strong></p>
<p>For a lot of reasons. Let's take the aforementioned Tensorflow as an example. When Google open sourced Tensorflow, it not only enabled companies, researchers, and hobbyists to build applications using the technology the tech giant uses to do translation tasks, for example, but also to have outside developers to make their software better and adapt it to each person's needs. Currently, more than 1,300 developers outside Google have worked on TensorFlow.</p>
<p>And in this case, what is the advantage of open sourcing Tensorflow? It's pretty simple! By open sourcing the tool, Google helped TensorFlow to become one of the standard frameworks for developing AI applications, which can boost other tech fields that depend on AI. Additionally, open source serves as valuable marketing. After Google has open sourced Tensorflow, Dropbox and Airbnb have used TensorFlow to recognize text in documents and photographs.</p>
<p>Another example is the Chinese tech giant Tencent that has open sourced its microservices framework TARS. TARS now is an open source foundation and it is helping to build a strong community of microservice open source software. After TARS has become open source, not only has TARS grown in terms of the number of functionalities developed by developers all over the world, but it has also helped the project to attract and retain technical talent.</p>
<p>I hope that at this stage I have convinced you the many advantages when open sourcing a software project. So, let's take a look at the main reasons why you should either open source your project, use open source software or contribute to open source development.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor neutrality</strong><br>
Open source software enables vendor neutrality. That means that no matter if you are a user, a company, or a country, you are not locked in to another company's technical stack, road map or licensing agreements [2]. Soon in the future, chip designers won't be locked into Intel or ARM with RISC-V. Thanks to the OpenRAN project, 5G network builders won't be forced to buy from Huawei, Nokia, or Ericsson, for example [2].</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
You might be thinking that by open sourcing a project, it becomes more vulnerable to attacks. The fact is that when exposing the codebase publicly, security experts have easy access to test it and improve the technology security. The operating system Linux and the cloud container orchestration system Kubernetes are good examples for security in open source.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Sharing Leads to Innovation</strong><br>
Community is the core of open source development. Contributing in a diverse and innovative environment helps to create an innovative organization for three reasons. First, developers will need to work with other people, explain how things work as well as ask for help (especially if you are a newcomer in the community :-) ). The acts of learning and teaching can bring a lot to everyone involved [3]. Second, open source communities have people with different skills, experiences, nationalities, and gender. By valuing an inclusive environment and having a lot of diversity, teams may become more innovative. Finally, open source has practices around transparency, reduction in hierarchy, and open communication, which encourage motivation and an innovative mindset.</p>
<p>To conclude, open source development depends on a passionate community of developers. To succeed in open source, I believe that there must be a continued collaboration between users, developers, and companies. Although open source development might have its issues (as every thing in life), the pros are more than the cons. Diverse team builds better projects, and better software is what open source is about.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">Database Normalization</a> can be complicated. The definitions of the various "normal forms" are academic and not very practical. All this can leave one feeling lost. Hopefully, this guide can help. <strong>This guide aims to be a practical, succinct guide to database normalization for the working software engineer.</strong> In what follows we will look at the first few normal forms and their properties in simple language. (If you just want a table of normal forms and their properties, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">this table</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-columns-and-special-columns">Basic columns and special columns</h2>
<p>In what follows I will refer to table columns as either "basic columns" or "special columns". When I say "basic", I really just mean "not special", which raises the core question of: <strong>What is meant by "special column"? Simply put, a special column is a column you could use to uniqely identify rows within a table.</strong><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> It is of critical important in database normalization to identify all the special columns of a table. This might naively seem easy to do, but determining the special columns of a table can quickly become a subtle and debatable business.</p>
<p>That said, there is one special column that is always straightforward, and will show up in essentially every production database table you will ever interact with: the serial <code>id</code> column. It's basically the <em>most</em> special column of all because it exists for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying rows in a table. It's so special in fact, that, really, it's too special, and so we will completely ignore it when discussing database normalization. I discuss this oddity in more detail in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-the-serial-id-column">Ignoring the serial <code>id</code> column</h3>
<p>The reason we ignore the serial <code>id</code> column is because what we are really looking for is the <em>naturally</em> special columns. We are looking for the fundamental attributes, or properties, of the entities in question. We want to normalize the "real" data, the data you <em>need</em> in order to appropriately describe the entities. The serial <code>id</code> column isn't "real" data, it's not a property of the entity, it's just tacked on to a row to guarantee unique identification. Only by normalizing against the "real" data will you actually gain the benefits of normalization, which are, among other things, less duplication and less redundancy.</p>
<p>So, while I will include the <code>id</code> column in examples, because that's the most practical way to interact with tables, please keep in mind that (1) we will be ignoring it, and (2) why we are choosing to do so (which, as a reminder, is because we are only concerned with "real" data).</p>
<h2 id="first-normal-form-1nf">First Normal Form, 1NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form">First Normal Form</a>, simply put, means <strong>don't put lists in table cells</strong>.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Putting a list in a cell is strongly discouraged unless you have a very good reason to do so. There are multiple datatypes that will allow you to do this, for example the <code>ARRAY</code> keyword in SQL, but just because you can doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>Before I discuss the most common way I see this violation occur, I want to briefly discuss JSON and JSONB data in table cells. JSON(B) is a valid data type, and has many justifiable use cases, including NoSQL-like data storage, but it should still be avoided unless you have a good reason to use it. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-json.html#JSON-DOC-DESIGN">Section 8.14.2</a> of the PostgreSQL docs states the following on this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, JSON documents should each represent an atomic datum that business rules dictate cannot reasonably be further subdivided into smaller datums that could be modified independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, probably the most common way you'll see 1NF being violated is with cells containing comma-separated values as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>books</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden,Green Eggs and Ham</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath,The Cat in the Hat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The solution to the problem is to create a row per book instead:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>The Cat in the Hat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>See Appendix A for a SQL<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> script that transforms the unnormalized example data into the 1NF data as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h2 id="second-normal-form-2nf">Second Normal Form, 2NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form">Second Normal Form</a>, simply put, means that, in addition to being in 1NF, <strong>every basic column is determined by <em>all</em> the special columns</strong>. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>An example 1NF table that violates 2NF is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book</th>
<th>price</th>

<p>The <code>price</code> column is determined completely by the <code>book</code> column, and nothing else. But, the special columns are both <code>book</code> <em>and</em> <code>name</code>. This partial determination of <code>price</code> by just <code>book</code>, and not also <code>name</code>, is a violation of 2NF. The logic here is that if a special column has no impact on a basic column, then the basic column probably shouldn't be in the table at all.</p>
<p>The solution is separating out the book details into a second table:</p>
<table>

<p>This is sufficient to satisfy 2nd Normal Form.<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>See Appendix B for a SQL script that transforms the 1NF table into 2NF tables as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h2 id="third-normal-form-3nf">Third Normal Form, 3NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">Third Normal Form</a>, simply put, means that, in addition to being in 2NF, <strong>every basic column is <em>directly</em> determined by the special columns</strong>.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> This might sound confusingly similar to 2NF, but the key difference is <em>direct</em> determination. 2NF still allows for <strong>in</strong>direct determination, otherwise known as transitively dependent determination.</p>
<p>An example 2NF table that is violating 3NF is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>loan_date</th>
<th>loanee</th>
<th>loanee_dob</th>
<th>book_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>2021-02-02</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>1900-01-01</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem is that <code>loanee_dob</code> is determined by <code>loanee</code>, but <code>loanee</code> is <em>not</em> one of the special columns, which are <code>book_id</code> and <code>loan_date</code>. It <em>is</em> true that, if you give me the special columns of <code>book_id</code> and <code>loan_date</code> I <em>will</em> find the <code>loanee_dob</code> unique to that row, but the "truth" of <code>loanee_dob</code> is <em>dependent</em> on the <code>loanee</code>. This indicates that the <code>loanee_dob</code> is <em>indirectly (i.e., transitively) dependent</em> on the special columns <em>through</em> the <code>loanee</code> column. This is the kind of indirectness we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>The solution is extracting the transitively dependent columns into their own table. For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>dob</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>

<p>See Appendix C for a SQL script that transforms the 2NF table into 3NF tables as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-boyce-codd-normal-form-bcnf-35nf">A note about Boyce-Codd Normal Form, BCNF, 3.5NF</h3>
<p>There are edge cases in the technical definition of 3NF that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF</a> attempts to address. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form#Definition_of_third_normal_form">This</a> is the best articulation of the difference between 3NF and BCNF/3.5NF that I've read, which occurs near the end of the section.) To the best of my knowledge, the simple takeaway is essentially the same it was for 3NF, i.e., <strong>every basic column is <em>directly</em> determined by the special columns</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-normal-form-4nf">Fourth Normal Form, 4NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">Fourth Normal Form</a>, in a sense, <em>cannot be put simply</em>. If I had to try, I'd say that 4NF, "simply put", means that, in addition to being in 3NF, <strong>if a group of cells across one or more columns can determine a group of cells in one or more <em>other</em> columns, then the original group of cells in the original column(s) must at least be in the special columns</strong>. Since that "simple" sentence barely makes sense, I'll just include the technical version, instead of hiding it in a footnote. The technical version is: Every non-trivial, <em>multivalued</em> functional dependency is derived from a superkey, minimal or otherwise.</p>
<p>I have not found a dataset that, in my opinion, is unequivocally both in 3NF and violating 4NF, so at the moment I do not have an example nor script to transform the relation. The wikipedia pages for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">3NF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">4NF</a> are good starting points for learning more about 4NF. When I find a good example, I will include it here.</p>
<h2 id="fifth-normal-form-and-beyond">Fifth Normal Form and beyond</h2>
<p>Things get quite academic and arguably non-practical after 4NF, and maybe actually after 3NF, although it does seems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form#4NF_in_practice">4NF violations do actually occur in practice</a>.</p>
<p>I will chose not to cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form">5NF</a> and other higher-order properties that can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">this table</a> (which I also linked to in the intro). It is an interesting field of research, so I encourage you to dig deeper and look into these properties yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you found this guide helpful. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out! Happy coding :D</p>

<p>This is probably not the best solution. It is a fully contained solution. You are encouraged to copy and paste and experiment with it. For example, if you saved this file as <code>example.sql</code>, you could run the following from the command line (assuming you are using PostgreSQL):</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> createdb <span>test</span></span>
<span>$</span><span> psql -d <span>test</span> -f example.sql</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similar functionality can be achieved with other datatypes. For example, if your data was in a <code>text ARRAY</code> data type, you could use <code>unnest(books)</code> instead of <code>regexp_split_to_table()</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> users;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> users (id <span>SERIAL</span> <span>PRIMARY KEY</span>, <span>name</span> <span>text</span>, books <span>text</span>);

The following brief post is once again offered largely for the sake of interest, being concerned with the furthest limits of the distribution of early Byzantine material in Eurasia and Africa. What follows consists of a distribution map of fifth- to seventh-century AD Byzantine finds and contemporary imitations accompanied by a brief discussion and illustration of some of the items that have been found in the far west, far east, far north and far south of the 'Old World'. Needless to say, the extensive distribution of early Byzantine material shown here is of interest for a number of reasons from the perspective of this blog, not least the light that it sheds on early medieval Britain's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">Byzantine</a> and <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/05/anglo-saxon-finds-france-africa.html">Indian Ocean</a>&nbsp;imports and connections discussed in previous posts.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far West (1)</b></p><p>

For both <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>, writing near Bethlehem in 396, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ZUhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+island+of+Britain+lies+virtually+at+the+end+of+the+world%22">Gildas</a>, writing around a century later in late fifth- or early sixth-century Britain, the British Isles lay 'virtually at the end of the world towards the west and north-west'. Despite this, there was clearly an intriguing degree of contact between the British Isles and the early Byzantine empire during the fifth to seventh centuries, as has been discussed at length in a <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">previous post</a>. In terms of the material evidence for this connection, this is manifested by significant finds of fifth- to sixth-century Eastern Mediterranean and North African <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">pottery</a> in western Britain and <a href="https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/3263">Ireland</a> (with around half of the total coming from the probable royal site of <a href="http://www.medievalhistories.com/luxury-tintagel-early-medieval-period/">Tintagel</a>, Cornwall), alongside Byzantine <a href="https://www.academia.edu/11482638/_Early_Byzantine_copper_coins_found_in_Britain_A_review_of_new_finds_recorded_with_the_Portable_Antiquities_Scheme_Ancient_History_Numismatics_and_Epigraphy_in_the_Mediterranean_World_ed._Og%C5%ADz_Tekin_Yayinlari_Istanbul_2009_263-274">coins</a>, metalwork, and a number of burials of people whose <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/10/oxygen-isotope-evidence.html">isotope results</a> indicate that they could well have grown up in Byzantine North Africa. It has <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kIMmDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">often</a> been <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">suggested</a> that the material in the west may have arrived via a different mechanism to that in the east, perhaps representing direct, official contact via the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic coast vs indirect transfer via merchants and elite exchange along the rivers of mainland Europe, although finds of late sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine coins from the Anglo-Saxon royal site of Rendlesham, Suffolk, have recently been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/div-classtitlesocial-and-economic-complexity-in-early-medieval-england-a-central-place-complex-of-the-east-anglian-kingdom-at-rendlesham-suffolkdiv/FE9E1DB3180F1390E97D97BF28B637D5">interpreted</a> as evidence for 'direct mercantile contacts' with the Byzantine world in eastern Britain too.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far East (2, 3, 4)</b></p><p>

If there is a substantial amount of early Byzantine material found in Britain and Ireland, the apparent westernmost extremity of the known world in late antiquity, there is also a notable quantity at the far eastern end too. In <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>'s letter, cited above, the rhetorical opposite extremity of the world to Britain was given as India, but Roman and Byzantine authors were certainly aware of the existence of China and parts of Southeast Asia. China was, for example, mentioned by <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp261_Roman_Chinese.pdf">Roman</a> and <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">early Byzantine</a> writers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Roman_geography">first century BC onwards</a> and it is included not only in Ptolemy's second-century AD <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg">Geography</a></i> (which mentions parts of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg">Southeast Asia</a> too), but also on the <i><a href="http://www.euratlas.net/cartogra/peutinger/11_india/india_8_2.html">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></i>, a fascinating map that seems to have had its origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana">Late Roman period</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Roman</a> and especially <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Chinese sources</a> make several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Possible_Roman_Greeks_in_Burma_and_China">references</a> to Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine entertainers, merchants and/or embassies being present in China and Southeast Asia, including a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">mission in 166 AD</a> that arrived via the south coast—probably entering China via Vietnam and claiming to have been sent by the Roman emperor <i>Andun</i> (Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus?), although this was perhaps really a commercial action that chose to represent itself this way—and numerous seventh- and eighth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Fulin:_Eastern_Roman_embassies">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://byzantineperspectives.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/what-does-tang-china-have-in-common-with-anglo-saxon-england/">embassies</a>&nbsp;to Tang China.</p><p>

In terms of the early Byzantine material found in eastern parts of Eurasia, there is a variety of surviving artefacts ranging from glass vessels, metalwork and textiles through to gold and bronze coinage, with the latter being by far the most numerous category. The most easterly early Byzantine artefacts are actually found in Korea and Japan ('2' on the map, above). The former has seen finds of <a href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/glass-vessels/cwFZdR3ccuXZ-w?hl=en">glass vessels</a> from the late fifth- to early sixth-century AD royal tombs at <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm">Silla, Korea</a>, some of which appear to have actually been <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpanKmU_ckYC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">made in</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-19-1-1.pdf">the early Byzantine empire</a> and others of which are believed to be <a href="http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Silk_Roads/The_Eastern_Silk_Roads_Story_2015_Conference_Proceedings_UNESCO_re.pdf">imitative</a> of Late Roman/Early Byzantine forms, whilst in Japan there have been not only finds of early Byzantine 'Levantine 1' <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284359734_Archaeometrical_investigation_of_natron_glass_excavated_in_Japan">glass beads</a> (probably made on the coast of present-day northern Israel) from fifth-century AD tombs, but the important mid-eighth-century AD imperial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8Di">Shōsōin Repository</a> at Nara, Japan, is also reported to contain a number of Byzantine items including a <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp206_sasanian_persia.pdf">cushion cover</a> made in early Byzantine Syria. Interestingly, neither Japan nor Korea is mentioned in Roman or Byzantine sources, although a recent isotopic and mitochondrial DNA <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236210479_Stable_isotope_and_mtDNA_evidence_for_geographic_origins_at_the_site_of_Vagnari_South_Italy">study of burials</a> on the Imperial estate at Vagnari, southern Italy, has indicated that one of the adults buried there in the first or second century AD could have had Japanese ancestry, given that 'all modern mtDNA matches to her available haplotype sequence are from Japan'.<sup><a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html#fn2">(2)</a></sup></p><p>

In addition to this material from the very far east, we also have a notable quantity of primarily sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">gold coins</a> and sixth- to eighth-century imitations from <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">tombs in China</a>, along with a number of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C9A7DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;pg=RA1-PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">finds</a> of early Byzantine metalwork and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-06_M-L._Chen,_The_Importation_of_Byzantine_and_Sasanian_Glass_into_China_during_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries.pdf">glassware</a> (and imitations of the same) from this country too. Both this material and that discussed in the preceding paragraph is <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">often thought</a> <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">to have arrived</a> via Central Asia along the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>', especially given the presence of a number of <a href="https://www.academia.edu/27959139/Sogdiana_its_Christians_and_Byzantium_a_Study_of_Artistic_and_Cultural_Connections_in_Late_Antiquity_and_Early_Middle_Ages">similar finds</a> in areas such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, although some of the Byzantine items found close to the Chinese coast and in Korea and Japan could have alternatively arrived by the less-discussed southern, maritime 'branch' of the Silk Road instead. Certainly, earlier <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Roman</a> and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Greek</a> <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12682533/The_Power_of_Images_Coin_Portraits_of_Roman_Emperors_on_Jewellery_Pendants_in_Early_Southeast_Asia">mariners</a>&nbsp;made use of this route, and early Byzantine <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">written sources</a> moreover appear to make reference to it, whilst finds of fifth- to seventh-century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinrgreen/status/832976763626078211">glassware</a>&nbsp;in Japan are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/28504387/Priestman_2016_The_Silk_Road_or_the_Sea_Sasanian_and_Islamic_Exports_to_Japan">argued</a> to have probably arrived there via the sea route. With regard to this maritime 'road', another relevant find may well be that of a probably sixth-century Byzantine <a href="http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_096_0b_Borrell_EarlyByzantineLampFromPongTuk.pdf">lamp</a> found in Thailand (marked as '3' on the map, above), and it is worth noting in this context that an East Javanese <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LhaWBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><i>millefiori</i></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebeadsite.com/abm-rio3.html">bead</a> of sixth-century date has been found at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_Troglodytica">Berenike</a> too (curiously, such beads are <a href="http://www.aihv.org/en/pdf/16-77.pdf">very rare indeed</a> outside of East Java, with the only other concentration really being in the Silla tombs of Korea, mentioned above!).</p><p>

Finally, thousands of fifth- to seventh-century <a href="http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5357/1/Darley14PhD_redacted.pdf">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/10027506/Self_Other_and_the_Use_and_Appropriation_of_Late_Roman_coins_in_south_India_and_Sri_Lanka_4th-7th_centuries_A.D._">gold</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271621898_Roman_Coins_from_the_Masson_and_Mackenzie_Collections_in_the_British_Museum">bronze</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292142132_The_Role_of_Monetary_Networks_in_the_Trade_between_India_and_the_Roman_Empire">coins</a> and imitations are known from India and Sri Lanka ('4' on the map), accompanied by fifth- to sixth-century <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk:8081/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-02_K._R._Dark,_Globalizing_Late_Antiquity.pdf">amphorae</a> on coastal and inland sites in western India.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico"><p>The year is 1964. The United States and the Soviet Union have narrowly avoided full-scale nuclear destruction and resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War looms on the horizon, and Mao Zedong’s China—fresh off a split with the Soviets—has just successfully blown up its first atomic bomb in a dry lakebed in southeastern Xinjiang, near what is now the <a href="https://www.wildcamels.com/what-we-do/lop-nur-nature-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest reserve for Bactrian camels</a>. </p><p>China’s nuclear test announced the country as the world’s fifth nuclear-armed nation, though unlike France, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese nuclear program was a black box for American intelligence. <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb488/docs/Doc%2028%2011-2-64%20inr%20on%20chinese%20test.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recently declassified government files show</a>, for example, that the U.S. was shocked to learn that the bomb was fueled by uranium, not plutonium. Military-industrial honchos were left scratching their heads as to how to gather intelligence, until a chance meeting between General Curtis LeMay and mountaineer Barry Bishop at a Washington D.C. cocktail party led to one of the most quixotic, unsuccessful operations in the CIA’s long history of screwups.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="792" height="612" src="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg 792w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=62,48 62w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px"><figcaption><a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb488/docs/doc%2033%201-0-65%20circa%20AFtAC%20report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Air Force analysis</a> of nuclear debris scatter, which confirmed the use of enriched uranium. The lower of the two large arrows flows from the Xinjiang test site.</figcaption></figure><p>Bishop was part of the first American team to summit Mt. Everest the year prior, and according to <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Takeda’s fascinating 2007 <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>, he gushed about the unobstructed views he enjoyed from the world’s (<a href="https://defector.com/a-geologist-rocks-my-world-on-why-earths-tallest-mountain-isnt-so-obvious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguably</a>) tallest mountain. Takeda writes that LeMay put the pieces together and, “From this casual exchange emerged an unlikely inspiration: Recruit America’s best high-altitude climbers to place a nuclear powered observation device atop the world’s greatest mountain range.” The hope was that a transceiver could pick up radio communications between Chinese nuclear personnel, remaining functional for years off of the heat from decaying plutonium isotopes. Per Takeda, the CIA’s device was an “oven-sized metal bin with five radiating fins” that weighed 125 pounds and was topped by a six-foot long antenna. If this sounds like a crude product of ’60s nuclear frenzy, consider that <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/electrical-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s Perseverance rover</a> is scooting around on Mars thanks to this exact sort of battery. </p><p>Bishop could no longer climb high alpine peaks after <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/first-successful-us-everest-summit-took-a-toll-on-barry-bishops-boots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing all of his toes in the Everest expedition</a>, but by 1965, the CIA started putting together a team, picked a name (Operation Hat), and chose a mountain. Everest straddled China’s border, so it was out of contention. CIA officials eventually chose Nanda Devi, the tallest peak entirely within India’s borders. Nanda Devi offered two advantages to the Americans: long sightlines into Western China and the help of an Indian state that the U.S. had just supported in its 1962 border skirmish with China. </p><p>At this point in history, Nanda Devi had only been summited by six people, with three others dying in the process, so the CIA recruited a dream team of famous American climbers. The corps included pioneering El Capitan big-waller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/obituaries/tom-frost-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Frost</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/07/us/luther-jerstad-61-alpinist-who-scaled-everest-in-1963.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1963 Everest</a> veteran Lute Jerstad, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> cover darling <a href="https://gripped.com/profiles/jim-mccarthy-was-first-climber-on-sports-illustrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim McCarthy</a>, and the unsung alpinist <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(16)31088-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Schaller</a>. They <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a training course</a> on nuclear technology and “the Asian mentality” at a South Carolina military base, though the climbers say they mostly spent time “playing volleyball and doing some serious drinking.” <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full team undertook a training mission on Mount McKinley</a> in June with their Indian counterparts, and even though “distressing weather and other difficulties kept them from the summit,” the CIA “chose to ignore” the omens and the American-Indian team set out for Nanda Devi in October 1965. </p><p>The CIA has not yet declassified files from the expedition, including apparently extensive photographs and journal records made by Schaller, so we do not have a detailed account of what happened on the mountain. But we do know how the mission ended: catastrophic failure. A storm pinned several climbers and the device down while they were roughly 1,800 feet from the summit. Indian intelligence lead Capt. M.S. Kohli was forced to call a retreat, and the team stashed the device in a crevice and attempted to anchor it in place, so it would stay put until they could come and retrieve it on the other side of winter.</p><p>McCarthy spoke at length with Takeda <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>—which really is great, Takeda makes his own attempt on Nanda Devi and narrowly escapes death by avalanche—and he recalled his fury at the expedition’s failure:</p><blockquote><p>When I realize that they’re dumping the fucking generator and going down the mountain, I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you doing? Have them bring it down! Are you crazy?’ I’m yelling at the top of my lungs.” According to McCarthy, the CIA case officer nearly had to pull him off Kohli. “He says to me,” McCarthy says, ‘You are creating an international incident!’”</p><p>“But,” McCarthy adds, “I had a vision of absolute clarity. We’re going to lose a SNAP generator, powered by plutonium, in the headwaters of the Ganges!”</p><cite><a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock And Ice</a></cite></blockquote><p>That might be what wound up happening. Nobody knows where the device ended up, since it disappeared from Nanda Devi at some point in the winter. The CIA ran a total of eight field operations in the region between 1965 and 1968, aimed at both finding the first device and getting another one up and running. Though they eventually implanted a plutonium device on nearby Nanda Kot, they have never been able to find their lost transceiver. The successfully placed device was also quickly buried under the snow and stopped working months later, after producing no useful intelligence.</p><p>The grim failure of Operation Hat resurfaced this month after violent floods killed over 50 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The floods <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/asia/india-glacier-flood-uttarakhand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most likely began</a> when a chunk of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off and trapped flowing water, forming a lake that eventually burst through and swept through nearby valleys. The undeniable oddness of a glacial breaking apart during the winter has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56102459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led some locals to speculate</a> that perhaps the plutonium generator, which is still likely producing heat, led to the deadly floods.</p><p>There’s no evidence for the hypothesis, though even after years of reconnaissance missions and rigorous chemical assays of the surrounding area, nobody knows where the CIA’s lost nuclear-powered spy oven is. </p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>
